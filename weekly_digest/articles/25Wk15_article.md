## [2025Wk15]: From algorithms to architecture: AI gets grounded in silicon

After a sustained period of research focused on building embodied agents, refining machine reasoning, and developing specialized professional benchmarks, the field is now confronting the immense computational demands these advances create. The push to make AI more capable in the physical and professional worlds has revealed a critical bottleneck: performance. This week’s papers show a decisive shift toward solving this problem at its root, moving beyond purely algorithmic optimizations to a deeper integration of hardware and software. The focus is on grounding abstract intelligence in silicon, co-designing the entire computational stack to build systems that are not just smarter, but fundamentally faster and more efficient.

### Co-designing the computational stack

The gap between algorithmic potential and real-world performance is increasingly being closed by hardware-software co-design. This approach abandons the traditional separation between software and the metal it runs on, instead creating tightly integrated systems where each is optimized for the other. A new programming model called Cypress, for example, is designed specifically for NVIDIA’s Hopper GPU architecture, allowing developers to orchestrate complex data movement and computation between asynchronous units without managing low-level details. [cite: 2504.07004] Similar efforts are tailoring AI workloads to different hardware, from scalable dataflow architectures for LLM inference on FPGAs to novel ferroelectric FET-based memory architectures that accelerate KV cache pruning. [cite: 2504.09561, 2504.07479] This trend extends even to emerging hardware paradigms. One project optimized spiking neural networks for general-purpose RISC-V multicore clusters by introducing a low-overhead extension for streaming sparse computations, achieving a 4.39x speedup. [cite: 2504.06134] Another framework uses ReRAM devices to implement the entire stochastic computing flow in-memory, from bit-stream generation to computation, improving throughput and energy efficiency over traditional solutions. [cite: 2504.0834]

### Intelligent agents meet efficient systems

The drive for hardware efficiency is directly enabling the deployment of more capable intelligent agents. While recent research has focused on enhancing agents' reasoning and collaborative abilities, this week’s work demonstrates how system-level optimizations make these agents practical. The SkillWeaver framework allows an agent to autonomously discover and synthesize reusable skills as lightweight APIs, which can then be shared among various web agents to improve performance on new tasks. [cite: 2504.07079] Another highly robust framework based on the ReAct paradigm enhances decision-making by dynamically generating the next action based on prior trajectories rather than a fixed plan. [cite: 2504.0465] These more sophisticated agentic systems are computationally demanding, which is why performance is a key focus. To address hybrid CPU-GPU inference for Mixture-of-Experts models, the HybriMoE framework introduces a novel scheduling and cache management system that improves resource utilization, achieving a speedup of up to 1.70x in the decoding stage. [cite: 2504.05897] This synergy is critical: smarter agent logic requires more efficient underlying systems to run effectively.

### Engineering the data flywheel

The performance of these advanced, co-designed systems is ultimately dependent on the quality of the data used for training. Recognizing this, researchers are engineering data with the same rigor they apply to hardware and software, often using synthetic data generation to overcome the limitations of real-world datasets. The TCKR pipeline, for instance, uses parameter-efficient diffusion model fine-tuning and generative knowledge distillation to create synthetic datasets for image classification that can match or exceed the performance of models trained on real images, while also enhancing privacy. [cite: 2504.04582] In a similar vein, the S2R-HDR framework introduces a large-scale synthetic dataset for high dynamic range image fusion, using a domain adapter to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world data. [cite: 2504.07667] This data-centric approach extends to specialized domains like robotics, where Gaussian Splatting is now being used to create high-quality, context-aware synthetic data for instance segmentation, a process that requires only a video of the target object. [cite: 2504.08473] By treating data as an engineered component, these methods provide the high-quality fuel needed for both efficient training and robust generalization.

### The new frontiers of interaction

Ultimately, more efficient and intelligent systems are valuable because they enable new and richer forms of human-AI interaction. This week’s research shows how performance gains at the system level are translating into more intuitive and natural user experiences. The "Thoughtful AI" paradigm proposes a shift from turn-based, input-output models to an AI that behaves as a continuously thinking entity, proactively generating and communicating its evolving thought process. [cite: 2502.18676] This vision of a more collaborative partner is also explored in a new framework that compares a recommendation-based AI with an "ExtendAI" that builds upon a user's own decision-making rationale, finding the latter integrates better with human thinking. [cite: 2504.06771] These advanced interaction models are being applied in tangible ways, from using speech emotion to command agents to designing social robots that can better interpret human cues. [cite: 2504.0844, 2504.06167] Even novel physical interfaces are being developed, such as "Objestures," which combine physical objects and mid-air gestures to create a more expressive and tangible way to interact with 3D content. [cite: 2503.02973]

In conclusion, this week's research paints a clear picture of a field maturing from abstract algorithms to integrated systems. The focus on co-designing the computational stack is a direct response to the demands of deploying more intelligent agents. These agents, in turn, are being powered by better-engineered synthetic data. Together, these advancements are enabling new frontiers of interaction that make AI a more seamless and effective collaborator. This trend suggests a future where the intelligence of an AI is measured not just by its algorithmic elegance, but by its grounded performance in the silicon and in the world.
