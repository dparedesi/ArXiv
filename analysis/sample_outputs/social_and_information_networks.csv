2501.00417,"This study focuses on parameter-free importance measures, based on the recursive definition of importance (RDI), for network nodes. The best-known examples of such RDI-based measures are eigenvector centrality and Seeley centrality, but they are applicable only to strongly connected networks. In contrast, Katz centrality and its variants, including PageRank, are RDI-inspired measures that introduce free parameters to handle general networks. This motivates the overlooked question of whether an RDI-based measure can be defined for arbitrary networks without introducing free parameters. This question is addressed by introducing $PureRank$, a parameter-free recursive importance measure. PureRank proceeds in three steps: (i) nodes are classified into recurrent, transient, and dangling classes via strongly connected component decomposition; (ii) local importance vectors for these classes are formulated as solutions to Katz parameter optimization problems aimed at best approximating eigenvector centrality within each class; and (iii) these vectors are aggregated into global scores via the RDI principle. This modular design enables parallel and incremental computation. PureRank also admits a probabilistic interpretation via a random-surfer model. The effectiveness and characteristics of PureRank are evaluated through numerical experiments on large-scale real-world networks, in comparison with PageRank. Finally, extension of PureRank to multi-attribute networks is discussed."
2501.00779,"In social online platforms, identifying influential seed users to maximize influence spread is a crucial as it can greatly diminish the cost and efforts required for information dissemination. While effective, traditional methods for Multiplex Influence Maximization (MIM) have reached their performance limits, prompting the emergence of learning-based approaches. These novel methods aim for better generalization and scalability for more sizable graphs but face significant challenges, such as (1) inability to handle unknown diffusion patterns and (2) reliance on high-quality training samples. To address these issues, we propose the Reinforced Expert Maximization framework (REM). REM leverages a Propagation Mixture of Experts technique to encode dynamic propagation of large multiplex networks effectively in order to generate enhanced influence propagation. Noticeably, REM treats a generative model as a policy to autonomously generate different seed sets and learn how to improve them from a Reinforcement Learning perspective. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that REM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of influence spread, scalability, and inference time in influence maximization tasks."
2501.01203,"Academic question answering (QA) in heterogeneous scholarly networks presents unique challenges requiring both structural understanding and interpretable reasoning. While graph neural networks (GNNs) capture structured graph information and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in semantic comprehension, current approaches lack integration at the reasoning level. We propose HetGCoT, a framework enabling LLMs to effectively leverage and learn information from graphs to reason interpretable academic QA results. Our framework introduces three technical contributions: (1) a framework that transforms heterogeneous graph structural information into LLM-processable reasoning chains, (2) an adaptive metapath selection mechanism identifying relevant subgraphs for specific queries, and (3) a multi-step reasoning strategy systematically incorporating graph contexts into the reasoning process. Experiments on OpenAlex and DBLP datasets show our approach outperforms all sota baselines. The framework demonstrates adaptability across different LLM architectures and applicability to various scholarly question answering tasks."
2501.01884,"Telegram emerged as a crucial platform for both parties during the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Per its minimal policies for content moderation, Pro-Kremlin narratives and potential misinformation were spread on Telegram, while anti-Kremlin narratives with related content were also propagated, such as war footage, troop movements, maps of bomb shelters, and air raid warnings. This paper presents a dataset of posts from both pro-Kremlin and anti-Kremlin Telegram channels, collected over a period spanning a year before and a year after the Russian invasion. The dataset comprises 404 pro-Kremlin channels with 4,109,645 posts and 114 anti-Kremlin channels with 1,117,768 posts. We provide details on the data collection process, processing methods, and dataset characterization. Lastly, we discuss the potential research opportunities this dataset may enable researchers across various disciplines."
2501.01974,"Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning has become a hot topic due to its great value in many practical tasks. The key to TKG reasoning is modeling the structural information and evolutional patterns of the TKGs. While great efforts have been devoted to TKG reasoning, the structural and evolutional characteristics of real-world networks have not been considered. In the aspect of structure, real-world networks usually exhibit clear community structure and scale-free (long-tailed distribution) properties. In the aspect of evolution, the impact of an event decays with the time elapsing. In this paper, we propose a novel TKG reasoning model called Hawkes process-based Evolutional Representation Learning Network (HERLN), which learns structural information and evolutional patterns of a TKG simultaneously, considering the characteristics of real-world networks: community structure, scale-free and temporal decaying. First, we find communities in the input TKG to make the encoding get more similar intra-community embeddings. Second, we design a Hawkes process-based relational graph convolutional network to cope with the event impact-decaying phenomenon. Third, we design a conditional decoding method to alleviate biases towards frequent entities caused by long-tailed distribution. Experimental results show that HERLN achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art models."
2501.02192,"Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) encapsulate diverse entity and relation types, with meta-paths providing essential meta-level semantics for knowledge reasoning, although their utility is constrained by discovery challenges. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new prospects for meta-path discovery due to their extensive knowledge encoding and efficiency, their adaptation faces challenges such as corpora bias, lexical discrepancies, and hallucination. This paper pioneers the mitigation of these challenges by presenting EvoPath, an innovative framework that leverages LLMs to efficiently identify high-quality meta-paths. EvoPath is carefully designed, with each component aimed at addressing issues that could lead to potential knowledge conflicts. With a minimal subset of HIN facts, EvoPath iteratively generates and evolves meta-paths by dynamically replaying meta-paths in the buffer with prioritization based on their scores. Comprehensive experiments on three large, complex HINs with hundreds of relations demonstrate that our framework, EvoPath, enables LLMs to generate high-quality meta-paths through effective prompting, confirming its superior performance in HIN reasoning tasks. Further ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each module within the framework."
2501.02194,"Multilayer graphs, consisting of multiple interconnected layers, are widely used to model diverse relationships in the real world. A community is a cohesive subgraph that offers valuable insights for analyzing (multilayer) graphs. Recently, there has been an emerging trend focused on searching query-driven communities within the multilayer graphs. However, existing methods for multilayer community search are either 1) rule-based, which suffer from structure inflexibility; or 2) learning-based, which rely on labeled data or fail to capture layer-specific characteristics. To address these, we propose EnMCS, an Ensemble-based unsupervised (i.e., label-free) Multilayer Community Search framework. EnMCS contains two key components, i.e., HoloSearch which identifies potential communities in each layer while integrating both layer-shared and layer-specific information, and EMerge which is an Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based method that synthesizes the potential communities from each layer into a consensus community. Specifically, HoloSearch first employs a graph-diffusion-based model that integrates three label-free loss functions to learn layer-specific and layer-shared representations for each node. Communities in each layer are then identified based on nodes that exhibit high similarity in layer-shared representations while demonstrating low similarity in layer-specific representations w.r.t. the query nodes. To account for the varying layer-specific characteristics of each layer when merging communities, EMerge models the error rates of layers and true community as latent variables. It then employs the EM algorithm to simultaneously minimize the error rates of layers and predict the final consensus community through iterative maximum likelihood estimation. Experiments over 10 real-world datasets highlight the superiority of EnMCS in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness."
2501.02288,"Past experiments show that reputation or the knowledge of peers' past cooperation can enhance cooperation in human social networks. On the other hand, the knowledge of peers' wealth undermines cooperativeness, and that of peers' interconnectedness and network structure does not affect it. However, it is unknown if making peers' subjective well-being (SWB) available or visible in social networks may enhance or undermine cooperation. Therefore, we implemented online network experiments (N = 662 in 50 networked groups with 15 rounds of interactions), in which study participants cooperated with or defected against connected peers through Public Goods Game, made and cut social ties with others, and rated their SWB. We manipulated the visibility of connected peers' SWB (25 visible vs. 25 invisible SWB networked groups) while keeping the connected peers' reputation and in-game wealth visible. Results show that making the peers/ SWB visible did not alter overall cooperativeness, wealth, inter-connectedness, or SWB. In contrast, the visible SWB networked groups exhibited a higher number of communities and lower transitivity (the proportion of the cases where a peer of a peer is also a peer) than the invisible SWB networked groups. These phenomena are explained by an altered decision-making pattern in the visible SWB networks: cooperators were less likely to connect with cooperators and more likely to connect with defectors, and consequently, cooperators could not maintain their popularity or stay in the center of the networks."
2501.02851,"We study community detection in multiple networks with jointly correlated node attributes and edges. This setting arises naturally in applications such as social platforms, where a shared set of users may exhibit both correlated friendship patterns and correlated attributes across different platforms. Extending the classical Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and its contextual counterpart (Contextual SBM or CSBM), we introduce the correlated CSBM, which incorporates structural and attribute correlations across graphs. To build intuition, we first analyze correlated Gaussian Mixture Models, wherein only correlated node attributes are available without edges, and identify the conditions under which an estimator minimizing the distance between attributes achieves exact matching of nodes across the two databases. For the correlated CSBMs, we develop a two-step procedure that first applies $k$-core matching to most nodes using edge information, then refines the matching for the remaining unmatched nodes by leveraging their attributes with a distance-based estimator. We identify the conditions under which the algorithm recovers the exact node correspondence, enabling us to merge the correlated edges and average the correlated attributes for enhanced community detection. Crucially, by aligning and combining graphs, we identify regimes in which community detection is impossible in a single graph but becomes feasible when side information from correlated graphs is incorporated. Our results illustrate how the interplay between graph matching and community recovery can boost performance, broadening the scope of multi-graph, attribute-based community detection."
2501.04408,"Semantic communication is a new paradigm that aims at providing more efficient communication for the next-generation wireless network. It focuses on transmitting extracted, meaningful information instead of the raw data. However, deep learning-enabled image semantic communication models often require a significant amount of time and energy for training, which is unacceptable, especially for mobile devices. To solve this challenge, our paper first introduces a distributed image semantic communication system where the base station and local devices will collaboratively train the models for uplink communication. Furthermore, we formulate a joint optimization problem to balance time and energy consumption on the local devices during training while ensuring effective model performance. An adaptable resource allocation algorithm is proposed to meet requirements under different scenarios, and its time complexity, solution quality, and convergence are thoroughly analyzed. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in resource allocation optimization against existing benchmarks and discuss its impact on the performance of image semantic communication systems."
2501.04418,"Dynamic social networks can be conceptualized as sequences of dyadic interactions between individuals over time. The relational event model has been the workhorse to analyze such interaction sequences in empirical social network research. When addressing possible unobserved heterogeneity in the interaction mechanisms, standard approaches, such as the stochastic block model, aim to cluster the variation at the actor level. Though useful, the implied latent structure of the adjacency matrix is restrictive which may lead to biased interpretations and insights. To address this shortcoming, we introduce a more flexible dyadic latent class relational event model (DLC-REM) that captures the unobserved heterogeneity at the dyadic level. Through numerical simulations, we provide a proof of concept demonstrating that this approach is more general than latent actor-level approaches. To illustrate the applicability of the model, we apply it to a dataset of militarized interstate conflicts between countries."
2501.04578,"The climatic change is one of the serious concerns nowadays. The impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. Moreover, a small perturbation in climatic changes affects not only the pristine ecosystem but also the socioeconomic sectors. Specifically, the affect of climatic changes is related to frequent casualties. This makes it essential to dwelve deeper into analyzing the socio-climatic trends and variability. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of India's climatic trends, emphasizing on regional variations and specifically delving into the unique climate of Delhi. Specifically, this research unveils the temporal and spatial variations in temperature patterns by amalgamating extensive datasets encompassing India's diverse landscapes. The study uses advanced statistical tools and methodologies to scrutinize temperature's annual and seasonal variability. The insights drawn from this rigorous analysis may offer invaluable contributions to regional planning strategies, adaptive measures, and informed decision-making amidst the complex impacts of climate change. By bridging the gap between broader climatic trends and localized impacts, this research aims to facilitate more effective measures to mitigate and adapt to the multifaceted challenges of climate change, ensuring a more nuanced and tailored approaches. We utilized the Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen's slope estimator to analyze the trends and variability of the climatic conditions over the decades. The results demonstrate that temperature variations have increased over 0.58oC on average over the last decade. Moreover, over last decade the variability of Indian states shows that Lakshadweep faced the highest change (0.87oC), highlighting coastal vulnerability, while Tripura observed the least change of 0.07oC."
2501.04796,"We focus on the potential fragility of democratic elections given modern information-communication technologies (ICT) in the Web 2.0 era. Our work provides an explanation for the cascading attrition of public officials recently in the United States and offers potential policy interventions from a dynamic system's perspective. We propose that micro-level heterogeneity across individuals within crucial institutions leads to vulnerabilities of election support systems at the macro scale. Our analysis provides comparative statistics to measure the fragility of systems against targeted harassment, disinformation campaigns, and other adversarial manipulations that are now cheaper to scale and deploy. Our analysis also informs policy interventions that seek to retain public officials and increase voter turnout. We show how limited resources (for example, salary incentives to public officials and targeted interventions to increase voter turnout) can be allocated at the population level to improve these outcomes and maximally enhance democratic resilience. On the one hand, structural and individual heterogeneity cause systemic fragility that adversarial actors can exploit, but also provide opportunities for effective interventions that offer significant global improvements from limited and localized actions."
2501.0482,"The proliferation of ideological movements into extremist factions via social media has become a global concern. While radicalization has been studied extensively within the context of specific ideologies, our ability to accurately characterize extremism in more generalizable terms remains underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a novel method for extracting and analyzing extremist discourse across a range of online community forums. By focusing on verbal behavioral signatures of extremist traits, we develop a framework for quantifying extremism at both user and community levels. Our research identifies 11 distinct factors, which we term ``The Extremist Eleven,'' as a generalized psychosocial model of extremism. Applying our method to various online communities, we demonstrate an ability to characterize ideologically diverse communities across the 11 extremist traits. We demonstrate the power of this method by analyzing user histories from members of the incel community. We find that our framework accurately predicts which users join the incel community up to 10 months before their actual entry with an AUC of $>0.6$, steadily increasing to AUC ~0.9 three to four months before the event. Further, we find that upon entry into an extremist forum, the users tend to maintain their level of extremism within the community, while still remaining distinguishable from the general online discourse. Our findings contribute to the study of extremism by introducing a more holistic, cross-ideological approach that transcends traditional, trait-specific models."
2501.05171,"Rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) have not only empowered autonomous agents to generate social networks, communicate, and form shared and diverging opinions on political issues, but have also begun to play a growing role in shaping human political deliberation. Our understanding of their collective behaviours and underlying mechanisms remains incomplete, however, posing unexpected risks to human society. In this paper, we simulate a networked system involving thousands of large language model agents, discovering their social interactions, guided through LLM conversation, result in human-like polarization. We discover that these agents spontaneously develop their own social network with human-like properties, including homophilic clustering, but also shape their collective opinions through mechanisms observed in the real world, including the echo chamber effect. Similarities between humans and LLM agents -- encompassing behaviours, mechanisms, and emergent phenomena -- raise concerns about their capacity to amplify societal polarization, but also hold the potential to serve as a valuable testbed for identifying plausible strategies to mitigate polarization and its consequences."
2501.05292,"With the recent advancements in social network platform technology, an overwhelming amount of information is spreading rapidly. In this situation, it can become increasingly difficult to discern what information is false or true. If false information proliferates significantly, it can lead to undesirable outcomes. Hence, when we receive some information, we can pose the following two questions: $(i)$ Is the information true? $(ii)$ If not, who initially spread that information? % The first problem is the rumor detection issue, while the second is the rumor source detection problem. A rumor-detection problem involves identifying and mitigating false or misleading information spread via various communication channels, particularly online platforms and social media. Rumors can range from harmless ones to deliberately misleading content aimed at deceiving or manipulating audiences. Detecting misinformation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of information ecosystems and preventing harmful effects such as the spread of false beliefs, polarization, and even societal harm. Therefore, it is very important to quickly distinguish such misinformation while simultaneously finding its source to block it from spreading on the network. However, most of the existing surveys have analyzed these two issues separately. In this work, we first survey the existing research on the rumor-detection and rumor source detection problems with joint detection approaches, simultaneously. % This survey deals with these two issues together so that their relationship can be observed and it provides how the two problems are similar and different. The limitations arising from the rumor detection, rumor source detection, and their combination problems are also explained, and some challenges to be addressed in future works are presented."
2501.05423,"Studying public sentiment during crises is crucial for understanding how opinions and sentiments shift, resulting in polarized societies. We study Weibo, the most popular microblogging site in China, using posts made during the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis. The study period includes the pre-COVID-19 stage, the outbreak stage, and the early stage of epidemic prevention. We use Llama 3 8B, a Large Language Model, to analyze users' sentiments on the platform by classifying them into positive, negative, sarcastic, and neutral categories. Analyzing sentiment shifts on Weibo provides insights into how social events and government actions influence public opinion. This study contributes to understanding the dynamics of social sentiments during health crises, fulfilling a gap in sentiment analysis for Chinese platforms. By examining these dynamics, we aim to offer valuable perspectives on digital communication's role in shaping society's responses during unprecedented global challenges."
2501.05636,"Spatial networks are widely used in various fields to represent and analyze interactions or relationships between locations or spatially distributedthis http URLis a network science concept known as the 'rich club' phenomenon, which describes the tendency of 'rich' nodes to form densely interconnected sub-networks. Although there are established methods to quantify topological, weighted, and temporal rich clubs individually, there is limited research on measuring the rich club effect in spatially-weighted temporal networks, which could be particularly useful for studying dynamic spatial interaction networks. To address this gap, we introduce the spatially-weighted temporal rich club (WTRC), a metric that quantifies the strength and consistency of connections between rich nodes in a spatiotemporal network. Additionally, we present a unified rich club framework that distinguishes the WTRC effect from other rich club effects, providing a way to measure topological, weighted, and temporal rich club effects together. Through two case studies of human mobility networks at different spatial scales, we demonstrate how the WTRC is able to identify significant weighted temporal rich club effects, whereas the unweighted equivalent in the same network either fails to detect a rich club effect or inaccurately estimates its significance. In each case study, we explore the spatial layout and temporal variations revealed by the WTRC analysis, showcasing its particular value in studying spatiotemporal interaction networks. This research offers new insights into the study of spatiotemporal networks, with critical implications for applications such as transportation, redistricting, and epidemiology."
2501.05871,"The Fediverse, a group of interconnected servers providing a variety of interoperable services (e.g. micro-blogging in Mastodon) has gained rapid popularity. This sudden growth, partly driven by Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, has created challenges for administrators though. This paper focuses on one particular challenge: content moderation, e.g. the need to remove spam or hate speech. While centralized platforms like Facebook and Twitter rely on automated tools for moderation, their dependence on massive labeled datasets and specialized infrastructure renders them impractical for decentralized, low-resource settings like the Fediverse. In this work, we design and evaluate FedMod, a collaborative content moderation system based on federated learning. Our system enables servers to exchange parameters of partially trained local content moderation models with similar servers, creating a federated model shared among collaborating servers. FedMod demonstrates robust performance on three different content moderation tasks: harmful content detection, bot content detection, and content warning assignment, achieving average per-server macro-F1 scores of 0.71, 0.73, and 0.58, respectively."
2501.05927,"We examine how social media users from eight European Union (EU) member states express their socio-political identities, focusing on users' online self-presentation and group identity cues conveyed through bios. Our goal is to explore commonalities and differences in topics discussed in social media profiles, across Left-and Right-wing user groups, within and across EU countries. Through a novel approach we map how identity-related discourse varies by country and political orientation, revealing how group identity is expressed within the EU. We find that topics related to democracy, national way of life, and decentralization emerge as particularly divisive, showing considerable variation both within and between EU countries. A subset of topics, which includes education, environmentalism, sustainability, equality, freedom & human rights, and traditional morality, among others, clearly differentiate Left-from Right-leaning user groups. These partisan topics are relevant as they could be leveraged for mobilizing ideological groups and highlight Left-Right identitarian differences at the EU level. Finally, we show that our Left-Right identity similarity metrics reflect aspects of real-world political fragmentation, which are closely aligned to the perceptions of political conflict intensity by country, as measured by the 2022 PEW survey."
2501.06721,"Link prediction is a fundamental problem in graph theory with diverse applications, including recommender systems, community detection, and identifying spurious connections. While feature-based methods achieve high accuracy, their reliance on node attributes limits their applicability in featureless graphs. For such graphs, structure-based approaches, including common neighbor-based and degree-dependent methods, are commonly employed. However, the effectiveness of these methods depends on graph density, with common neighbor-based algorithms performing well in dense graphs and degree-dependent methods being more suitable for sparse or tree-like graphs. Despite this, the literature lacks a clear criterion to distinguish between dense and sparse graphs. This paper introduces the average clustering coefficient as a criterion for assessing graph density to assist with the choice of link prediction algorithms. To address the scarcity of datasets for empirical analysis, we propose a novel graph generation method based on the Barabasi-Albert model, which enables controlled variation of graph density while preserving structural heterogeneity. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we establish an empirical boundary for the average clustering coefficient that facilitates the selection of effective link prediction techniques."
2501.07182,"TikTok has gradually become one of the most pervasive social media platforms in our daily lives. While much can be said about the merits of platforms such as TikTok, there is a different kind of attention paid towards the political affect of social media today compared to its impact on other aspects of modern networked reality. I explored how users on TikTok discussed the crisis in Palestine that worsened in 2023. Using network analysis, I situate keywords representing the conflict and categorize them thematically based on a coding schema derived from politically and ideologically differentiable stances. I conclude that activism and propaganda are contending amongst themselves in the thriving space afforded by TikTok today."
2501.07327,"The advantages of temporal networks in capturing complex dynamics, such as diffusion and contagion, has led to breakthroughs in real world systems across numerous fields. In the case of human behavior, face-to-face interaction networks enable us to understand the dynamics of how communities emerge and evolve in time through the interactions, which is crucial in fields like epidemics, sociological studies and urban science. However, state-of-the-art datasets suffer from a number of drawbacks, such as short time-span for data collection and a small number of participants. Moreover, concerns arise for the participants' privacy and the data collection costs. Over the past years, many successful algorithms for static networks generation have been proposed, but they often do not tackle the social structure of interactions or their temporal aspect. In this work, we extend a recent network generation approach to capture the evolution of interactions between different communities. Our method labels nodes based on their community affiliation and constructs surrogate networks that reflect the interactions of the original temporal networks between nodes with different labels. This enables the generation of synthetic networks that replicate realistic behaviors. We validate our approach by comparing structural measures between the original and generated networks across multiple face-to-face interaction datasets."
2501.07368,"Social media play a key role in mobilizing collective action, holding the potential for studying the pathways that lead individuals to actively engage in addressing global challenges. However, quantitative research in this area has been limited by the absence of granular and large-scale ground truth about the level of participation in collective action among individual social media users. To address this limitation, we present a novel suite of text classifiers designed to identify expressions of participation in collective action from social media posts, in a topic-agnostic fashion. Grounded in the theoretical framework of social movement mobilization, our classification captures participation and categorizes it into four levels: recognizing collective issues, engaging in calls-to-action, expressing intention of action, and reporting active involvement. We constructed a labeled training dataset of Reddit comments through crowdsourcing, which we used to train BERT classifiers and fine-tune Llama3 models. Our findings show that smaller language models can reliably detect expressions of participation (weighted F1=0.71), and rival larger models in capturing nuanced levels of participation. By applying our methodology to Reddit, we illustrate its effectiveness as a robust tool for characterizing online communities in innovative ways compared to topic modeling, stance detection, and keyword-based methods. Our framework contributes to Computational Social Science research by providing a new source of reliable annotations useful for investigating the social dynamics of collective action."
2501.07746,"The rapid expansion of social media platforms has provided unprecedented access to massive amounts of multimodal user-generated content. Comprehending user emotions can provide valuable insights for improving communication and understanding of human behaviors. Despite significant advancements in Affective Computing, the diverse factors influencing user emotions in social networks remain relatively understudied. Moreover, there is a notable lack of deep learning-based methods for predicting user emotions in social networks, which could be addressed by leveraging the extensive multimodal data available. This work presents a novel formulation of personalized emotion prediction in social networks based on heterogeneous graph learning. Building upon this formulation, we design HMG-Emo, a Heterogeneous Multimodal Graph Learning Framework that utilizes deep learning-based features for user emotion recognition. Additionally, we include a dynamic context fusion module in HMG-Emo that is capable of adaptively integrating the different modalities in social media data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of HMG-Emo and verify the superiority of adopting a graph neural network-based approach, which outperforms existing baselines that use rich hand-crafted features. To the best of our knowledge, HMG-Emo is the first multimodal and deep-learning-based approach to predict personalized emotions within online social networks. Our work highlights the significance of exploiting advanced deep learning techniques for less-explored problems in Affective Computing."
2501.0815,"In the process of enacting or introducing a new policy, policymakers frequently consider the population's responses. These considerations are critical for effective governance. There are numerous methods to gauge the ground sentiment from a subset of the population; examples include surveys or listening to various feedback channels. Many conventional approaches implicitly assume that opinions are static; however, in reality, the population will discuss and debate these new policies among themselves, and reform new opinions in the process. In this paper, we pose the following questions: Can we quantify the effect of these social dynamics on the broader opinion towards a new policy? Given some information about the relationship network that underlies the population, how does overall opinion change post-discussion? We investigate three different settings in which the policy is revealed: respondents who do not know each other, groups of respondents who all know each other, and respondents chosen randomly. By controlling who the policy is revealed to, we control the degree of discussion among the population. We quantify how these factors affect the changes in policy beliefs via the Wasserstein distance between the empirically observed data post-discussion and its distribution pre-discussion. We also provide several numerical analyses based on generated network and real-life network datasets. Our work aims to address the challenges associated with network topology and social interactions, and provide policymakers with a quantitative lens to assess policy effectiveness in the face of resource constraints and network complexities."
2501.08869,"In the quest to improve services, companies offer customers the option to interact with agents via texting. Such contact centers face unique challenges compared to traditional call centers, as measuring customer experience proxies like abandonment and patience involves uncertainty. A key source of this uncertainty is silent abandonment, where customers leave without notifying the system, wasting agent time and leaving their status unclear. Silent abandonment also obscures whether a customer was served or left. Our goals are to measure the magnitude of silent abandonment and mitigate its effects. Classification models show that 3%-70% of customers across 17 companies abandon silently. In one study, 71.3% of abandoning customers did so silently, reducing agent efficiency by 3.2% and system capacity by 15.3%, incurring $5,457 in annual costs per agent. We develop an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate customer patience under uncertainty and identify influencing covariates. We find that companies should use classification models to estimate abandonment scope and our EM algorithm to assess patience. We suggest strategies to operationally mitigate the impact of silent abandonment by predicting suspected silent-abandonment behavior or changing service design. Specifically, we show that while allowing customers to write while waiting in the queue creates a missing data challenge, it also significantly increases patience and reduces service time, leading to reduced abandonment and lower staffing requirements."
2501.09026,"Criminals are using every means available to launder the profits from their illegal activities into ostensibly legitimate assets. Meanwhile, most commercial anti-money laundering systems are still rule-based, which cannot adapt to the ever-changing tricks. Although some machine learning methods have been proposed, they are mainly focused on the perspective of abnormal behavior for single accounts. Considering money laundering activities are often involved in gang criminals, these methods are still not intelligent enough to crack down on criminal gangs all-sidedly. In this paper, a systematic solution is presented to find suspicious money laundering gangs. A temporal-directed Louvain algorithm has been proposed to detect communities according to relevant anti-money laundering patterns. All processes are implemented and optimized on Spark platform. This solution can greatly improve the efficiency of anti-money laundering work for financial regulation agencies."
2501.09027,"Twitter has become a pivotal platform for conducting information operations (IOs), particularly during high-stakes political events. In this study, we analyze over a million tweets about the 2024 U.S. presidential election to explore an under-studied area: the behavioral differences of IO drivers from English- and Spanish-speaking communities. Using similarity graphs constructed from behavioral patterns, we identify IO drivers in both languages and evaluate the clustering quality of these graphs in an unsupervised setting. Our analysis demonstrates how different network dismantling strategies, such as node pruning and edge filtering, can impact clustering quality and the identification of coordinated IO drivers. We also reveal significant differences in the topics and political indicators between English and Spanish IO drivers. Additionally, we investigate bilingual users who post in both languages, systematically uncovering their distinct roles and behaviors compared to monolingual users. These findings underscore the importance of robust, culturally and linguistically adaptable IO detection methods to mitigate the risks of influence campaigns on social media. Our code and data are available on GitHub:this https URL."
2501.09028,"In the field of telecommunications, various operations are driven by different physical quantities. Each has its own patterns in time and space, but all show some clustered structures in their spatial distribution. This reflects a unified rule of human mobility, suggesting the consistency among different telecommunication regionalization objectives. With this in mind, regionalization can be used to identify these patterns and can be applied to improve management efficiency in the context of ""autonomous networks"". This article introduces the ""Traffic Autonomous Zone (TAZ)"" concept. This approach aims to create a reasonable unified regionalization scheme by identifying spatial clusters. It is not just a practical way to partition cities based on telecommunications needs, but it also captures self-organization structure of cities in essence. We present examples of this regionalization method using real data. Compared to the popular Louvain community detection method, our approach is on the Pareto frontier, allowing for a balance among various metrics in telecommunications."
2501.09035,"Social media play a pivotal role in disseminating web content, particularly during elections, yet our understanding of the association between demographic factors and information sharing online remains limited. Here, we introduce a unique dataset, DomainDemo, linking domains shared on Twitter (X) with the demographic characteristics of associated users, including age, gender, race, political affiliation, and geolocation, from 2011 to 2022. This new resource was derived from a panel of over 1.5 million Twitter users matched against their U.S. voter registration records, facilitating a better understanding of a decade of information flows on one of the most prominent social media platforms and trends in political and public discourse among registered U.S. voters from different sociodemographic groups. By aggregating user demographic information onto the domains, we derive five metrics that provide critical insights into over 129,000 websites. In particular, the localness and partisan audience metrics quantify the domains' geographical reach and ideological orientation, respectively. These metrics show substantial agreement with existing classifications, suggesting the effectiveness and reliability of DomainDemo's approach."
2501.09102,"Understanding how misleading and outright false information enters news ecosystems remains a difficult challenge that requires tracking how narratives spread across thousands of fringe and mainstream news websites. To do this, we introduce a system that utilizes encoder-based large language models and zero-shot stance detection to scalably identify and track news narratives and their attitudes across over 4,000 factually unreliable, mixed-reliability, and factually reliable English-language news websites. Running our system over an 18 month period, we track the spread of 146K news stories. Using network-based interference via the NETINF algorithm, we show that the paths of news narratives and the stances of websites toward particular entities can be used to uncover slanted propaganda networks (e.g., anti-vaccine and anti-Ukraine) and to identify the most influential websites in spreading these attitudes in the broader news ecosystem. We hope that increased visibility into our distributed news ecosystem can help with the reporting and fact-checking of propaganda and disinformation."
2501.09856,"In this paper, we extend the classical Color Refinement algorithm for static networks to temporal (undirected and directed) networks. This enables us to design an algorithm to sample synthetic networks that preserves the $d$-hop neighborhood structure of a given temporal network. The higher $d$ is chosen, the better the temporal neighborhood structure of the original network is preserved. Specifically, we provide efficient algorithms that preserve time-respecting (""causal"") paths in the networks up to length $d$, and scale to real-world network sizes. We validate our approach theoretically (for Degree and Katz centrality) and experimentally (for edge persistence, causal triangles, and burstiness). An experimental comparison shows that our method retains these key temporal characteristics more effectively than existing randomization methods."
2501.09909,"We present an interactive visualization of the Cell Map for AI Talent Knowledge Graph (CM4AI TKG), a detailed semantic space comprising approximately 28,000 experts and 1,000 datasets focused on the biomedical field. Our tool leverages transformer-based embeddings, WebGL visualization techniques, and generative AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface. This visualization supports the exploration of around 29,000 nodes, assisting users in identifying potential collaborators and dataset users within the health and biomedical research fields. Our solution transcends the limitations of conventional graph visualization tools like Gephi, particularly in handling large-scale interactive graphs. We utilize GPT-4o to furnish detailed justifications for recommended collaborators and dataset users, promoting informed decision-making. Key functionalities include responsive search and exploration, as well as GenAI-driven recommendations, all contributing to a nuanced representation of the convergence between biomedical and AI research landscapes. In addition to benefiting the Bridge2AI and CM4AI communities, this adaptable visualization framework can be extended to other biomedical knowledge graphs, fostering advancements in medical AI and healthcare innovation through improved user interaction and data exploration.

2501.0995,"On July 13, 2024, at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania, someone attempted to assassinate Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump. This attempt sparked a large-scale discussion on social media. We collected posts from X (formerly known as Twitter) one week before and after the assassination attempt and aimed to model the short-term effects of such a ``shock'' on public opinions and discussion topics. Specifically, our study addresses three key questions: first, we investigate how public sentiment toward Donald Trump shifts over time and across regions (RQ1) and examine whether the assassination attempt itself significantly affects public attitudes, independent of the existing political alignments (RQ2). Finally, we explore the major themes in online conversations before and after the crisis, illustrating how discussion topics evolved in response to this politically charged event (RQ3). By integrating large language model-based sentiment analysis, difference-in-differences modeling, and topic modeling techniques, we find that following the attempt the public response was broadly sympathetic to Trump rather than polarizing, despite baseline ideological and regional disparities."
2501.10557,"Bluesky has recently emerged as a lively competitor to Twitter/X for a platform for public discourse and news sharing. Most of the research on Bluesky so far has focused on characterizing its adoption due to migration. There has been less interest on characterizing the properties of Bluesky as a platform for news sharing and discussion, and in particular the prevalence of unreliable information on it. To fill this gap, this research provides the first comprehensive analysis of news reliability on Bluesky. We introduce MurkySky, a public tool to track the prevalence of content from unreliable news sources on Bluesky. Using firehose data from the summer of 2024, we find that on Bluesky reliable-source news content is prevalent, and largely originating from left-leaning sources. Content from unreliable news sources, while accounting for a small fraction of all news-linking posts, tends to originate from more partisan sources, but largely reflects the left-leaning skew of the platform. Analysis of the language and hashtags used in news-linking posts shows that unreliable-source content concentrates on specific topics of discussion."
2501.1094,"Workers recruitment remains a significant issue in Mobile Crowdsourcing (MCS), where the aim is to recruit a group of workers that maximizes the expected Quality of Service (QoS). Current recruitment systems assume that a pre-defined pool of workers is available. However, this assumption is not always true, especially in cold-start situations, where a new MCS task has just been released. Additionally, studies show that up to 96\% of the available candidates are usually not willing to perform the assigned tasks. To tackle these issues, recent works use Online Social Networks (OSNs) and Influence Maximization (IM) to advertise about the desired MCS tasks through influencers, aiming to build larger pools. However, these works suffer from several limitations, such as 1) the lack of group-based selection methods when choosing influencers, 2) the lack of a well-defined worker recruitment process following IM, 3) and the non-dynamicity of the recruitment process, where the workers who refuse to perform the task are not substituted. In this paper, an Influence- and Interest-based Worker Recruitment System (IIWRS), using OSNs, is proposed. The proposed system has two main components: 1) an MCS-, group-, and interest-based IM approach, using a Genetic Algorithm, to select a set of influencers from the network to advertise about the MCS tasks, and 2) a dynamic worker recruitment process which considers the social attributes of workers, and is able to substitute those who do not accept to perform the assigned tasks. Empirical studies are performed using real-life datasets, while comparing IIWRS with existing benchmarks."
2501.11024,"Networks significantly influence social, economic, and organizational outcomes, with centrality measures serving as crucial tools to capture the importance of individual nodes. This paper introduces Laplacian Eigenvector Centrality (LEC), a novel framework for network analysis based on spectral graph theory and the eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix. A distinctive feature of LEC is its adjustable parameter, the LEC order, which enables researchers to control and assess the scope of centrality measurement using the Laplacian spectrum. Using random graph models, LEC demonstrates robustness and scalability across diverse network structures. We connect LEC to equilibrium responses to external shocks in an economic model, showing how LEC quantifies agents' roles in attenuating shocks and facilitating coordinated responses through quadratic optimization. Finally, we apply LEC to the study of microfinance diffusion, illustrating how it complements classical centrality measures, such as eigenvector and Katz-Bonacich centralities, by capturing distinctive aspects of node positions within the network."
2501.11084,"This paper combines two significant areas of political science research: measuring individual ideological position and cohesion. Although both approaches help analyze legislative behaviors, no unified model currently integrates these dimensions. To fill this gap, the paper proposes a methodology called B-Call that combines ideological positioning with voting cohesion, treating votes as random variables. The model is empirically validated using roll-call data from the United States, Brazil, and Chile legislatures, which represent diverse legislative dynamics. The analysis aims to capture the complexities of voting and legislative behaviors, resulting in a two-dimensional indicator. This study addresses gaps in current legislative voting models, particularly in contexts with limited party control."
2501.11165,"The ability to detect coordinated activity in communication networks is an ongoing challenge. Prior approaches emphasize considering any activity exceeding a specific threshold of similarity to be coordinated. However, identifying such a threshold is often arbitrary and can be difficult to distinguish from grassroots organized behavior. In this paper, we investigate a set of Twitter retweeting data collected around the 2022 US midterm elections, using a latent sharing-space model, in which we identify the main components of an association network, thresholded with a k-nearest neighbor criterion. This approach identifies a distribution of association values with different roles in the network at different ranges, where the shape of the distribution suggests a natural place to threshold for coordinated user candidates. We find coordination candidates belonging to two broad categories, one involving music awards and promotion of Korean pop or Taylor Swift, the other being users engaged in political mobilization. In addition, the latent space suggests common motivations for different coordinated groups otherwise fragmented by using an appropriately high threshold criterion for coordination."
2501.11605,"Microblogging is a crucial mode of online communication. However, launching a new microblogging platform remains challenging, largely due to network effects. This has resulted in entrenched (and undesirable) dominance by established players, such as X/Twitter. To overcome these network effects, Bluesky, an emerging microblogging platform, introduced starter packs -- curated lists of accounts that users can follow with a single click. We ask if starter packs have the potential to tackle the critical problem of social bootstrapping in new online social networks? This paper is the first to address this question: we asses whether starter packs have been indeed helpful in supporting Bluesky growth. Our dataset includes $25.05 \times 10^6$ users and $335.42 \times 10^3$ starter packs with $1.73 \times 10^6$ members, covering the entire lifecycle of Bluesky. We study the usage of these starter packs, their ability to drive network and activity growth, and their potential downsides. We also quantify the benefits of starter packs for members and creators on user visibility and activity while identifying potential challenges. By evaluating starter packs' effectiveness and limitations, we contribute to the broader discourse on platform growth strategies and competitive innovation in the social media landscape."
2501.12076,"The architecture of public discourse has been profoundly reshaped by social media platforms, which mediate interactions at an unprecedented scale and complexity. This study analyzes user behavior across six platforms over 33 years, exploring how the size of conversations and communities influences dialogue dynamics. Our findings reveal that smaller platforms foster richer, more sustained interactions, while larger platforms drive broader but shorter participation. Moreover, we observe that the propensity for users to re-engage in a conversation decreases as community size grows, with niche environments as a notable exception, where participation remains robust. These findings show an interdependence between platform architecture, user engagement, and community dynamics, shedding light on how digital ecosystems shape the structure and quality of public discourse."
2501.12198,"This paper focuses on the opinion dynamics under the influence of manipulative agents. This type of agents is characterized by the fact that their opinions follow a trajectory that does not respond to the dynamics of the model, although it does influence the rest of the normal agents. Simulation has been implemented to study how one manipulative group modifies the natural dynamics of some opinion models of bounded confidence. It is studied what strategies based on the number of manipulative agents and their common opinion trajectory can be carried out by a manipulative group to influence normal agents and attract them to their opinions. In certain weighted models, some effects are observed in which normal agents move in the opposite direction to the manipulator group. Moreover, the conditions which ensure the influence of a manipulative group on a group of normal agents over time are also established for the Hegselmann-Krause model."
2501.12208,"Community discovery is one of the key issues in the study of dynamic social networks. Traditional community discovery algorithms only focus on the establishment and disconnection of connections between nodes, failing to capture deeper factors. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose a community discovery algorithm based on spatiotemporal graph embedding (CDA-SGE), which integrates spatial information and evolutions of nodes to comprehensively capture the dynamic features of networks. Specifically, this algorithm employs Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) to aggregate latent spatial information, effectively representing the embedding of nodes in space. Temporal evolutions of the nodes are then modeled using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), thereby solving problems such as node dynamism and relationship transmission. Finally, a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is applied to cluster dynamic network representations and identify community affiliations of nodes. We then perform simulations on four types of dynamic networks and show that the CDA-SGE outperforms traditional community discovery algorithms in terms of purity, standardized mutual information, heterogeneity, and homogeneity. These results demonstrate the algorithm's superior ability to accurately uncover community structures hidden in dynamic social networks."
2501.12272,"Classifying the stance of individuals on controversial topics and uncovering their concerns is crucial for social scientists and policymakers. Data from Online Social Networks (OSNs), which serve as a proxy to a representative sample of society, offers an opportunity to classify these stances, discover society's concerns regarding controversial topics, and track the evolution of these concerns over time. Consequently, stance classification in OSNs has garnered significant attention from researchers. However, most existing methods for this task often rely on labelled data and utilise the text of users' posts or the interactions between users, necessitating large volumes of data, considerable processing time, and access to information that is not readily available (e.g. users' followers/followees). This paper proposes a lightweight approach for the stance classification of users and keywords in OSNs, aiming at understanding the collective opinion of individuals and their concerns. Our approach employs a tailored random walk model, requiring just one keyword representing each stance, using solely the keywords in social media posts. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to the baselines, excelling in stance classification of users and keywords, with a running time that, while not the fastest, remains competitive."
2501.12571,"In this paper, we address the challenge of discovering hidden nodes in unknown social networks, formulating three types of hidden-node discovery problems, namely, Sybil-node discovery, peripheral-node discovery, and influencer discovery. We tackle these problems by employing a graph exploration framework grounded in machine learning. Leveraging the structure of the subgraph gradually obtained from graph exploration, we construct prediction models to identify target hidden nodes in unknown social graphs. Through empirical investigations of real social graphs, we investigate the efficiency of graph exploration strategies in uncovering hidden nodes. Our results show that our graph exploration strategies discover hidden nodes with an efficiency comparable to that when the graph structure is known. Specifically, the query cost of discovering 10% of the hidden nodes is at most only 1.2 times that when the topology is known, and the query-cost multiplier for discovering 90% of the hidden nodes is at most only 1.4. Furthermore, our results suggest that using node embeddings, which are low-dimensional vector representations of nodes, for hidden-node discovery is a double-edged sword: it is effective in certain scenarios but sometimes degrades the efficiency of node discovery. Guided by this observation, we examine the effectiveness of using a bandit algorithm to combine the prediction models that use node embeddings with those that do not, and our analysis shows that the bandit-based graph exploration strategy achieves efficient node discovery across a wide array of settings."
2501.12886,"The Multi-platform Aggregated Dataset of Online Communities (MADOC) is a comprehensive dataset that facilitates computational social science research by providing FAIR-compliant standardized access to cross-platform analysis of online social dynamics. MADOC aggregates and standardizes data from Bluesky, Koo, Reddit, and Voat (2012-2024), containing 18.9 million posts, 236 million comments, and 23.1 million unique users. The dataset enables comparative studies of toxic behavior evolution across platforms through standardized interaction records and sentiment analysis. By providing UUID-anonymized user histories and temporal alignment of banned communities' activity patterns, MADOC supports research on content moderation impacts and platform migration trends. Distributed via Zenodo with persistent identifiers and Python/R toolkits, the dataset adheres to FAIR principles while addressing post-API-era research challenges through ethical aggregation of public social media archives."
2501.12946,"Community detection is crucial in data mining. Traditional methods primarily focus on graph structure, often neglecting the significance of attribute features. In contrast, deep learning-based approaches incorporate attribute features and local structural information through contrastive learning, improving detection performance. However, existing algorithms' complex design and joint optimization make them difficult to train and reduce detection efficiency. Additionally, these methods require the number of communities to be predefined, making the results susceptible to artificial interference. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective community detection algorithm that can adaptively detect communities without relying on data augmentation and contrastive optimization. The proposed algorithm first performs community pre-detection to extract global structural information adaptively. It then utilizes GCN to integrate local structures and attribute features. Subsequently, it combines global, local structures and attribute features in the feature space to discover community affiliations. Finally, a modularity maximization method is employed to optimize the communities based on these three types of information, thereby uncovering the community affiliation of each node. We conduct experimental comparisons across various graph datasets, evaluating the proposed algorithm against traditional methods and state-of-the-art community detection algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves greater efficiency and accuracy in terms of both detection speed and effectiveness. The code is available atthis https URL."
2501.13014,"Traditional closed peer review systems, which have played a central role in scientific publishing, are often slow, costly, non-transparent, stochastic, and possibly subject to biases - factors that can impede scientific progress and undermine public trust. Here, we propose and examine the efficacy and accuracy of an alternative form of scientific peer review: through an open, bottom-up process. First, using data from two major scientific conferences (CCN2023 and ICLR2023), we highlight how high variability of review scores and low correlation across reviewers presents a challenge for collective review. We quantify reviewer agreement with community consensus scores and use this as a reviewer quality estimator, showing that surprisingly, reviewer quality scores are not correlated with authorship quality. Instead, we reveal an inverted U-shape relationship, where authors with intermediate paper scores are the best reviewers. We assess empirical Bayesian methods to estimate paper quality based on different assessments of individual reviewer reliability. We show how under a one-shot review-then-score scenario, both in our models and on real peer review data, a Bayesian measure significantly improves paper quality assessments relative to simple averaging. We then consider an ongoing model of publishing, reviewing, and scoring, with reviewers scoring not only papers but also other reviewers. We show that user-generated reviewer ratings can yield robust and high-quality paper scoring even when unreliable (but unbiased) reviewers dominate. Finally, we outline incentive structures to recognize high-quality reviewers and encourage broader reviewing coverage of submitted papers. These findings suggest that a self-selecting open peer review process is potentially scalable, reliable, and equitable with the possibility of enhancing the speed, fairness, and transparency of the peer review process."
2501.13061,"The participation of women in academia has increased in the last few decades across many fields (e.g., Computer Science, History, Medicine). However, this increase in the participation of women has not been the same at all career stages. Here, we study how gender participation within different fields is related to gender representation in top-ranking positions in productivity (number of papers), research impact (number of citations), and co-authorship networks (degree of connectivity). We analyzed over 80 million papers published from 1975 to 2020 in 19 academic fields. Our findings reveal that women remain a minority in all 19 fields, with physics, geology, and mathematics having the lowest percentage of papers authored by women at 14% and psychology having the largest percentage at 39%. Women are significantly underrepresented in top-ranking positions (top 10% or higher) across all fields and metrics (productivity, citations, and degree), indicating that it remains challenging for early researchers (especially women) to reach top-ranking positions, as our results reveal the rankings to be rigid over time. Finally, we show that in most fields, women and men with comparable productivity levels and career age tend to attain different levels of citations, where women tend to benefit more from co-authorships, while men tend to benefit more from productivity, especially in pSTEMs. Our findings highlight that while the participation of women has risen in some fields, they remain under-represented in top-ranking positions. Greater gender participation at entry levels often helps representation, but stronger interventions are still needed to achieve long-lasting careers for women and their participation in top-ranking positions."
2501.13215,"Models of opinion dynamics describe how opinions are shaped in various environments. While these models are able to replicate general opinion distributions observed in real-world scenarios, their capacity to align with data at the user level remains mostly untested. We evaluate the capacity of the multi-state voter model with zealots to capture individual opinions in a fine-grained Twitter dataset collected during the 2017 French Presidential elections. Our findings reveal a strong correspondence between individual opinion distributions in the equilibrium state of the model and ground-truth political leanings of the users. Additionally, we demonstrate that discord probabilities accurately identify pairs of like-minded users. These results emphasize the validity of the voter model in complex settings, and advocate for further empirical evaluations of opinion dynamics models at the user level."
2501.13561,"Existing methods for assessing the trustworthiness of news publishers face high costs and scalability issues. The tool presented in this paper supports the efforts of specialized organizations by providing a solution that, starting from an online discussion, provides (i) trustworthiness ratings for previously unclassified news publishers and (ii) an interactive platform to guide annotation efforts and improve the robustness of the ratings. The system implements a novel framework for assessing the trustworthiness of online news publishers based on user interactions on social media platforms."
2501.14011,"A taxonomy is a hierarchical graph containing knowledge to provide valuable insights for various web applications. Online retail organizations like Microsoft and Amazon utilize taxonomies to improve product recommendations and optimize advertisement by enhancing query interpretation. However, the manual construction of taxonomies requires significant human effort. As web content continues to expand at an unprecedented pace, existing taxonomies risk becoming outdated, struggling to incorporate new and emerging information effectively. As a consequence, there is a growing need for dynamic taxonomy expansion to keep them relevant and up-to-date. Existing taxonomy expansion methods often rely on classical word embeddings to represent entities. However, these embeddings fall short in capturing hierarchical polysemy, where an entity's meaning can vary based on its position in the hierarchy and its surrounding context. To address this challenge, we introduce QuanTaxo, an innovative quantum-inspired framework for taxonomy expansion. QuanTaxo encodes entity representations in quantum space, effectively modeling hierarchical polysemy by leveraging the principles of Hilbert space to capture interference effects between entities, yielding richer and more nuanced representations. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets show that QuanTaxo significantly outperforms classical embedding models, achieving substantial improvements of 18.45% in accuracy, 20.5% in Mean Reciprocal Rank, and 17.87% in Wu & Palmer metrics across eight classical embedding-based baselines. We further highlight the superiority of QuanTaxo through extensive ablation and case studies."
2501.14163,"Rules are a critical component of the functioning of nearly every online community, yet it is challenging for community moderators to make data-driven decisions about what rules to set for their communities. The connection between a community's rules and how its membership feels about its governance is not well understood. In this work, we conduct the largest-to-date analysis of rules on Reddit, collecting a set of 67,545 unique rules across 5,225 communities which collectively account for more than 67% of all content on Reddit. More than just a point-in-time study, our work measures how communities change their rules over a 5+ year period. We develop a method to classify these rules using a taxonomy of 17 key attributes extended from previous work. We assess what types of rules are most prevalent, how rules are phrased, and how they vary across communities of different types. Using a dataset of communities' discussions about their governance, we are the first to identify the rules most strongly associated with positive community perceptions of governance: rules addressing who participates, how content is formatted and tagged, and rules about commercial activities. We conduct a longitudinal study to quantify the impact of adding new rules to communities, finding that after a rule is added, community perceptions of governance immediately improve, yet this effect diminishes after six months. Our results have important implications for platforms, moderators, and researchers. We make our classification model and rules datasets public to support future research on this topic."
2501.146,"Homophily, the tendency of similar nodes to connect, is a fundamental phenomenon in network science and a critical factor in the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs). While existing studies primarily explore homophily in homogeneous graphs, where nodes share the same type, real-world networks are often more accurately modeled as heterogeneous graphs (HGs) with diverse node types and intricate cross-type interactions. This structural diversity complicates the analysis of homophily, as traditional homophily metrics fail to account for distinct label spaces across node types. To address this limitation, we introduce the Cross-Type Homophily Ratio, a novel metric that quantifies homophily based on the similarity of target information across different node types. Furthermore, we introduce Cross-Type Homophily-guided Heterogeneous Graph Pruning, a method designed to selectively remove low-homophily crosstype edges, thereby enhancing the Cross-Type Homophily Ratio and boosting the performance of heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). Extensive experiments on five real-world HG datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, which delivers up to 13.36% average relative performance improvement for HGNNs, offering a fresh perspective on cross-type homophily in heterogeneous graph learning."
2501.1483,"This paper considers the problem of label recovery in random graphs and matrices. Motivated by transitive behavior in real-world networks (i.e., ``the friend of my friend is my friend''), a recent line of work considers spatially-embedded networks, which exhibit transitive behavior. In particular, the Geometric Hidden Community Model (GHCM), introduced by Gaudio, Guan, Niu, and Wei, models a network as a labeled Poisson point process where every pair of vertices is associated with a pairwise observation whose distribution depends on the labels and positions of the vertices. The GHCM is in turn a generalization of the Geometric SBM (proposed by Baccelli and Sankararaman). Gaudio et al. provided a threshold below which exact recovery is information-theoretically impossible. Above the threshold, they provided a linear-time algorithm that succeeds in exact recovery under a certain ``distinctness-of-distributions'' assumption, which they conjectured to be unnecessary. In this paper, we partially resolve the conjecture by showing that the threshold is indeed tight for the two-community GHCM. We provide a two-phase, linear-time algorithm that explores the spatial graph in a data-driven manner in Phase I to yield an almost exact labeling, which is refined to achieve exact recovery in Phase II. Our results extend achievability to geometric formulations of well-known inference problems, such as the planted dense subgraph problem and submatrix localization, in which the distinctness-of-distributions assumption does not hold."
2501.14939,"In this paper, we introduce the concept of principal communities and propose a principal graph encoder embedding method that concurrently detects these communities and achieves vertex embedding. Given a graph adjacency matrix with vertex labels, the method computes a sample community score for each community, ranking them to measure community importance and estimate a set of principal communities. The method then produces a vertex embedding by retaining only the dimensions corresponding to these principal communities. Theoretically, we define the population version of the encoder embedding and the community score based on a random Bernoulli graph distribution. We prove that the population principal graph encoder embedding preserves the conditional density of the vertex labels and that the population community score successfully distinguishes the principal communities. We conduct a variety of simulations to demonstrate the finite-sample accuracy in detecting ground-truth principal communities, as well as the advantages in embedding visualization and subsequent vertex classification. The method is further applied to a set of real-world graphs, showcasing its numerical advantages, including robustness to label noise and computational scalability."
2501.15048,"Personalized recommendation algorithms, like those on YouTube, significantly shape online content consumption. These systems aim to maximize engagement by learning users' preferences and aligning content accordingly but may unintentionally reinforce impulsive and emotional biases. Using a sock-puppet audit methodology, this study examines YouTube's capacity to recognize and reinforce emotional preferences. Simulated user accounts with assigned emotional preferences navigate the platform, selecting videos that align with their assigned preferences and recording subsequent recommendations. Our findings reveal reveal that YouTube amplifies negative emotions, such as anger and grievance, by increasing their prevalence and prominence in recommendations. This reinforcement intensifies over time and persists across contexts. Surprisingly, contextual recommendations often exceed personalized ones in reinforcing emotional alignment. These findings suggest the algorithm amplifies user biases, contributing to emotional filter bubbles and raising concerns about user well-being and societal impacts. The study emphasizes the need for balancing personalization with content diversity and user agency."
2501.1513,"Community detection is a critical task in graph theory, social network analysis, and bioinformatics, where communities are defined as clusters of densely interconnected nodes. However, detecting communities in large-scale networks with millions of nodes and billions of edges remains challenging due to the inefficiency and unreliability of existing methods. Moreover, many current approaches are limited to specific graph types, such as unweighted or undirected graphs, reducing their broader applicability. To address these issues, we propose a novel heuristic community detection algorithm, termed CoDeSEG, which identifies communities by minimizing the two-dimensional (2D) structural entropy of the network within a potential game framework. In the game, nodes decide to stay in current community or move to another based on a strategy that maximizes the 2D structural entropy utility function. Additionally, we introduce a structural entropy-based node overlapping heuristic for detecting overlapping communities, with a near-linear timethis http URLresults on real-world networks demonstrate that CoDeSEG is the fastest method available and achieves state-of-the-art performance in overlapping normalized mutual information (ONMI) and F1 score."
2501.15539,"Opaque algorithms disseminate and mediate the content that users consume on online social media platforms. This algorithmic mediation serves users with contents of their liking, on the other hand, it may cause several inadvertent risks to society at scale. While some of these risks, e.g., filter bubbles or dissemination of hateful content, are well studied in the community, behavioral addiction, designated by the Digital Services Act (DSA) as a potential systemic risk, has been understudied. In this work, we aim to study if one can effectively diagnose behavioral addiction using digital data traces from social media platforms. Focusing on the TikTok short-format video platform as a case study, we employ a novel mixed methodology of combining survey responses with data donations of behavioral traces. We survey 1590 TikTok users and stratify them into three addiction groups (i.e., less/moderately/highly likely addicted). Then, we obtain data donations from 107 surveyed participants. By analyzing users' data we find that, among others, highly likely addicted users spend more time watching TikTok videos and keep coming back to TikTok throughout the day, indicating a compulsion to use the platform. Finally, by using basic user engagement features, we train classifier models to identify highly likely addicted users with $F_1 \geq 0.55$. The performance of the classifier models suggests predicting addictive users solely based on their usage is rather difficult."
2501.15713,"Shared micro-mobility such as e-scooters has gained significant popularity in many cities. However, existing methods for detecting community structures in mobility networks often overlook potential overlaps between communities. In this study, we conceptualize shared micro-mobility in urban spaces as a process of information exchange, where locations are connected through e-scooters, facilitating the interaction and propagation of community affiliations. As a result, similar locations are assigned the same label. Based on this concept, we developed a Geospatial Interaction Propagation model (GIP) by designing a Speaker-Listener Label Propagation Algorithm (SLPA) that accounts for geographic distance decay, incorporating anomaly detection to ensure the derived community structures reflect meaningful spatial patterns. We applied this model to detect overlapping communities within the e-scooter system in Washington, D.C. The results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing model of overlapping community detection in both efficiency and modularity.

High passenger density and close physical proximity has been shown to accelerate the spread of infectious diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many public transportation companies took measures to slow down and minimize disease spreading. One of these measures was introducing spacing and capacity constraints to public transit vehicles. Our objective is to explore the effects of demand changes and transportation measures from an epidemiological point of view, offering alternative measures to public transportation companies to keep the system alive while minimizing the epidemiological risk as much as possible."
2501.16076,"The bulk of the literature on opinion optimization in social networks adopts the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model, in which the innate opinions of all nodes are known: this is an unrealistic assumption. In this paper, we study opinion optimization under the FJ model without the full knowledge of innate opinions. Specifically, we borrow from the literature a series of objective functions, aimed at minimizing polarization and/or disagreement, and we tackle the budgeted optimization problem, where we can query the innate opinions of only a limited number of nodes. Given the complexity of our problem, we propose a framework based on three steps: (1) select the limited number of nodes we query, (2) reconstruct the innate opinions of all nodes based on those queried, and (3) optimize the objective function with the reconstructed opinions. For each step of the framework, we present and systematically evaluate several effective strategies. A key contribution of our work is a rigorous error propagation analysis that quantifies how reconstruction errors in innate opinions impact the quality of the final solutions. Our experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets show that we can effectively minimize polarization and disagreement even if we have quite limited information about innate opinions."

While studies have investigated the contents of posts made to popular parental subreddits revealing the family health concerns being expressed, little is known about parents' posting patterns or other issues they engage in. In this study, we explore the posting activity of users of 55 parental subreddits. Exploring posts made by these users (667K) across Reddit (34M posts) reveals that over 85% of posters are not one-time users of Reddit and actively engage with the community. Studying cross-posting patterns also reveals the use of subreddits dedicated to other topics such as relationship and health advice (e.g., r/AskDocs, r/relationship_advice) by this population. As a result, for a comprehensive understanding of the type of information posters share and seek, future work should investigate sub-communities outside of parental-specific ones. Finally, we expand the list of parental subreddits, compiling a total of 115 subreddits that could be utilized in future studies of parental concerns."
2501.1621,"Despite extensive research and development of tools and technologies for misinformation tracking and detection, we often find ourselves largely on the losing side of the battle against misinformation. In an era where misinformation poses a substantial threat to public discourse, trust in information sources, and societal and political stability, it is imperative that we regularly revisit and reorient our work strategies. While we have made significant strides in understanding how and why misinformation spreads, we must now broaden our focus and explore how technology can help realise new approaches to address this complex challenge more efficiently."
2501.16624,"We investigate the problem of sybil (fake account) detection in social networks from a graph algorithms perspective, where graph structural information is used to classify users as sybil and benign. We introduce the novel notion of user resistance to attack requests (friendship requests from sybil accounts). Building on this notion, we propose a synthetic graph data generation framework that supports various attack strategies. We then study the optimization problem where we are allowed to reveal the resistance of a subset of users with the aim to maximize the number of users which are discovered to be benign and the number of potential attack edges (connections from a sybil to a benign user). Furthermore, we devise efficient algorithms for this problem and investigate their theoretical guarantees. Finally, through a large set of experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithms improve detection performance notably when applied as a preprocessing step for different sybil detection algorithms. The code and data used in this work are publicly available on GitHubthis https URL"
2501.16668,"As radical messaging has proliferated on social networking sites, platforms like Reddit have been used to host support groups, including support communities for the families and friends of radicalized individuals. This study examines the subreddit r/QAnonCasualties, an online forum for users whose loved ones have been radicalized by QAnon. We collected 1,665 posts and 78,171 comments posted between 7/2021 and 7/2022 and content coded top posts for prominent themes. Sentiment analysis was also conducted on all posts. We find venting, advice and validation-seeking, and pressure to refuse the COVID-19 vaccine were prominent themes. 40% (n=167) of coded posts identified the Q relation(s) of users as their parent(s) and 16.3% (n=68) as their partner. Posts with higher proportions of words related to swearing, social referents, and physical needs were positively correlated with engagement. These findings show ways that communities around QAnon adherents leverage anonymous online spaces to seek and provide social support."
2501.1683,"Nowadays, Social Networks have become an essential communication tools producing a large amount of information about their users and their interactions, which can be analysed with Data Mining methods. In the last years, Social Networks are being used to radicalise people. In this paper, we study the performance of a set of indicators and their respective metrics, devoted to assess the risk of radicalisation of a precise individual on three different datasets. Keyword-based metrics, even though depending on the written language, performs well when measuring frustration, perception of discrimination as well as declaration of negative and positive ideas about Western society and Jihadism, respectively. However, metrics based on frequent habits such as writing ellipses are not well enough to characterise a user in risk of radicalisation. The paper presents a detailed description of both, the set of indicators used to asses the radicalisation in Social Networks and the set of datasets used to evaluate them. Finally, an experimental study over these datasets are carried out to evaluate the performance of the metrics considered."
2501.1772,"Temporal networks are characterised by interdependent link events between nodes, forming ordered sequences of links that may represent specific information flows in the system. Nevertheless, representing temporal networks using discrete snapshots in time partially cancels the effect of time-ordered links on each other, while continuous time models, such as Poisson or Hawkes processes, can describe the full influence between all the potential pairs of links at all times. In this paper, we introduce a continuous Hawkes temporal network model which accounts both for a community structure of the aggregate network and a strong heterogeneity in the activity of individual nodes, thus accounting for the presence of highly heterogeneous clusters with isolated high-activity influencer nodes, communities and low-activity nodes. Our model improves the prediction performance of previously available continuous time network models, and obtains a systematic increase in log-likelihood. Characterising the direct interaction between influencer nodes and communities, we can provide a more detailed description of the system that can better outline the sequence of activations in the components of the systems represented by temporal networks."
2501.17817,"Community detection methods play a central role in understanding complex networks by revealing highly connected subsets of entities. However, most community detection algorithms generate partitions of the nodes, thus (i) forcing every node to be part of a community and (ii) ignoring the possibility that some nodes may be part of multiple communities. In our work, we investigate three simple community association strength (CAS) scores and their usefulness as post-processing tools given some partition of the nodes. We show that these measures can be used to improve node partitions, detect outlier nodes (not part of any community), and help find nodes with multiple community memberships."
2501.17831,"TikTok is a major force among social media platforms with over a billion monthly active users worldwide and 170 million in the United States. The platform's status as a key news source, particularly among younger demographics, raises concerns about its potential influence on politics in the U.S. and globally. Despite these concerns, there is scant research investigating TikTok's recommendation algorithm for political biases. We fill this gap by conducting 323 independent algorithmic audit experiments testing partisan content recommendations in the lead-up to the 2024 U.S. presidential elections. Specifically, we create hundreds of ""sock puppet"" TikTok accounts in Texas, New York, and Georgia, seeding them with varying partisan content and collecting algorithmic content recommendations for each of them. Collectively, these accounts viewed ~394,000 videos from April 30th to November 11th, 2024, which we label for political and partisan content. Our analysis reveals significant asymmetries in content distribution: Republican-seeded accounts received ~11.8% more party-aligned recommendations compared to their Democratic-seeded counterparts, and Democratic-seeded accounts were exposed to ~7.5% more opposite-party recommendations on average. These asymmetries exist across all three states and persist when accounting for video- and channel-level engagement metrics such as likes, views, shares, comments, and followers, and are driven primarily by negative partisanship content. Our findings provide insights into the inner workings of TikTok's recommendation algorithm during a critical election period, raising fundamental questions about platform neutrality."
2501.18531,"For rapidly spreading diseases where many cases show no symptoms, swift and effective contact tracing is essential. While exposure notification applications provide alerts on potential exposures, a fully automated system is needed to track the infectious transmission routes. To this end, our research leverages large-scale contact networks from real human mobility data to identify the path of transmission. More precisely, we introduce a new Infectious Path Centrality network metric that informs a graph learning edge classifier to identify important transmission events, achieving an F1-score of 94%. Additionally, we explore bidirectional contact tracing, which quarantines individuals both retroactively and proactively, and compare its effectiveness against traditional forward tracing, which only isolates individuals after testing positive. Our results indicate that when only 30% of symptomatic individuals are tested, bidirectional tracing can reduce infectious effective reproduction rate by 71%, thus significantly controlling the outbreak."
2501.18839,"Social Cyber Geography is the space in the digital cyber realm that is produced through social relations. Communication in the social media ecosystem happens not only because of human interactions, but is also fueled by algorithmically controlled bot agents. Most studies have not looked at the social cyber geography of bots because they focus on bot activity within a single country. Since creating a bot uses universal programming technology, bots, how prevalent are these bots throughout the world? To quantify bot activity worldwide, we perform a multilingual and geospatial analysis on a large dataset of social data collected from X during the Coronavirus pandemic in 2021. This pandemic affected most of the world, and thus is a common topic of discussion. Our dataset consists of ~100 mil posts generated by ~31mil users. Most bot studies focus only on English-speaking countries, because most bot detection algorithms are built for the English language. However, only 47\% of the bots write in the English language. To accommodate multiple languages in our bot detection algorithm, we built Multilingual BotBuster, a multi-language bot detection algorithm to identify the bots in this diverse dataset. We also create a Geographical Location Identifier to swiftly identify the countries a user affiliates with in his description. Our results show that bots can appear to move from one country to another, but the language they write in remains relatively constant. Bots distribute narratives on distinct topics related to their self-declared country affiliation. Finally, despite the diverse distribution of bot locations around the world, the proportion of bots per country is about 20%. Our work stresses the importance of a united analysis of the cyber and physical realms, where we combine both spheres to inventorize the language and location of social media bots and understand communication strategies."
2501.19016,"Infodemics are a threat to public health, arising from multiple interacting phenomena occurring both online and offline. The continuous feedback loops between the digital information ecosystem and offline contingencies make infodemics particularly challenging to define operationally, measure, and eventually model in quantitative terms. In this study, we present evidence of the effect of various epidemic-related variables on the dynamics of infodemics, using a robust modelling framework applied to data from 30 countries across diverse income groups. We use WHO COVID-19 surveillance data on new cases and deaths, vaccination data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, infodemic data (volume of public conversations and social media content) from the WHO EARS platform, and Google Trends data to represent information demand. Our findings show that new deaths are the strongest predictor of the infodemic, measured as new document production including social media content and public conversations, and that the epidemic burden in neighbouring countries appears to have a greater impact on document production than the domestic one. Building on these results, we propose a taxonomy that highlights country-specific discrepancies between the evolution of the infodemic and the epidemic. Further, an analysis of the temporal evolution of the relationship between the two phenomena quantifies how much the discussions around vaccine rollouts may have shaped the development of the infodemic. The insights from our quantitative model contribute to advancing infodemic research, highlighting the importance of a holistic approach integrating both online and offline dimensions."
2501.1922,"The Common Out-Neighbor (or CON) score quantifies shared influence through outgoing links in competitive contexts. A dynamic analysis of competition networks reveals the CON score as a powerful predictor of node rankings. Defined in first-order and second-order forms, the CON score captures both direct and indirect competitive interactions, offering a comprehensive metric for evaluating node influence. Using datasets from Survivor,this http URL, and Dota~2 online gaming competitions, directed competition networks are constructed, and the dynamic CON score is integrated into supervised machine learning models. Empirical results show that the CON score consistently outperforms traditional centrality measures such as PageRank, closeness, and betweenness centrality in classification tasks.By integrating dynamic centrality measures with machine learning, our proposed methodology accurately predicts outcomes in competition networks. The findings underline the CON score's robustness as a feature in node classification, offering a significant advancement in understanding and analyzing competitive interactions."
2502.00031,"Subgraph matching query is a fundamental problem in graph data management and has a variety of real-world applications. Several recent works utilize deep learning (DL) techniques to process subgraph matching queries. Most of them find approximate subgraph matching results without accuracy guarantees. Unlike these DL-based inexact subgraph matching methods, we propose a learning-based exact subgraph matching framework, called \textit{graph neural network (GNN)-based anchor embedding framework} (GNN-AE). In contrast to traditional exact subgraph matching methods that rely on creating auxiliary summary structures online for each specific query, our method indexes small feature subgraphs in the data graph offline and uses GNNs to perform graph isomorphism tests for these indexed feature subgraphs to efficiently obtain high-quality candidates. To make a tradeoff between query efficiency and index storage cost, we use two types of feature subgraphs, namely anchored subgraphs and anchored paths. Based on the proposed techniques, we transform the exact subgraph matching problem into a search problem in the embedding space. Furthermore, to efficiently retrieve all matches, we develop a parallel matching growth algorithm and design a cost-based DFS query planning method to further improve the matching growth algorithm. Extensive experiments on 6 real-world and 3 synthetic datasets indicate that GNN-AE is more efficient than the baselines, especially outperforming the exploration-based baseline methods by up to 1--2 orders of magnitude."
2502.00038,"The notion of barycentre graph is of crucial importance for machine learning algorithms that process graph-valued data. The barycentre graph is a ""summary graph"" that captures the mean topology and connectivity structure of a training dataset of graphs. The construction of a barycentre requires the definition of a metric to quantify distances between pairs of graphs. In this work, we use a multiscale spectral distance that is defined using the eigenvalues of the normalized graph Laplacian. The eigenvalues -- but not the eigenvectors -- of the normalized Laplacian of the barycentre graph can be determined from the optimization problem that defines the barycentre. In this work, we propose a structural constraint on the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian of the barycentre graph that guarantees that the barycentre inherits the topological structure of the graphs in the sample dataset. The eigenvectors can be computed using an algorithm that explores the large library of Soules bases. When the graphs are random realizations of a balanced stochastic block model, then our algorithm returns a barycentre that converges asymptotically (in the limit of large graph size) almost-surely to the population mean of the graphs. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to validate the theoretical properties of the estimator; we conduct experiments on real-life graphs that suggest that our approach works beyond the controlled environment of stochastic block models."
2502.00039,"One of the most significant challenges in combating against the spread of infectious diseases was the difficulty in estimating the true magnitude of infections. Unreported infections could drive up disease spread, making it very hard to accurately estimate the infectivity of the pathogen, therewith hampering our ability to react effectively. Despite the use of surveillance-based methods such as serological studies, identifying the true magnitude is still challenging. This paper proposes an information theoretic approach for accurately estimating the number of total infections. Our approach is built on top of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) based models, which are commonly used in epidemiology and for estimating such infections. We show how we can help such models to better compute the number of total infections and identify the parametrization by which we need the fewest bits to describe the observed dynamics of reported infections. Our experiments on COVID-19 spread show that our approach leads to not only substantially better estimates of the number of total infections but also better forecasts of infections than standard model calibration based methods. We additionally show how our learned parametrization helps in modeling more accurate what-if scenarios with non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our approach provides a general method for improving epidemic modeling which is applicable broadly."
2502.00044,"We present HoloGraphs, a novel approach for physically representing, explaining, exploring, and interacting with dynamic networks. HoloGraphs addresses the challenges of visualizing and understanding evolving network structures by providing an engaging method of interacting and exploring dynamic network structures using physicalization techniques. In contrast to traditional digital interfaces, our approach leverages tangible artifacts made from transparent materials to provide an intuitive way for people with low visualization literacy to explore network data. The process involves printing network embeddings on transparent media and assembling them to create a 3D representation of dynamic networks, maintaining spatial perception and allowing the examination of each timeslice individually. Interactivity is envisioned using optional Focus+Context layers and overlays for node trajectories and labels. Focus layers highlight nodes of interest, context layers provide an overview of the network structure, and global overlays show node trajectories over time. In this paper, we outline the design principles and implementation of HoloGraphs and present how elementary digital interactions can be mapped to physical interactions to manipulate the elements of a network and temporal dimension in an engaging matter. We demonstrate the capabilities of our concept in a case study. Using a dynamic network of character interactions from a popular book series, we showcase how it represents and supports understanding complex concepts such as dynamic networks."
2502.00055,"Given the exponential advancement in AI technologies and the potential escalation of harmful effects from recommendation systems, it is crucial to simulate and evaluate these effects early on. Doing so can help prevent possible damage to both societies and technology companies. This paper introduces the Recommender Systems LLMs Playground (RecSysLLMsP), a novel simulation framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the impacts of different content recommendation setups on user engagement and polarization in social networks. By creating diverse AI agents (AgentPrompts) with descriptive, static, and dynamic attributes, we assess their autonomous behaviour across three scenarios: Plurality, Balanced, and Similarity. Our findings reveal that the Similarity Scenario, which aligns content with user preferences, maximizes engagement while potentially fostering echo chambers. Conversely, the Plurality Scenario promotes diverse interactions but produces mixed engagement results. Our study emphasizes the need for a careful balance in recommender system designs to enhance user satisfaction while mitigating societal polarization. It underscores the unique value and challenges of incorporating LLMs into simulation environments. The benefits of RecSysLLMsP lie in its potential to calculate polarization effects, which is crucial for assessing societal impacts and determining user engagement levels with diverse recommender system setups. This advantage is essential for developing and maintaining a successful business model for social media companies. However, the study's limitations revolve around accurately emulating reality. Future efforts should validate the similarity in behaviour between real humans and AgentPrompts and establish metrics for measuring polarization scores."
2502.00058,"Analyzing social networks formed by developers provides valuable insights for market segmentation, trend analysis, and community engagement. In this study, we explore the GitHub Stargazers dataset to classify developer communities and predict potential collaborations using graph neural networks (GNNs). By modeling 12,725 developer networks, we segment communities based on their focus on web development or machine learning repositories, leveraging graph attributes and node embeddings. Furthermore, we propose an edge-level recommendation algorithm that predicts new connections between developers using similarity measures. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately segmenting communities and improving connection predictions, offering valuable insights for understanding open-source developer networks."
2502.0006,"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict started on 7 October 2023, have resulted thus far to over 48,000 people killed including more than 17,000 children with a majority from Gaza, more than 30,000 people injured, over 10,000 missing, and over 1 million people displaced, fleeing conflict zones. The infrastructure damage includes the 87\% of housing units, 80\% of public buildings and 60\% of cropland 17 out of 36 hospitals, 68\% of road networks and 87\% of school buildings damaged. This conflict has as well launched an online discussion across various social media platforms. Telegram was no exception due to its encrypted communication and highly involved audience. The current study will cover an analysis of the related discussion in relation to different participants of the conflict and sentiment represented in those discussion. To this end, we prepared a dataset of 125K messages shared on channels in Telegram spanning from 23 October 2025 until today. Additionally, we apply the same analysis in two publicly available datasets from Twitter containing 2001 tweets and from Reddit containing 2M opinions. We apply a volume analysis across the three datasets, entity extraction and then proceed to BERT topic analysis in order to extract common themes or topics. Next, we apply sentiment analysis to analyze the emotional tone of the discussions. Our findings hint at polarized narratives as the hallmark of how political factions and outsiders mold public opinion. We also analyze the sentiment-topic prevalence relationship, detailing the trends that may show manipulation and attempts of propaganda by the involved parties. This will give a better understanding of the online discourse on the Israel-Palestine conflict and contribute to the knowledge on the dynamics of social media communication during geopolitical crises."
2502.00219,"As science transitions from the age of lone geniuses to an era of collaborative teams, the question of whether large teams can sustain the creativity of individuals and continue driving innovation has become increasingly important. Our previous research first revealed a negative relationship between team size and the Disruption Index-a network-based metric of innovation-by analyzing 65 million projects across papers, patents, and software over half a century. This work has sparked lively debates within the scientific community about the robustness of the Disruption Index in capturing the impact of team size on innovation. Here, we present additional evidence that the negative link between team size and disruption holds, even when accounting for factors such as reference length, citation impact, and historical time. We further show how a narrow 5-year window for measuring disruption can misrepresent this relationship as positive, underestimating the long-term disruptive potential of small teams. Like ""sleeping beauties,"" small teams need a decade or more to see their transformative contributions to science."
2502.00351,"Social event detection (SED) is a task focused on identifying specific real-world events and has broad applications across various domains. It is integral to many mobile applications with social features, including major platforms like Twitter, Weibo, and Facebook. By enabling the analysis of social events, SED provides valuable insights for businesses to understand consumer preferences and supports public services in handling emergencies and disaster management. Due to the hierarchical structure of event detection data, traditional approaches in Euclidean space often fall short in capturing the complexity of such relationships. While existing methods in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces have shown promising results, they tend to overlook multi-order relationships between events. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework, Multi-Order Hyperbolic Graph Convolution with Aggregated Attention (MOHGCAA), designed to enhance the performance of SED. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements under both supervised and unsupervised settings. To further validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework, we conducted extensive evaluations across multiple datasets, confirming its superiority in tackling common challenges in social event detection."
2502.00432,"Protecting privacy in social graphs may require obscuring nodes' membership in sensitive communities. However, doing so without significantly disrupting the underlying graph topology remains a key challenge. In this work, we address the community membership hiding problem, which involves strategically modifying the graph structure to conceal a target node's affiliation with a community, regardless of the detection algorithm used. We reformulate the original discrete, counterfactual graph search objective as a differentiable constrained optimisation task. To this end, we introduce $\nabla$-CMH, a new gradient-based method that operates within a feasible modification budget to minimise structural changes while effectively hiding a node's community membership. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and community detection methods demonstrate that our technique outperforms existing baselines, achieving the best balance between node hiding effectiveness and graph rewiring cost, while preserving computational efficiency."
2502.00627,"Discord has evolved from a gaming-focused communication tool into a versatile platform supporting diverse online communities. Despite its large user base and active public servers, academic research on Discord remains limited due to data accessibility challenges. This paper introduces Discord Unveiled: A Comprehensive Dataset of Public Communication (2015-2024), the most extensive Discord public server's data to date. The dataset comprises over 2.05 billion messages from 4.74 million users across 3,167 public servers, representing approximately 10% of servers listed in Discord's Discovery feature. Spanning from Discord's launch in 2015 to the end of 2024, it offers a robust temporal and thematic framework for analyzing decentralized moderation, community governance, information dissemination, and social dynamics. Data was collected through Discord's public API, adhering to ethical guidelines and privacy standards via anonymization techniques. Organized into structured JSON files, the dataset facilitates seamless integration with computational social science methodologies. Preliminary analyses reveal significant trends in user engagement, bot utilization, and linguistic diversity, with English predominating alongside substantial representations of Spanish, French, and Portuguese. Additionally, prevalent community themes such as social, art, music, and memes highlight Discord's expansion beyond its gaming origins."
2502.00686,"Identifying edge-dense communities that are also well-connected is an important aspect of understanding community structure. Prior work has shown that community detection methods can produce poorly connected communities, and some can even produce internally disconnected communities. In this study we evaluate the connectivity of communities obtained using Stochastic Block Models. We find that SBMs produce internally disconnected communities from real-world networks. We present a simple technique, Well-Connected Clusters (WCC), which repeatedly removes small edge cuts until the communities meet a user-specified threshold for well-connectivity. Our study using a large collection of synthetic networks based on clustered real-world networks shows that using WCC as a post-processing tool with SBM community detection typically improves clustering accuracy. WCC is fast enough to use on networks with millions of nodes and is freely available in open source form."
2502.00952,"We often treat social media as a lens onto society. How might that lens be distorting the actual popularity of political and social viewpoints? In this paper, we examine the difference between the viewpoints publicly posted in a community and the privately surveyed viewpoints of community members, contributing a measurement of a theory called the ""spiral of silence."" This theory observes that people are less likely to voice their opinion when they believe they are in the minority--leading to a spiral where minority opinions are less likely to be shared, so they appear even further in the minority, and become even less likely to be shared. We surveyed active members of politically oriented Reddit communities to gauge their willingness to post on contentious topics, yielding 627 responses from 108 participants about 11 topics and 33 subreddits. We find that 72.6% of participants who perceive themselves in the minority remain silent, and are only half as likely to post their viewpoint compared to those who believe their opinion is in the majority. Communities perceived as being more inclusive reduce the magnitude of this effect. These results emphasize how far out of step the opinions we see online may be with the population they purport to represent."
2502.0145,"With the rise of social media, misinformation has become increasingly prevalent, fueled largely by the spread of rumors. This study explores the use of Large Language Model (LLM) agents within a novel framework to simulate and analyze the dynamics of rumor propagation across social networks. To this end, we design a variety of LLM-based agent types and construct four distinct network structures to conduct these simulations. Our framework assesses the effectiveness of different network constructions and agent behaviors in influencing the spread of rumors. Our results demonstrate that the framework can simulate rumor spreading across more than one hundred agents in various networks with thousands of edges. The evaluations indicate that network structure, personas, and spreading schemes can significantly influence rumor dissemination, ranging from no spread to affecting 83\% of agents in iterations, thereby offering a realistic simulation of rumor spread in social networks."
2502.01553,"Livestreaming by VTubers -- animated 2D/3D avatars controlled by real individuals -- have recently garnered substantial global followings and achieved significant monetary success. Despite prior research highlighting the importance of realism in audience engagement, VTubers deliberately conceal their identities, cultivating dedicated fan communities through virtual personas. While previous studies underscore that building a core fan community is essential to a streamer's success, we lack an understanding of the characteristics of viewers of this new type of streamer. Gaining a deeper insight into these viewers is critical for VTubers to enhance audience engagement, foster a more robust fan base, and attract a larger viewership. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of VTuber viewers on Bilibili, a leading livestreaming platform where nearly all VTubers in China stream. By compiling a first-of-its-kind dataset covering 2.7M livestreaming sessions, we investigate the characteristics, engagement patterns, and influence of VTuber viewers. Our research yields several valuable insights, which we then leverage to develop a tool to ""recommend"" future subscribers to VTubers. By reversing the typical approach of recommending streams to viewers, this tool assists VTubers in pinpointing potential future fans to pay more attention to, and thereby effectively growing their fan community."
2502.0181,"Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are very flexible for modeling network formation but pose difficult estimation challenges due to their intractable normalizing constant. Existing methods, such as MCMC-MLE, rely on sequential simulation at every optimization step. We propose a neural network approach that trains on a single, large set of parameter-simulation pairs to learn the mapping from parameters to average network statistics. Once trained, this map can be inverted, yielding a fast and parallelizable estimation method. The procedure also accommodates extra network statistics to mitigate model misspecification. Some simple illustrative examples show that the method performs well in practice."
2502.01874,"Social influence profoundly impacts individual choices and collective behaviors in politics. In this work, driven by the goal of protecting elections from improper influence, we consider the following scenario: an individual, who has vested interests in political party $Y$, is aware through reliable surveys that parties $X$ and $Y$ are likely to get 50.1\% and 49.9\% of the vote, respectively. Could this individual employ strategies to alter public opinions and consequently invert these polling numbers in favor of party $Y$?We address this question by employing: (i) the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model, which is mathematically sophisticated and effectively captures the way individual biases and social interactions shape opinions, making it crucial for examining social influence, and (ii) interventions similar to those in Asch's experiments, which involve selecting a group of stooges within the network to spread a specific opinion. We mathematically formalize the aforementioned motivation as an optimization framework and establish that it is NP-hard and inapproximable within any constant factor. We introduce three efficient polynomial-time algorithms. The first two utilize a continuous approach: one employs gradient descent with Huber's estimator to approximate the median, and the other uses a sigmoid threshold influence function. The third utilizes a combinatorial greedy algorithm for targeted interventions. Through comparative analysis against various natural baselines and using real-world data, our results demonstrate that in numerous cases a small fraction of nodes chosen as stooges can significantly sway election outcomes under the Friedkin-Johnsen model."
2502.01905,"We explore the influence maximisation problem in networks with negative ties. Where prior work has focused on unsigned networks, we investigate the need to consider negative ties in networks while trying to maximise spread in a population - particularly under competitive conditions. Given a signed network we optimise the strategies of a focal controller, against competing influence in the network, using two approaches - either the focal controller uses a sign-agnostic approach or they factor in the sign of the edges while optimising their strategy. We compare the difference in vote-shares (or the share of population) obtained by both these methods to determine the need to navigate negative ties in these settings. More specifically, we study the impact of: (a) network topology, (b) resource conditions and (c) competitor strategies on the difference in vote shares obtained across both methodologies. We observe that gains are maximum when resources available to the focal controller are low and the competitor avoids negative edges in their strategy. Conversely, gains are insignificant irrespective of resource conditions when the competitor targets the network indiscriminately. Finally, we study the problem in a game-theoretic setting, where we simultaneously optimise the strategies of both competitors. Interestingly we observe that, strategising with the knowledge of negative ties can occasionally also lead to loss in vote-shares."
2502.02015,"People's collectively shared beliefs can have significant social implications, including on democratic processes and policies. Unfortunately, as people interact with peers to form and update their beliefs, various cognitive and social biases can hinder their collective wisdom. In this paper, we probe whether and how the psychological construct of intellectual humility can modulate collective wisdom in a networked interaction setting. Through agent-based modeling and data-calibrated simulations, we provide a proof of concept demonstrating that intellectual humility can foster more accurate estimations while mitigating polarization in social networks. We investigate the mechanisms behind the performance improvements and confirm robustness across task settings and network structures. Our work can guide intervention designs to capitalize on the promises of intellectual humility in boosting collective wisdom in social networks."
2502.02017,"Recent advances in CV and NLP have inspired researchers to develop general-purpose graph foundation models through pre-training across diverse domains. However, a fundamental challenge arises from the substantial differences in graph topologies across domains. Additionally, real-world graphs are often sparse and prone to noisy connections and adversarial attacks. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Model (MDGFM), a unified framework that aligns and leverages cross-domain topological information to facilitate robust knowledge transfer. MDGFM bridges different domains by adaptively balancing features and topology while refining original graphs to eliminate noise and align topological structures. To further enhance knowledge transfer, we introduce an efficient prompt-tuning approach. By aligning topologies, MDGFM not only improves multi-domain pre-training but also enables robust knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Theoretical analyses provide guarantees of MDGFM's effectiveness and domain generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets validate the robustness and efficacy of our method."
2502.0205,"The limited availability of useful ground-truth communities in real-world networks presents a challenge to evaluating and selecting a ""best"" community detection method for a given network or family of networks. The use of synthetic networks with planted ground-truths is one way to address this challenge. While several synthetic network generators can be used for this purpose, Stochastic Block Models (SBMs), when provided input parameters from real-world networks and clusterings, are well suited to producing networks that retain the properties of the network they are intended to model. We report, however, that SBMs can produce disconnected ground truth clusters; even under conditions where the input clusters are connected. In this study, we describe the REalistic Cluster Connectivity Simulator (RECCS), which, while retaining approximately the same quality for other network and cluster parameters, creates an SBM synthetic network and then modifies it to ensure an improved fit to cluster connectivity. We report results using parameters obtained from clustered real-world networks ranging up to 13.9 million nodes in size, and demonstrate an improvement over the unmodified use of SBMs for network generation."
2502.02365,"In complex networks, the rich-get-richer effect (nodes with high degree at one point in time gain more degree in their future) is commonly observed. In practice this is often studied on a static network snapshot, for example, a preferential attachment model assumed to explain the more highly connected nodes or a rich-club}effect that analyses the most highly connected nodes. In this paper, we consider temporal measures of how success (measured here as node degree) propagates across time. By analogy with social mobility (a measure people moving within a social hierarchy through their life) we define hierarchical mobility to measure how a node's propensity to gain degree changes over time. We introduce an associated taxonomy of temporal correlation statistics including mobility, philanthropy and community. Mobility measures the extent to which a node's degree gain in one time period predicts its degree gain in the next. Philanthropy and community measure similar properties related to node neighbourhood.We apply these statistics both to artificial models and to 26 real temporal networks. We find that most of our networks show a tendency for individual nodes and their neighbourhoods to remain in similar hierarchical positions over time, while most networks show low correlative effects between individuals and their neighbourhoods. Moreover, we show that the mobility taxonomy can discriminate between networks from different fields. We also generate artificial network models to gain intuition about the behaviour and expected range of the statistics. The artificial models show that the opposite of the ""rich-get-richer"" effect requires the existence of inequality of degree in a network. Overall, we show that measuring the hierarchical mobility of a temporal network is an invaluable resource for discovering its underlying structural dynamics."
2502.02386,"We propose a generative model of temporally-evolving hypergraphs in which hyperedges form via noisy copying of previous hyperedges. Our proposed model reproduces several stylized facts from many empirical hypergraphs, is learnable from data, and defines a likelihood over a complete hypergraph rather than ego-based or other sub-hypergraphs. Analyzing our model, we derive descriptions of node degree, edge size, and edge intersection size distributions in terms of the model parameters. We also show several features of empirical hypergraphs which are and are not successfully captured by our model. We provide a scalable stochastic expectation maximization algorithm with which we can fit our model to hypergraph data sets with millions of nodes and edges. Finally, we assess our model on a hypergraph link prediction task, finding that an instantiation of our model with just 11 parameters can achieve competitive predictive performance with large neural networks."
2502.02681,"Social media is a primary medium for information diffusion during natural disasters. The social media ecosystem has been used to identify destruction, analyze opinions and organize aid. While the overall picture and aggregate trends may be important, a crucial part of the picture is the connections on these sites. These bridges are essential to facilitate information flow within the network. In this work, we perform a multi-platform analysis (X, Reddit, YouTube) of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which occurred in quick session to each other in the US in late 2024. We construct network graphs to understand the properties of effective bridging content and users. We find that bridges tend to exist on X, that bridging content is complex, and that bridging users have relatable affiliations related to gender, race and job. Public organizations can use these characteristics to manage their social media personas during natural disasters more effectively."
2502.02943,"Online communities play a critical role in shaping societal discourse and influencing collective behavior in the real world. The tendency for people to connect with others who share similar characteristics and views, known as homophily, plays a key role in the formation of echo chambers which further amplify polarization and division. Existing works examining homophily in online communities traditionally infer it using content- or adjacency-based approaches, such as constructing explicit interaction networks or performing topic analysis. These methods fall short for platforms where interaction networks cannot be easily constructed and fail to capture the complex nature of user interactions across the platform. This work introduces a novel approach for quantifying user homophily. We first use an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework to infer users' policies, then use these policies as a measure of behavioral homophily. We apply our method to Reddit, conducting a case study across 5.9 million interactions over six years, demonstrating how this approach uncovers distinct behavioral patterns and user roles that vary across different communities. We further validate our behavioral homophily measure against traditional content-based homophily, offering a powerful method for analyzing social media dynamics and their broader societal implications. We find, among others, that users can behave very similarly (high behavioral homophily) when discussing entirely different topics like soccer vs e-sports (low topical homophily), and that there is an entire class of users on Reddit whose purpose seems to be to disagree with others."
2502.03411,"Cryptocurrency network analysis consists of applying the tools and methods of social network analysis to transactional data issued from cryptocurrencies. The main difference with most online social networks is that users do not exchange textual content but instead value -- in systems designed mainly as cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin -- or digital items and services in more permissive systems based on smart contracts such as Ethereum."
2502.03433,"Social media networks have amplified the reach of social and political movements, but most research focuses on mainstream platforms such as X, Reddit, and Facebook, overlooking Discord. As a rapidly growing, community-driven platform with optional decentralized moderation, Discord offers unique opportunities to study political discourse. This study analyzes over 30 million messages from political servers on Discord discussing the 2024 U.S. elections. Servers were classified as Republican-aligned, Democratic-aligned, or unaligned based on their descriptions. We tracked changes in political conversation during key campaign events and identified distinct political valence and implicit biases in semantic association through embedding analysis. We observed that Republican servers emphasized economic policies, while Democratic servers focused on equality-related and progressive causes. Furthermore, we detected an increase in toxic language, such as sexism, in Republican-aligned servers after Kamala Harris's nomination. These findings provide a first look at political behavior on Discord, highlighting its growing role in shaping and understanding online political engagement."
2502.03623,"In an ideal world, every scientist's contribution would be fully recognized, driving collective scientific progress. In reality, however, only a few scientists are recognized and remembered. Sociologist Robert Merton first described this disparity between contribution and recognition as the Matthew Effect, where citations disproportionately favor established scientists, even when their contributions are no greater than those of junior peers. Merton's work, however, did not account for coauthored papers, where citations acknowledge teams rather than individual authors. How do teams affect reward systems in science? We hypothesize that teams will divide and obscure intellectual credit, making it even harder to recognize individual contributions. To test this, we developed and analyzed the world's first large-scale observational dataset on author contributions, derived from LaTeX source files of 1.6 million papers authored by 2 million scientists. We also quantified individual credits within teams using a validated algorithm and examined their relationship to contributions, accounting for factors such as team size, career stage, and historical time. Our findings confirm that teams amplify the Matthew Effect and overshadow individual contributions. As scientific research shifts from individual efforts to collaborative teamwork, this study highlights the urgent need for effective credit assignment practices in team-based science."
2502.03662,"Generating high-quality synthetic networks with realistic community structure is vital to effectively evaluate community detection algorithms. In this study, we propose a new synthetic network generator called the Edge-Connected Stochastic Block Model (EC-SBM). The goal of EC-SBM is to take a given clustered real-world network and produce a synthetic network that resembles the clustered real-world network with respect to both network and community-specific criteria. In particular, we focus on simulating the internal edge connectivity of the clusters in the reference clustered network. Our extensive performance study on large real-world networks shows that EC-SBM has high accuracy in both network and community-specific criteria, and is generally more accurate than current alternative approaches for this problem. Furthermore, EC-SBM is fast enough to scale to real-world networks with millions of nodes."
2502.04341,"In network research, Community Detection has always been a topic of significant interest in network science, with numerous papers and algorithms proposing to uncover the underlying structures within networks. In this paper, we conduct a comparative analysis of several prominent community detection algorithms applied to the SNAP Social Circles Dataset, derived from the Facebook Social Media network. The algorithms implemented include Louvain, Girvan-Newman, Spectral Clustering, K-Means Clustering, etc. We evaluate the performance of these algorithms based on various metrics such as modularity, normalized cut-ratio, silhouette score, compactness, and separability. Our findings reveal insights into the effectiveness of each algorithm in detecting various meaningful communities within the social network, shedding light on their strength and limitations. This research contributes to the understanding of community detection methods and provides valuable guidance for their application in analyzing real-world social networks."
2502.04777,"Community structure is a key feature omnipresent in real-world network data. Plethora of methods have been proposed to reveal subsets of densely interconnected nodes using criteria such as the modularity index. These approaches have been successful for undirected graphs, but directed edge information has not yet been dealt with in a satisfactory way. Here, we revisit the concept of directed communities as a mapping between sending and receiving communities. This translates into a new definition that we term bimodularity. Using convex relaxation, bimodularity can be optimized with the singular value decomposition of the directed modularity matrix. Subsequently, we propose an edge-based clustering approach to reveal the directed communities including their mappings. The feasibility of the new framework is illustrated on a synthetic model and further applied to the neuronal wiring diagram of the \textit{C. elegans}, for which it yields meaningful feedforward loops of the head and body motion systems. This framework sets the ground for the understanding and detection of community structures in directed networks."
2502.05049,"Understanding the sociodemographic composition of online platforms is essential for accurately interpreting digital behavior and its societal implications. Yet, current methods often lack the transparency and reliability required, risking misrepresenting social identities and distorting our understanding of digital society. Here, we introduce a principled framework for sociodemographic inference on Reddit that leverages over 850,000 user self-declarations of age, gender, and partisan affiliation. By training models on sparse user activity signals from this extensive, self-disclosed dataset, we demonstrate that simple probabilistic models, such as Naive Bayes, outperform more complex embedding-based alternatives. Our approach improves classification performance over the state of the art by up to 19% in ROC AUC and maintains quantification error below 15%. The models produce well-calibrated and interpretable outputs, enabling uncertainty estimation and subreddit-level feature importance analysis. More broadly, this work advocates for a shift toward more ethical and transparent computational social science by grounding sociodemographic analysis in user-provided data rather than researcher assumptions."
2502.05255,"Affective polarization and political sorting drive public antagonism around issues at the science-policy nexus. Looking at the COVID-19 period, we study cross-domain spillover of incivility and contentiousness in public engagements with climate change and public health on Twitter and Reddit. We find strong evidence of the signatures of affective polarization surrounding COVID-19 spilling into the climate change domain. Across different social media systems, COVID-19 content is associated with incivility and contentiousness in climate discussions. These patterns of increased antagonism were responsive to pandemic events that made the link between science and public policy more salient. The observed spillover activated along pre-pandemic political cleavages, specifically anti-internationalist populist beliefs, that linked climate policy opposition to vaccine hesitancy. Our findings show how affective polarization in public engagement with science becomes entrenched across science policy domains."
2502.05472,"Signed graph clustering is a critical technique for discovering community structures in graphs that exhibit both positive and negative relationships. We have identified two significant challenges in this domain: i) existing signed spectral methods are highly vulnerable to noise, which is prevalent in real-world scenarios; ii) the guiding principle ``an enemy of my enemy is my friend'', rooted in \textit{Social Balance Theory}, often narrows or disrupts cluster boundaries in mainstream signed graph neural networks. Addressing these challenges, we propose the \underline{D}eep \underline{S}igned \underline{G}raph \underline{C}lustering framework (DSGC), which leverages \textit{Weak Balance Theory} to enhance preprocessing and encoding for robust representation learning. First, DSGC introduces Violation Sign-Refine to denoise the signed network by correcting noisy edges with high-order neighbor information. Subsequently, Density-based Augmentation enhances semantic structures by adding positive edges within clusters and negative edges across clusters, following \textit{Weak Balance} principles. The framework then utilizes \textit{Weak Balance} principles to develop clustering-oriented signed neural networks to broaden cluster boundaries by emphasizing distinctions between negatively linked nodes. Finally, DSGC optimizes clustering assignments by minimizing a regularized clustering loss. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate DSGC consistently outperforms all baselines, establishing a new benchmark in signed graph clustering."
2502.05622,"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 31, 2020. However, rumors of a ""mysterious virus"" had already been circulating in China in December 2019, possibly preceding the first confirmed COVID-19 case. Understanding how awareness about an emerging pandemic spreads through society is vital not only for enhancing disease surveillance, but also for mitigating demand shocks and social inequities, such as shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and essential supplies. Here we leverage a massive e-commerce dataset comprising 150 billion online queries and purchase records from 94 million people to detect the traces of early awareness and public response during the cryptic transmission period of COVID-19. Our analysis focuses on identifying information gaps across different demographic cohorts, revealing significant social inequities and the role of cultural factors in shaping awareness diffusion and response behaviors. By modeling awareness diffusion in heterogeneous social networks and analyzing online shopping behavior, we uncover the evolving characteristics of vulnerable populations. Our findings expand the theoretical understanding of awareness spread and social inequality in the early stages of a pandemic, highlighting the critical importance of e-commerce data and social network data in effectively and timely addressing future pandemic challenges. We also provide actionable recommendations to better manage and mitigate dynamic social inequalities in public health crises."
2502.05742,"The psychology of the individual is continuously changing in nature, which has a significant influence on the evolutionary dynamics of populations. To study the influence of the continuously changing psychology of individuals on the behavior of populations, in this paper, we consider the game transitions of individuals in evolutionary processes to capture the changing psychology of individuals in reality, where the game that individuals will play shifts as time progresses and is related to the transition rates between different games. Besides, the individual's reputation is taken into account and utilized to choose a suitable neighbor for the strategy updating of the individual. Within this model, we investigate the statistical number of individuals staying in different game states and the expected number fits well with our theoretical results. Furthermore, we explore the impact of transition rates between different game states, payoff parameters, the reputation mechanism, and different time scales of strategy updates on cooperative behavior, and our findings demonstrate that both the transition rates and reputation mechanism have a remarkable influence on the evolution of cooperation. Additionally, we examine the relationship between network size and cooperation frequency, providing valuable insights into the robustness of the model."
2502.05827,"Hyperedge prediction is a fundamental task to predict future high-order relations based on the observed network structure. Existing hyperedge prediction methods, however, suffer from the data sparsity problem. To alleviate this problem, negative sampling methods can be used, which leverage non-existing hyperedges as contrastive information for model training. However, the following important challenges have been rarely studied: (C1) lack of guidance for generating negatives and (C2) possibility of producing false negatives. To address them, we propose a novel hyperedge prediction method, HyGEN, that employs (1) a negative hyperedge generator that employs positive hyperedges as a guidance to generate more realistic ones and (2) a regularization term that prevents the generated hyperedges from being false negatives. Extensive experiments on six real-world hypergraphs reveal that HyGEN consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art hyperedge prediction methods."
2502.05919,"Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM) is an emerging simulation paradigm that combines the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models with traditional Agent-Based Modeling to replicate complex social behaviors, including interactions on social media. While prior work has focused on localized phenomena such as opinion formation and information spread, its potential to capture global network dynamics remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing GABM-based social media simulations through the lens of the Friendship Paradox (FP), a counterintuitive phenomenon where individuals, on average, have fewer friends than their friends. We propose a GABM framework for social media simulations, featuring generative agents that emulate real users with distinct personalities and interests. Using Twitter datasets on the US 2020 Election and the QAnon conspiracy, we show that the FP emerges naturally in GABM simulations. Consistent with real-world observations, the simulations unveil a hierarchical structure, where agents preferentially connect with others displaying higher activity or influence. Additionally, we find that infrequent connections primarily drive the FP, reflecting patterns in real networks. These findings validate GABM as a robust tool for modeling global social media phenomena and highlight its potential for advancing social science by enabling nuanced analysis of user behavior."
2502.06748,"Getting a group to adopt cooperative norms is an enduring challenge. But in real-world settings, individuals don't just passively accept static environments, they act both within and upon the social systems that structure their interactions. Should we expect the dynamism of player-driven changes to the ""rules of the game"" to hinder cooperation -- because of the substantial added complexity -- or help it, as prosocial agents tweak their environment toward non-zero-sum games? We introduce a laboratory setting to test whether groups can guide themselves to cooperative outcomes by manipulating the environmental parameters that shape their emergent cooperation process. We test for cooperation in a set of economic games that impose different social dilemmas. These games vary independently in the institutional features of stability, efficiency, and fairness. By offering agency over behavior along with second-order agency over the rules of the game, we understand emergent cooperation in naturalistic settings in which the rules of the game are themselves dynamic and subject to choice. The literature on transfer learning in games suggests that interactions between features are important and might aid or hinder the transfer of cooperative learning to new settings."
2502.07042,"Departments within a university are not only administrative units, but also an effort to gather investigators around common fields of academic study. A pervasive challenge is connecting members with shared research interests both within and between departments. Here I describe a workflow that adapts methods from natural language processing to generate a network connecting $n=79$ members of a university department, or multiple departments within a faculty ($n=278$), based on common topics in their research publications. After extracting and processing terms from $n=16,901$ abstracts in the PubMed database, the co-occurrence of terms is encoded in a sparse document-term matrix. Based on the angular distances between the presence-absence vectors for every pair of terms, I use the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) method to embed the terms into a representational space such that terms that tend to appear in the same documents are closer together. Each author's corpus defines a probability distribution over terms in this space. Using the Wasserstein distance to quantify the similarity between these distributions, I generate a distance matrix among authors that can be analyzed and visualized as a graph. I demonstrate that this nonparametric method produces clusters with distinct themes that are consistent with some academic divisions, while identifying untapped connections among members. A documented workflow comprising Python and R scripts is available under the MIT license atthis https URL."
2502.07263,"Recognition of individual contributions is fundamental to the scientific reward system, yet coauthored papers obscure who did what. Traditional proxies-author order and career stage-reinforce biases, while contribution statements remain self-reported and limited to select journals. We construct the first large-scale dataset on writing contributions by analyzing author-specific macros in LaTeX files from 1.6 million papers (1991-2023) by 2 million scientists. Validation against self-reported statements (precision = 0.87), author order patterns, field-specific norms, and Overleaf records (Spearman's rho = 0.6, p < 0.05) confirms the reliability of the created data. Using explicit section information, we reveal a hidden division of labor within scientific teams: some authors primarily contribute to conceptual sections (e.g., Introduction and Discussion), while others focus on technical sections (e.g., Methods and Experiments). These findings provide the first large-scale evidence of implicit labor division in scientific teams, challenging conventional authorship practices and informing institutional policies on credit allocation."
2502.07377,"The increased popularity of food communities on social media shapes the way people engage with food-related content. Due to the extensive consequences of such content on users' eating behavior, researchers have started studying the factors that drive user engagement with food in online platforms. However, while most studies focus on visual aspects of food content in social media, there exist only initial studies exploring the impact of nutritional content on user engagement. In this paper, we set out to close this gap and analyze food-related posts on Reddit, focusing on the association between the nutritional density of a meal and engagement levels, particularly the number of comments. Hence, we collect and empirically analyze almost 600,000 food-related posts and uncover differences in nutritional content between engaging and non-engaging posts. Moreover, we train a series of XGBoost models, and evaluate the importance of nutritional density while predicting whether users will comment on a post or whether a post will substantially resonate with the community. We find that nutritional features improve the baseline model's accuracy by 4%, with a positive contribution of calorie density towards prediction of engagement, suggesting that higher nutritional content is associated with higher user engagement in food-related posts. Our results provide valuable insights for the design of more engaging online initiatives aimed at, for example, encouraging healthy eating habits."
2502.07412,"Network science is an interdisciplinary field that transcends traditional academic boundaries, offering profound insights into complex systems across disciplines. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of three leading journals, Social Networks, Network Science, and the Journal of Complex Networks, each representing a distinct yet interconnected perspective within the field. Social Networks focuses on empirical and theoretical advancements in social structures, emphasizing sociological and behavioral approaches. Network Science bridges physics, computer science, and applied mathematics to explore network dynamics in diverse domains. The Journal of Complex Networks, by contrast, is dedicated to the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of network theory. By employing co-authorship and citation network analysis, we map the intellectual landscape of these journals, identifying key contributors, influential works, and structural trends in collaboration. Through centrality measures such as degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality, we uncover the most impactful publications and their roles in shaping the discourse within and beyond their respective domains. Our analysis not only delineates the disciplinary contours of network science but also highlights its convergence points, revealing the evolving trajectory of this dynamic and rapidly expanding field."
2502.07694,"Social network analysis is pivotal for organizations aiming to leverage the vast amounts of data generated from user interactions on social media and other digital platforms. These interactions often reveal complex social structures, such as tightly-knit groups based on common interests, which are crucial for enhancing service personalization or fraud detection. Traditional methods like community detection and graph matching, while useful, often fall short of accurately identifying specific groups of users. This paper introduces a novel framework specifically designed to identify groups of users within transactional graphs by focusing on the contextual and structural nuances that define these groups."
2502.08404,"In this study, we constructed an emotion index that quantitatively represents the collective emotions present in the Japanese web space by utilizing Social Networking Service (SNS) post data. Building upon previous research that used blog data and the Profile of Mood States (POMS), we restructured the methodology using posts from X (formerly Twitter) and updated the model by adding the ``Friendliness"" indicator from the POMS2 metrics. Through periodic and trend analyses of the emotional indicators derived from X's post data, we found that the extension is consistent with results previously reported using blog data. This suggests that our methodology effectively captures typical emotional fluctuations in Japanese society, independent of specific SNS platforms, and is expected to serve as an index to visualize societal trends."
2502.08691,"Understanding human behavior and society is a central focus in social sciences, with the rise of generative social science marking a significant paradigmatic shift. By leveraging bottom-up simulations, it replaces costly and logistically challenging traditional experiments with scalable, replicable, and systematic computational approaches for studying complex social dynamics. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further transformed this research paradigm, enabling the creation of human-like generative social agents and realistic simulacra of society. In this paper, we propose AgentSociety, a large-scale social simulator that integrates LLM-driven agents, a realistic societal environment, and a powerful large-scale simulation engine. Based on the proposed simulator, we generate social lives for over 10k agents, simulating their 5 million interactions both among agents and between agents and their environment. Furthermore, we explore the potential of AgentSociety as a testbed for computational social experiments, focusing on four key social issues: polarization, the spread of inflammatory messages, the effects of universal basic income policies, and the impact of external shocks such as hurricanes. These four issues serve as valuable cases for assessing AgentSociety's support for typical research methods -- such as surveys, interviews, and interventions -- as well as for investigating the patterns, causes, and underlying mechanisms of social issues. The alignment between AgentSociety's outcomes and real-world experimental results not only demonstrates its ability to capture human behaviors and their underlying mechanisms, but also underscores its potential as an important platform for social scientists and policymakers."
2502.08841,"Illegal content on social media poses significant societal harm and necessitates timely removal. However, the impact of the speed of content removal on prevalence, reach, and exposure to illegal content remains underexplored. This study examines the relationship with a systematic analysis of takedown delays using data from the EU Digital Services Act Transparency Database, covering five major platforms over a one-year period. We find substantial variation in takedown delay, with some content remaining online for weeks or even months. To evaluate how these delays affect the prevalence and reach of illegal content and exposure to it, we develop an agent-based model and calibrate it to empirical data. We simulate illegal content diffusion, revealing that rapid takedown (within hours) significantly reduces prevalence, reach, and exposure to illegal content, while longer delays fail to reduce its spread. Though the effect of delay may seem intuitive, our simulations quantify exactly how takedown speed shapes the spread of illegal content. Building on these results, we point to the benefits of faster content removal to effectively curb the spread of illegal content, while also considering the limitations of strict enforcement policies."
2502.09768,"Complex network theory provides a unifying framework for the study of structured dynamic systems. The current literature emphasizes a widely reported phenomenon of intermittent interaction among network vertices. In this paper, we introduce a complex network model that considers the stochastic switching of individuals between activated and quiescent states at power-law rates and the corresponding evolutionary dynamics. By using the Markov chain and renewal theory, we discover a homogeneous stationary distribution of activated sizes in the network with power-law activating patterns and infer some statistical characteristics. To better understand the effect of power-law activating patterns, we study the two-person-two-strategy evolutionary game dynamics, demonstrate the absorbability of strategies, and obtain the critical cooperation conditions for prisoner's dilemmas in homogeneous networks without mutation. The evolutionary dynamics in real networks are also discussed. Our results provide a new perspective to analyze and understand social physics in time-evolving network systems."
2502.10701,"This paper characterizes the self-disclosure behavior of Reddit users across 11 different types of self-disclosure. We find that at least half of the users share some type of disclosure in at least 10% of their posts, with half of these posts having more than one type of disclosure. We show that different types of self-disclosure are likely to receive varying levels of engagement. For instance, a Sexual Orientation disclosure garners more comments than other self-disclosures. We also explore confounding factors that affect future self-disclosure. We show that users who receive interactions from (self-disclosure) specific subreddit members are more likely to disclose in the future. We also show that privacy risks due to self-disclosure extend beyond Reddit users themselves to include their close contacts, such as family and friends, as their information is also revealed. We develop a browser plugin for end-users to flag self-disclosure in their content."
2502.1075,"Community detection is a cornerstone problem in social network analysis (SNA), aimed at identifying cohesive communities with minimal external links. However, the rise of generative AI and Metaverse introduce complexities by creating hybrid human-AI social networks (denoted by HASNs), where traditional methods fall short, especially in human-centric settings. This paper introduces a novel community detection problem in HASNs (denoted by MetaCD), which seeks to enhance human connectivity within communities while reducing the presence of AI nodes. Effective processing of MetaCD poses challenges due to the delicate trade-off between excluding certain AI nodes and maintaining community structure. To address this, we propose CUSA, an innovative framework incorporating AI-aware clustering techniques that navigate this trade-off by selectively retaining AI nodes that contribute to community integrity. Furthermore, given the scarcity of real-world HASNs, we devise four strategies for synthesizing these networks under various hypothetical scenarios. Empirical evaluations on real social networks, reconfigured as HASNs, demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach compared to traditional non-deep learning and graph neural network (GNN)-based methods."
2502.10967,"Existing cross-network node classification methods are mainly proposed for closed-set setting, where the source network and the target network share exactly the same label space. Such a setting is restricted in real-world applications, since the target network might contain additional classes that are not present in the source. In this work, we study a more realistic open-set cross-network node classification (O-CNNC) problem, where the target network contains all the known classes in the source and further contains several target-private classes unseen in the source. Borrowing the concept from open-set domain adaptation, all target-private classes are defined as an additional unknown class. To address the challenging O-CNNC problem, we propose an unknown-excluded adversarial graph domain alignment (UAGA) model with a separate-adapt training strategy. Firstly, UAGA roughly separates known classes from unknown class, by training a graph neural network encoder and a neighborhood-aggregation node classifier in an adversarial framework. Then, unknown-excluded adversarial domain alignment is customized to align only target nodes from known classes with the source, while pushing target nodes from unknown class far away from the source, by assigning positive and negative domain adaptation coefficient to known class nodes and unknown class nodes. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate significant outperformance of the proposed UAGA over state-of-the-art methods on O-CNNC."
2502.11109,"We analyse the evolution of two large collaboration networks: the Microsoft Academic Graph (1800-2020) and Internet Movie Database (1900-2020), comprising $2.72 \times 10^8$ and $1.88 \times 10^6$ nodes respectively. The networks show super-linear growth, with node counts following power laws $N(t) \propto t^{\alpha}$ where $\alpha = 2.3$ increasing to $3.1$ after 1950 (MAG) and $\alpha = 1.8$ (IMDb). Node and edge processes maintain stable but noisy timescale ratios ($\tau_N/\tau_E \approx 2.8 \pm 0.3$ MAG, $2.3 \pm 0.2$ IMDb). The probability of waiting a time $t$ between successive collaborations was found to be scale-free, $P(t) \propto t^{-\gamma}$, with indices evolving from $\gamma \approx 2.3$ to $1.6$ (MAG) and $2.6$ to $2.1$ (IMDb). Academic collaboration sizes increased from $1.2$ to $5.8$ authors per paper, while entertainment collaborations remained more stable ($3.2$ to $4.5$ actors). These observations indicate that current network models might be enhanced by considering accelerating growth, coupled timescales, and environmental influence, while explaining stable local properties."
2502.11112,"We present a comprehensive parametric analysis of node and edge lifetimes processes in two large-scale collaboration networks: the Microsoft Academic Graph (1800-2020) and Internet Movie Database (1900-2020). Node and edge lifetimes (career and collaboration durations) follow Weibull distributions with consistent shape parameters ($k \approx 0.2$ for academic, $k \approx 0.5$ for entertainment careers) across centuries of evolution. These distributions persist despite dramatic changes in network size and structure. Edge processes show domain-specific evolution: academic collaboration durations increase over time (power-law index $1.6$ to $2.3$) while entertainment collaborations maintain more stable patterns (index $2.6$ to $2.1$). These findings indicate that while career longevity exhibits consistent patterns, collaboration dynamics appear to be influenced by domain-specific factors. The results provide new constraints for models of social network evolution, requiring incorporation of both universal lifetime distributions and domain-specific growth dynamics."
2502.11248,"Despite widespread concerns about the risks of AI-generated content (AIGC) to the integrity of social media discourse, little is known about its scale and scope, the actors responsible for its dissemination online, and the user responses it elicits. In this work, we measure and characterize the prevalence, spreaders, and emotional reception of AI-generated political images. Analyzing a large-scale dataset from Twitter/X related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we find that approximately 12% of shared images are detected as AI-generated, and around 10% of users are responsible for sharing 80% of AI-generated images. AIGC superspreaders--defined as the users who not only share a high volume of AI-generated images but also receive substantial engagement through retweets--are more likely to be X Premium subscribers, have a right-leaning orientation, and exhibit automated behavior. Their profiles contain a higher proportion of AI-generated images than non-superspreaders, and some engage in extreme levels of AIGC sharing. Moreover, superspreaders' AI image tweets elicit more positive and less toxic responses than their non-AI image tweets. This study serves as one of the first steps toward understanding the role generative AI plays in shaping online socio-political environments and offers implications for platform governance."
2502.11372,"This study examines degree distributions in two large collaboration networks: the Microsoft Academic Graph (1800-2020) and Internet Movie Database (1900-2020), comprising $2.72 \times 10^8$ and $1.88 \times 10^6$ nodes respectively. Statistical comparison using $\chi^2$ measures showed that Weibull distributions fit the degree distributions better than power-law or log-normal models, especially at later stages in the network evolution. The Weibull shape parameters exhibit notable stability ($k \approx 0.8$-$1.0$ for academic, $k \approx 0.9$-$1.1$ for entertainment collaborations) despite orders of magnitude growth in network size. While early-stage networks display approximate power-law scaling, mature networks develop characteristic flattening in the low-degree region that Weibull distributions appear to capture better. In the academic network, the cutoff between the flattened region and power-law tail shows a gradual increase from $5$ to $9$ edges over time, while the entertainment network maintains a distinctive degree structure that may reflect storytelling and cast-size constraints. These patterns suggest the possibility that collaboration network evolution might be influenced more by constraint-based growth than by pure preferential attachment or multiplicative processes."
2502.11396,"Structural Hole (SH) spanners are the set of users who bridge different groups of users and are vital in numerous applications. Despite their importance, existing work for identifying SH spanners focuses only on static networks. However, real-world networks are highly dynamic where the underlying structure of the network evolves continuously. Consequently, we study SH spanner problem for dynamic networks. We propose an efficient solution for updating SH spanners in dynamic networks. Our solution reuses the information obtained during the initial runs of the static algorithm and avoids the recomputations for the nodes unaffected by the updates. Experimental results show that the proposed solution achieves a minimum speedup of 3.24 over recomputation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address the problem of maintaining SH spanners in dynamic networks."
2502.11519,"Polarization and fragmentation in social media amplify user biases, making it increasingly important to understand the evolution of opinions. Opinion dynamics provide interpretability for studying opinion evolution, yet incorporating these insights into predictive models remains challenging. This challenge arises due to the inherent complexity of the diversity of opinion fusion rules and the difficulty in capturing equilibrium states while avoiding over-smoothing. This paper constructs a unified opinion dynamics model to integrate different opinion fusion rules and generates corresponding synthetic datasets. To fully leverage the advantages of unified opinion dynamics, we introduces UniGO, a framework for modeling opinion evolution on graphs. Using a coarsen-refine mechanism, UniGO efficiently models opinion dynamics through a graph neural network, mitigating over-smoothing while preserving equilibrium phenomena. UniGO leverages pretraining on synthetic datasets, which enhances its ability to generalize to real-world scenarios, providing a viable paradigm for applications of opinion dynamics. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate UniGO's effectiveness in capturing complex opinion formation processes and predicting future evolution. The pretrained model also shows strong generalization capability, validating the benefits of using synthetic data to boost real-world performance."
2502.11827,"An important part of online activities are intended to control the public opinion and behavior, being considered currently a global threat. This article identifies and conceptualizes seven online strategies employed in social media influence operations. These procedures are quantified through the analysis of 80 incidents of foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI), estimating their real-world usage and combination. Finally, we suggest future directions for research on influence operations."
2502.12009,"This study uses sentiment analysis and the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) to characterise news content in social media and examine its association with user engagement. We employ Natural Language Processing to quantify the moral and affective linguistic markers. At the same time, we automatically define thematic macro areas of news from major U.S. news outlets and their Twitter followers (Jan 2020 - Mar 2021). By applying Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation to the obtained linguistic features we extract clusters of similar moral and affective profiles, and we identify the emotional and moral characteristics that mostly explain user engagement via regression modelling. We observe that Surprise, Trust, and Harm are crucial elements explaining user engagement and discussion length and that Twitter content from news media outlets has more explanatory power than their linked articles. We contribute with actionable findings evidencing the potential impact of employing specific moral and affective nuances in public and journalistic discourse in today's communication landscape. In particular, our results emphasise the need to balance engagement strategies with potential priming risks in our evolving media landscape."
2502.12523,"Hypergraphs, increasingly utilised for modelling complex and diverse relationships in modern networks, gain much attention representing intricate higher-order interactions. Among various challenges, cohesive subgraph discovery is one of the fundamental problems and offers deep insights into these structures, yet the task of selecting appropriate parameters is an open question. To handle that question, we aim to design an efficient indexing structure to retrieve cohesive subgraphs in an online manner. The main idea is to enable the discovery of corresponding structures within a reasonable time without the need for exhaustive graph traversals. This work can facilitate efficient and informed decision-making in diverse applications based on a comprehensive understanding of the entire network landscape. Through extensive experiments on real-world networks, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed indexing technique."
2502.12654,"In this paper we show how The Free Energy Principle (FEP) can provide an explanation for why real-world networks deviate from scale-free behaviour, and how these characteristic deviations can emerge from constraints on information processing. We propose a minimal FEP model for node behaviour reveals three distinct regimes: when detection noise dominates, agents seek better information, reducing isolated agents compared to expectations from classical preferential attachment. In the optimal detection regime, super-linear growth emerges from compounded improvements in detection, belief, and action, which produce a preferred cluster scale. Finally, saturation effects occur as limits on the agent's information processing capabilities prevent indefinite cluster growth. These regimes produce the knee-shaped degree distributions observed in real networks, explaining them as signatures of agents with optimal information processing under constraints. We show that agents evolving under FEP principles provides a mechanism for preferential attachment, connecting agent psychology with the macroscopic network features that underpin the structure of real-world networks."
2502.12704,"Sequential learning models situations where agents predict a ground truth in sequence, by using their private, noisy measurements, and the predictions of agents who came earlier in the sequence. We study sequential learning in a social network, where agents only see the actions of the previous agents in their own neighborhood. The fraction of agents who predict the ground truth correctly depends heavily on both the network topology and the ordering in which the predictions are made. A natural question is to find an ordering, with a given network, to maximize the (expected) number of agents who predict the ground truth correctly. In this paper, we show that it is in fact NP-hard to answer this question for a general network, with both the Bayesian learning model and a simple majority rule model. Finally, we show that even approximating the answer is hard."
2502.12777,"Link prediction (LP) is an important problem in network science and machine learning research. The state-of-the-art LP methods are usually evaluated in a uniform setup, ignoring several factors associated with the data and application specific needs. We identify a number of such factors, such as, network-type, problem-type, geodesic distance between the end nodes and its distribution over the classes, nature and applicability of LP methods, class imbalance and its impact on early retrieval, evaluation metric, etc., and present an experimental setup which allows us to evaluate LP methods in a rigorous and controlled manner. We perform extensive experiments with a variety of LP methods over real network datasets in this controlled setup, and gather valuable insights on the interactions of these factors with the performance of LP through an array of carefully designed hypotheses. Following the insights, we provide recommendations to be followed as best practice for evaluating LP methods."
2502.12847,"Understanding how cognitive and social mechanisms shape the evolution of complex artifacts such as songs is central to cultural evolution research. Social network topology (what artifacts are available?), selection (which are chosen?), and reproduction (how are they copied?) have all been proposed as key influencing factors. However, prior research has rarely studied them together due to methodological challenges. We address this gap through a controlled naturalistic paradigm whereby participants (N=2,404) are placed in networks and are asked to iteratively choose and sing back melodies from their neighbors. We show that this setting yields melodies that are more complex and more pleasant than those found in the more-studied linear transmission setting, and exhibits robust differences across topologies. Crucially, these differences are diminished when selection or reproduction bias are eliminated, suggesting an interaction between mechanisms. These findings shed light on the interplay of mechanisms underlying the evolution of cultural artifacts."
2502.12973,"Although social networks have expanded the range of ideas and information accessible to users, they are also criticized for amplifying the polarization of user opinions. Given the inherent complexity of these phenomena, existing approaches to counteract these effects typically rely on handcrafted algorithms and heuristics. We propose an elegant solution: we act on the network weights that model user interactions on social networks (e.g., frequency of communication), to optimize a performance metric (e.g., polarization reduction), while users' opinions follow the classical Friedkin-Johnsen model. Our formulation gives rise to a challenging large-scale optimization problem with non-convex constraints, for which we develop a gradient-based algorithm. Our scheme is simple, scalable, and versatile, as it can readily integrate different, potentially non-convex, objectives. We demonstrate its merit by: (i) rapidly solving complex social network intervention problems with 3 million variables based on the Reddit and DBLP datasets; (ii) significantly outperforming competing approaches in terms of both computation time and disagreement reduction."
2502.13322,"Social networks scaffold the diffusion of information on social media. Much attention has been given to the spread of true vs. false content on online social platforms, including the structural differences between their diffusion patterns. However, much less is known about how platform interventions on false content alter the engagement with and diffusion of such content. In this work, we estimate the causal effects of Community Notes, a novel fact-checking feature adopted by X (formerly Twitter) to solicit and vet crowd-sourced fact-checking notes for false content. We gather detailed time series data for 40,074 posts for which notes have been proposed and use synthetic control methods to estimate a range of counterfactual outcomes. We find that attaching fact-checking notes significantly reduces the engagement with and diffusion of false content. We estimate that, on average, the notes resulted in reductions of 45.7% in reposts, 43.5% in likes, 22.9% in replies, and 14.0% in views after being attached. Over the posts' entire lifespans, these reductions amount to 11.4% fewer reposts, 13.0% fewer likes, 7.3% fewer replies, and 5.7% fewer views on average. In reducing reposts, we observe that diffusion cascades for fact-checked content are less deep, but not less broad, than synthetic control estimates for non-fact-checked content with similar reach. This structural difference contrasts notably with differences between false vs. true content diffusion itself, where false information diffuses farther, but with structural patterns that are otherwise indistinguishable from those of true information, conditional on reach."
2502.13571,"The Influence Maximization (IM) problem aims to find a small set of influential users to maximize their influence spread in a social network. Traditional methods rely on fixed diffusion models with known parameters, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. In contrast, graph representation learning-based methods have gained wide attention for overcoming this limitation by learning user representations to capture influence characteristics. However, existing studies are built on Euclidean space, which fails to effectively capture the latent hierarchical features of social influence distribution. As a result, users' influence spread cannot be effectively measured through the learned representations. To alleviate these limitations, we propose HIM, a novel diffusion model agnostic method that leverages hyperbolic representation learning to estimate users' potential influence spread from social propagation data. HIM consists of two key components. First, a hyperbolic influence representation module encodes influence spread patterns from network structure and historical influence activations into expressive hyperbolic user representations. Hence, the influence magnitude of users can be reflected through the geometric properties of hyperbolic space, where highly influential users tend to cluster near the space origin. Second, a novel adaptive seed selection module is developed to flexibly and effectively select seed users using the positional information of learned user representations. Extensive experiments on five network datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our method for the IM problem with unknown diffusion model parameters, highlighting its potential for large-scale real-world social networks."
2502.13607,"We analysed two large collaboration networks -- the Microsoft Academic Graph (1800-2020) and Internet Movie Database (1900-2020) -- to quantify network responses to major historical events. Our analysis revealed four properties of network-environment interaction. First, historical events can influence network evolution, with effects persisting far longer than previously recognised; the academic network showed 45\% declines during World Wars and 90\% growth during La Belle Epoque. Second, node and edge processes exhibited different environmental sensitivities; while node addition/removal tracked historical events, edge formation maintained stable statistical properties even during major disruptions. Third, different collaboration networks showed distinct response patterns; academic networks displayed sharp disruptions and rapid recoveries, while entertainment networks showed gradual changes and greater resilience. Fourth, both networks developed increasing resilience. Our results provide new insights for modelling network evolution and managing collaborative systems during periods of external disruption."
2502.14294,"Community detection on attributed graphs with rich semantic and topological information offers great potential for real-world network analysis, especially user matching in online games. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently enabled Deep Graph Clustering (DGC) methods to learn cluster assignments from semantic and topological information. However, their success depends on the prior knowledge related to the number of communities $K$, which is unrealistic due to the high costs and privacy issues ofthis http URLthis paper, we investigate the community detection problem without prior $K$, referred to as $K$-Free Community Detection problem. To address this problem, we propose a novel Deep Adaptive and Generative model~(DAG) for community detection without specifying the prior $K$. DAG consists of three key components, \textit{i.e.,} a node representation learning module with masked attribute reconstruction, a community affiliation readout module, and a community number search module with group sparsity. These components enable DAG to convert the process of non-differentiable grid search for the community number, \textit{i.e.,} a discrete hyperparameter in existing DGC methods, into a differentiable learning process. In such a way, DAG can simultaneously perform community detection and community number search end-to-end. To alleviate the cost of acquiring community labels in real-world applications, we design a new metric, EDGE, to evaluate community detection methods even when the labels are not feasible. Extensive offline experiments on five public datasets and a real-world online mobile game dataset demonstrate the superiority of our DAG over the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. DAG has a relative increase of 7.35\% in teams in a Tencent online game compared with the best competitor."
2502.14403,"Cross-domain fake news detection aims to mitigate domain shift and improve detection performance by transferring knowledge across domains. Existing approaches transfer knowledge based on news content and user engagements from a source domain to a target domain. However, these approaches face two main limitations, hindering effective knowledge transfer and optimal fake news detection performance. Firstly, from a micro perspective, they neglect the negative impact of veracity-irrelevant features in news content when transferring domain-shared features across domains. Secondly, from a macro perspective, existing approaches ignore the relationship between user engagement and news content, which reveals shared behaviors of common users across domains and can facilitate more effective knowledge transfer. To address these limitations, we propose a novel macro- and micro- hierarchical transfer learning framework (MMHT) for cross-domain fake news detection. Firstly, we propose a micro-hierarchical disentangling module to disentangle veracity-relevant and veracity-irrelevant features from news content in the source domain for improving fake news detection performance in the target domain. Secondly, we propose a macro-hierarchical transfer learning module to generate engagement features based on common users' shared behaviors in different domains for improving effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines."
2502.14764,"Data recording connections between people in communities and villages are collected and analyzed in various ways, most often as either networks of individuals or as networks of households. These two networks can differ in substantial ways. The methodological choice of which network to study, therefore, is an important aspect in both study design and data analysis. In this work, we consider various key differences between household and individual social network structure, and ways in which the networks cannot be used interchangeably. In addition to formalizing the choices for representing each network, we explore the consequences of how the results of social network analysis change depending on the choice between studying the individual and household network -- from determining whether networks are assortative or disassortative to the ranking of influence-maximizing nodes. As our main contribution, we draw upon related work to propose a set of systematic recommendations for determining the relevant network representation to study. Our recommendations include assessing a series of entitativity criteria and relating these criteria to theories and observations about patterns and norms in social dynamics at the household level: notably, how information spreads within households and how power structures and gender roles affect this spread. We draw upon the definition of an illusion of entitativity to identify cases wherein grouping people into households does not satisfy these criteria or adequately represent given cultural or experimental contexts. Given the widespread use of social network data for studying communities, there is broad impact in understanding which network to study and the consequences of that decision. We hope that this work gives guidance to practitioners and researchers collecting and studying social network data."
2502.15236,"The minimal dominating set (MDS) is a well-established concept in network controllability and has been successfully applied in various domains, including sensor placement, network resilience, and epidemic containment. In this study, we adapt the local-improvement MDS routine and explore its potential for enhancing seed selection for influence maximization in multilayer networks (MLN). We employ the Linear Threshold Model (LTM), which offers an intuitive representation of influence spread or opinion dynamics by accounting for peer influence accumulation. To ensure interpretability, we utilize rank-refining seed selection methods, with the results further filtered with MDS. Our findings reveal that incorporating MDS into the seed selection process improves spread only within a specific range of situations. Notably, the improvement is observed for larger seed set budgets, lower activation thresholds, and when an ""AND"" strategy is used to aggregate influence across network layers. This scenario reflects situations where an individual does not require the majority of their acquaintances to hold a target opinion, but must be influenced across all social circles."
2502.15321,"Politicians with large media visibility and social media audiences have a significant influence on public discourse. Consequently, their dissemination of misinformation can have profound implications for society. This study investigated the misinformation-sharing behavior of 3,277 politicians and associated public engagement by using data from X (formerly Twitter) during 2020-2021. The analysis was grounded in a novel and comprehensive dataset including over 400,000 tweets covering multiple levels of governance-national executive, national legislative, and regional executive-in Germany, Italy, the UK, and the USA, representing distinct clusters of misinformation resilience. Striking cross-country differences in misinformation-sharing behavior and public engagement were observed. Politicians in Italy (4.9%) and the USA (2.2%) exhibited the highest rates of misinformation sharing, primarily among far-right and conservative legislators. Public engagement with misinformation also varied significantly. In the USA, misinformation attracted over 2.5 times the engagement of reliable information. In Italy, engagement levels were similar across content types. Italy is unique in crisis-related misinformation, particularly regarding COVID-19, which surpassed general misinformation in both prevalence and audience engagement. These insights underscore the critical roles of political affiliation, governance level, and crisis contexts in shaping the dynamics of misinformation. The study expands the literature by providing a cross-national, multi-level perspective, shedding light on how political actors influence the proliferation of misinformation during crisis."
2502.15564,"Hypergraph, with its powerful ability to capture higher-order relationships, has gained significant attention recently. Consequently, many hypergraph representation learning methods have emerged to model the complex relationships among hypergraphs. In general, these methods leverage classic expansion methods to convert hypergraphs into weighted or bipartite graphs, and further employ message passing mechanisms to model the complex structures within hypergraphs. However, classical expansion methods are designed in straightforward manners with fixed edge weights, resulting in information loss or redundancy. In light of this, we design a novel clique expansion-based Adaptive Expansion method called AdE to adaptively expand hypergraphs into weighted graphs that preserve the higher-order structure information. Specifically, we introduce a novel Global Simulation Network to select two representative nodes for adaptively symbolizing each hyperedge and connect the rest of the nodes within the same hyperedge to the corresponding selected nodes. Afterward, we design a distance-aware kernel function, dynamically adjusting edge weights to ensure similar nodes within a hyperedge are connected with larger weights. Extensive theoretical justifications and empirical experiments over seven benchmark hypergraph datasets demonstrate that AdE has excellent rationality, generalization, and effectiveness compared to classic expansion models."
2502.1589,"As large graph datasets become increasingly common across many fields, sampling is often needed to reduce the graphs into manageable sizes. This procedure raises critical questions about representativeness as no sample can capture the properties of the original graph perfectly, and different parts of the graph are not evenly affected by the loss. Recent work has shown that the distances from the non-sampled nodes to the sampled nodes can be a quantitative indicator of bias and fairness in graph machine learning. However, to our knowledge, there is no method for evaluating how a sampling method affects the distribution of shortest-path distances without actually performing the sampling and shortest-path calculation.In this paper, we present an accurate and efficient framework for estimating the distribution of shortest-path distances to the sample, applicable to a wide range of sampling methods and graph structures. Our framework is faster than empirical methods and only requires the specification of degree distributions. We also extend our framework to handle graphs with community structures. While this introduces a decrease in accuracy, we demonstrate that our framework remains highly accurate on downstream comparison-based tasks. Code is publicly available atthis https URL."
2502.15931,"Opinion dynamics model how the publicly expressed opinions of users in a social network coevolve according to their neighbors as well as their own intrinsic opinion. Motivated by the real-world manipulation of social networks during the 2016 US elections and the 2019 Hong Kong protests, a growing body of work models the effects of a strategic actor who interferes with the network to induce disagreement or polarization. We lift the assumption of a single strategic actor by introducing a model in which any subset of network users can manipulate network outcomes. They do so by acting according to a fictitious intrinsic opinion. Strategic actors can have conflicting goals, and push competing narratives. We characterize the Nash Equilibrium of the resulting meta-game played by the strategic actors. Experiments on real-world social network datasets from Twitter, Reddit, and Political Blogs show that strategic agents can significantly increase polarization and disagreement, as well as increase the ""cost"" of the equilibrium. To this end, we give worst-case upper bounds on the Price of Misreporting (analogous to the Price of Anarchy). Finally, we give efficient learning algorithms for the platform to (i) detect whether strategic manipulation has occurred, and (ii) learn who the strategic actors are. Our algorithms are accurate on the same real-world datasets, suggesting how platforms can take steps to mitigate the effects of strategic behavior."
2502.15993,"Similarity network construction is a fundamental step in many approaches to community detection in biomedical analysis. It is utilised both in the creation of network structures from non-relational data and as a processing step in clustering pipelines. The foundation of any network analysis approach hinges on the quality of the underlying network. With the rising popularity of network learning and use of network-based clustering, the importance of correctly constructing the network is vital. The underlying mechanisms of similarity network construction, particularly the implications of the choice of approach for multi-modal integration, remain poorly explored. By introducing differences in embedded cluster information and noise levels across modalities, we assess the performance of popular similarity integration techniques such as Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) and NEighborhood based Multi-Omics clustering (NEMO). Notably, SNF and NEMO fail to outperform simpler techniques such as mean similarity aggregation when incorporating modalities with inconsistently embedded clusters. We demonstrate how integration methods can be used to incorporate partial modalities - datasets where not all individuals have a full set of measurements in all modalities. SNF shows significant sensitivity to incomplete modalities while NEMO and mean aggregation are more resilient."
2502.16038,"In an era of emotionally saturated digital media and information overload, effective communication demands more than clarity and accuracy-it requires emotional awareness. This review introduces the paradigm of emotion-aware design, a framework grounded in the valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) model of affect, which systematically examines how emotional modulation shapes comprehension, memory, and behavior. Drawing on insights from psychology, neuroscience, communication, and design, we show that emotional responses significantly influence how information is perceived, retained, and shared. We further propose a multimodal design space-encompassing text, visuals, audio, and interaction-that enables strategic regulation of emotional dimensions to enhance communication efficacy. By linking emotional dynamics to cognitive outcomes and practical design strategies, this review offers both a conceptual foundation and an applied roadmap for designing emotionally resonant communication across domains such as education, health, media, and public discourse."
2502.16382,"Many biological and social systems are naturally represented as edge-weighted directed or undirected hypergraphs since they exhibit group interactions involving three or more system units as opposed to pairwise interactions that can be incorporated in graph-theoretic representations. However, finding influential cores in hypergraphs is still not as extensively studied as their graph-theoretic counter-parts. To this end, we develop and implement a hypergraph-curvature guided discrete time diffusion process with suitable topological surgeries and edge-weight re-normalization procedures for both undirected and directed weighted hypergraphs to find influential cores. We successfully apply our framework for directed hypergraphs to seven metabolic hypergraphs and our framework for undirected hypergraphs to two social (co-authorship) hypergraphs to find influential cores, thereby demonstrating the practical feasibility of our approach. In addition, we prove a theorem showing that a certain edge weight re-normalization procedure in a prior research work for Ricci flows for edge-weighted graphs has the undesirable outcome of modifying the edge-weights to negative numbers, thereby rendering the procedure impossible to use. To the best of our knowledge, this seems to be one of the first articles that formulates algorithmic approaches for finding core(s) of (weighted or unweighted) directed hypergraphs."
2502.16845,"Progress in science and technology is punctuated by disruptive innovation and breakthroughs. Researchers have characterized these disruptions to explore the factors that spark such innovations and to assess their long-term trends. However, although understanding disruptive breakthroughs and their drivers hinges upon accurately quantifying disruptiveness, the core metric used in previous studies -- the disruption index -- remains insufficiently understood and tested. Here, after demonstrating the critical shortcomings of the disruption index, including its conflicting evaluations for simultaneous discoveries, we propose a new, continuous measure of disruptiveness based on a neural embedding framework that addresses these limitations. Our measure not only better distinguishes disruptive works, such as Nobel Prize-winning papers, from others, but also reveals simultaneous disruptions by allowing us to identify the ""twins"" that have the most similar future context. By offering a more robust and precise lens for identifying disruptive innovations and simultaneous discoveries, our study provides a foundation for deepening insights into the mechanisms driving scientific breakthroughs while establishing a more equitable basis for evaluating transformative contributions."
2502.16871,"Saudi Arabia faced a swift economic growth and societal transformation under Vision 2030. This offers a unique opportunity to track emerging trends in the region, which will ultimately pave the way for new business and investment possibilities. This paper explores how AI and social media analytics can identify and track trends across sectors such as construction, food and beverage, tourism, technology, and entertainment thereby helping the businesses make informed decisions. By leveraging a tailored AI-driven methodology, we analyzed millions of social media posts each month, classifying discussions and calculating scores to track the trends. The approach not only uncovered the emerging trends but also shows diminishing trends. Our methodology is able to predict the emergence and growth of trends by utilizing social media data. This approach has potential for adaptation in other regions. Ultimately, our findings highlight how ongoing, AI-powered trend analysis can enable more effective, data-informed business and development strategies in an increasingly dynamic environment."
2502.17054,"This study investigates the network characteristics of high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) travelers in urban public transport systems by analyzing 20 million smart card records from Beijing's transit network. A novel methodology integrates advanced data preprocessing, clustering techniques, and complex network analysis to differentiate HF and LF passenger behaviors and their impacts on network structure, robustness, and efficiency. The primary challenge is accurately segmenting and modeling the behaviors of diverse passenger groups within a large-scale, noisy dataset while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability. HF networks, representing the top 25% of travelers by usage frequency, exhibit high connectivity with an average clustering coefficient of 0.72 and greater node degree centrality. However, they have lower robustness, with efficiency declining by 35% under targeted disruptions and longer average path lengths of 6.2 during peak hours. In contrast, LF networks, which include 75% of travelers, are more dispersed yet resilient, with efficiency declining by only 10% under similar disruptions and stronger intracommunity connectivity. Temporal analysis reveals that HF passengers significantly contribute to peak-hour congestion, with 57.4% of HF trips occurring between 6:00 and 10:00 AM, while LF passengers show a broader temporal distribution, helping to mitigate congestion hotspots. Understanding these travel patterns is crucial for optimizing public transit systems. The findings suggest targeted strategies such as enhancing robustness in HF networks by diversifying key routes and improving accessibility in LF-dominated areas. This research provides a scalable framework for analyzing smart card data and offers actionable insights for optimizing transit networks, improving congestion management, and advancing sustainable urban mobility planning."
2502.17344,"Social media platforms have become key tools for coordinated influence operations, enabling state actors to manipulate public opinion through strategic, collective actions. While previous research has suggested collaboration between states, such research failed to leverage state-of-the-art coordination indicators or control datasets. In this study, we investigate inter-state coordination by analyzing multiple online behavioral traces and using sophisticated coordination detection models. By incorporating a control dataset to differentiate organic user activity from coordinated efforts, our findings reveal no evidence of inter-state coordination. These results challenge earlier claims and underscore the importance of robust methodologies and control datasets in accurately detecting online coordination."
2502.17542,"The content moderation systems used by social media sites are a topic of widespread interest and research, but less is known about the use of similar systems by web search engines. For example, Google Search attempts to help its users navigate three distinct types of data voids--when the available search results are deemed low-quality, low-relevance, or rapidly-changing--by placing one of three corresponding warning banners at the top of the search page. Here we collected 1.4M unique search queries shared on social media to surface Google's warning banners, examine when and why those banners were applied, and train deep learning models to identify data voids beyond Google's classifications. Across three data collection waves (Oct 2023, Mar 2024, Sept 2024), we found that Google returned a warning banner for about 1% of our search queries, with substantial churn in the set of queries that received a banner across waves. The low-quality banners, which warn users that their results ""may not have reliable information on this topic,"" were especially rare, and their presence was associated with low-quality domains in the search results and conspiracy-related keywords in the search query. Low-quality banner presence was also inconsistent over short time spans, even when returning highly similar search results. In August 2024, low-quality banners stopped appearing on the SERPs we collected, but average search result quality remained largely unchanged, suggesting they may have been discontinued by Google. Using our deep learning models to analyze both queries and search results in context, we identify 29 to 58 times more low-quality data voids than there were low-quality banners, and find a similar number after the banners had disappeared. Our findings point to the need for greater transparency on search engines' content moderation practices, especially around important events like elections."
2502.17926,"Traditional social media platforms, once envisioned as digital town squares, now face growing criticism over corporate control, content moderation, and privacy concerns. Events such as Twitter's acquisition (now X) and major policy changes have pushed users toward alternative platforms like Mastodon and Threads. However, this diversification has led to user dispersion and fragmented discussions across the walled gardens of social media platforms. To address these issues, federation protocols like ActivityPub have been adopted, with Mastodon leading efforts to build decentralized yet interconnected networks. In March 2024, Threads joined this federation by introducing its Fediverse Sharing service, which enables interactions such as posts, replies, and likes between Threads and Mastodon users as if on a unified platform. Building on this development, we study the interactions between 20,000+ Threads users and 20,000+ Mastodon users over a ten-month period. Our work lays the foundation for research on cross-platform interactions and federation-driven platform integration."

Existing deep generative approaches face significant challenges in real-world applications due to limited propagation data availability. We present SIDSL (\textbf{S}tructure-prior \textbf{I}nformed \textbf{D}iffusion model for \textbf{S}ource \textbf{L}ocalization), a generative diffusion framework that leverages topology-aware priors to enable robust source localization with limited data. SIDSL addresses three key challenges: unknown propagation patterns through structure-based source estimations via graph label propagation, complex topology-propagation relationships via a propagation-enhanced conditional denoiser with GNN-parameterized label propagation module, and class imbalance through structure-prior biased diffusion initialization. By learning pattern-invariant features from synthetic data generated by established propagation models, SIDSL enables effective knowledge transfer to real-world scenarios. Experimental evaluation on four real-world datasets demonstrates superior performance with 7.5-13.3\% F1 score improvements over baselines, including over 19\% improvement in few-shot and 40\% in zero-shot settings, validating the framework's effectiveness for practical source localization.

2502.17962,"Generative AI is shaping an increasingly hybrid society, where ideas and cultural artefacs are created both by humans and intelligent machines. Human creativity is influenced in complex, nonlinear ways by the actions of AI-driven agents within their social networks, but these influences are difficult to measure using traditional methods. This study examines how human-AI interactions shape the evolution of collective creation within large-scale social network experiments, where human and AI participants collectively create stories. Participants (either humans or AI) joined 5x5 grid-based networks in which stories were selected, modified, and shared over many iterations. Initially, AI-only networks showed greater creativity (rated by a separate group of human raters) and collective diversity of stories than human-only and human-AI networks. However, over time, hybrid human-AI networks became more diverse in their creations than AI-only networks. In part, this is because AI agents retained little from the original stories, while human-only networks preserved continuity. These findings highlight the value of experimental social networks in understanding human-AI hybrid societies."
2502.1804,"Popularity prediction in information cascades plays a crucial role in social computing, with broad applications in viral marketing, misinformation control, and content recommendation. However, information propagation mechanisms, user behavior, and temporal activity patterns exhibit significant diversity, necessitating a foundational model capable of adapting to such variations. At the same time, the amount of available cascade data remains relatively limited compared to the vast datasets used for training large language models (LLMs). Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging LLMs for time-series prediction by exploiting commonalities across different time-series domains. Building on this insight, we introduce the Autoregressive Information Cascade Predictor (AutoCas), an LLM-enhanced model designed specifically for cascade popularity prediction. Unlike natural language sequences, cascade data is characterized by complex local topologies, diffusion contexts, and evolving dynamics, requiring specialized adaptations for effective LLM integration. To address these challenges, we first tokenize cascade data to align it with sequence modeling principles. Next, we reformulate cascade diffusion as an autoregressive modeling task to fully harness the architectural strengths of LLMs. Beyond conventional approaches, we further introduce prompt learning to enhance the synergy between LLMs and cascade prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AutoCas significantly outperforms baseline models in cascade popularity prediction while exhibiting scaling behavior inherited from LLMs. Code is available at this repository:this https URL"
2502.18138,"The rise of echo chambers on social media platforms has heightened concerns about polarization and the reinforcement of existing beliefs. Traditional approaches for simulating echo chamber formation have often relied on predefined rules and numerical simulations, which, while insightful, may lack the nuance needed to capture complex, real-world interactions. In this paper, we present a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as generative agents to simulate echo chamber dynamics within social networks. The novelty of our approach is that it incorporates both opinion updates and network rewiring behaviors driven by LLMs, allowing for a context-aware and semantically rich simulation of social interactions. Additionally, we utilize real-world Twitter (now X) data to benchmark the LLM-based simulation against actual social media behaviors, providing insights into the accuracy and realism of the generated opinion trends. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of LLMs in modeling echo chamber formation, capturing both structural and semantic dimensions of opinion clustering. %This work contributes to a deeper understanding of social influence dynamics and offers a new tool for studying polarization in online communities."
2502.18155,"Recently, the influence of potentially present symmetries has begun to be studied in complex networks. A typical way of studying symmetries is via the automorphism group of the corresponding graph. Since complex networks are often subject to uncertainty and automorphisms are very sensitive to small changes, this characterization needs to be modified to an approximate version for successful application. This paper considers a recently introduced approximate symmetry of complex networks computed as an automorphism with acceptance of small edge preservation error, see Liu 2020. This problem is generally very hard with respect to the large space of candidate permutations, and hence the corresponding computation methods typically lead to the utilization of local algorithms such as the simulated annealing used in the original work. This paper proposes a new heuristic algorithm extending such iterative search algorithm method by using network centralities as heuristics. Centralities are shown to be a good tool to navigate the local search towards more appropriate permutations and lead to better search results."
2502.18497,"In this paper, we propose a novel parallel hierarchical Leiden-based algorithm for dynamic community detection. The algorithm, for a given batch update of edge insertions and deletions, partitions the network into communities using only a local neighborhood of the affected nodes. It also uses the inner hierarchical graph-based structure, which is updated incrementally in the process of optimizing the modularity of the partitioning. The algorithm has been extensively tested on various networks. The results demonstrate promising improvements in performance and scalability while maintaining the modularity of the partitioning."
2502.185,"In this study, we examine the role of Twitter as a first line of defense against misinformation by tracking the public engagement with, and the platforms response to, 500 tweets concerning the RussoUkrainian conflict which were identified as misinformation. Using a realtime sample of 543 475 of their retweets, we find that users who geolocate themselves in the U.S. both produce and consume the largest portion of misinformation, however accounts claiming to be in Ukraine are the second largest source. At the time of writing, 84% of these tweets were still available on the platform, especially those having an anti-Russia narrative. For those that did receive some sanctions, the retweeting rate has already stabilized, pointing to ineffectiveness of the measures to stem their spread. These findings point to the need for a change in the existing anti-misinformation system ecosystem. We propose several design and research guidelines for its possible improvement."
2502.18513,"While there is an increased discourse on large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, there is no comprehensive understanding of how users of online platforms, like Reddit, perceive these models. This is an important omission because public opinion can influence AI development, trust, and future policy. This study aims at analyzing Reddit discussions about ChatGPT and DeepSeek using sentiment and topic modeling to advance the understanding of user attitudes. Some of the significant topics such as trust in AI, user expectations, potential uses of the tools, reservations about AI biases, and ethical implications of their use are explored in this study. By examining these concerns, the study provides a sense of how public sentiment might shape the direction of AI development going forward. The report also mentions whether users have faith in the technology and what they see as its future. A word frequency approach is used to identify broad topics and sentiment trends. Also, topic modeling through the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method identifies top topics in users' language, for example, potential benefits of LLMs, their technological applications, and their overall social ramifications. The study aims to inform developers and policymakers by making it easier to see how users comprehend and experience these game-changing technologies."
2502.18579,"This study introduces an algorithm that generates undirected graphs with three main characteristics of real-world networks: scale-freeness, short distances between nodes (small-world phenomenon), and large clustering coefficients. The main idea is to perform random walks across the network and, at each iteration, add special edges with a decreasing probability to link more distant nodes, following a specific probability distribution. A key advantage of our algorithm is its simplicity and flexibility in creating networks with different characteristics without using global information about network topology. We show how the parameters can be adjusted to generate networks with specific average distances and clustering coefficients, maintaining a long-tailed degree distribution. The implementation of our algorithm is publicly available on a GitHub repository."
2502.18661,"We present TikTok StitchGraph: a collection of 36 graphs based on TikTok stitches. With its rapid growth and widespread popularity, TikTok presents a compelling platform for study, yet given its video-first nature the network structure of the conversations that it hosts remains largely unexplored. Leveraging its recently released APIs, in combination with web scraping, we construct graphs detailing stitch relations from both a video- and user-centric perspective. Specifically, we focus on user multi-digraphs, with vertices representing users and edges representing directed stitch relations. From the user graphs, we characterize common communication patterns of the stitch using frequent subgraph mining, finding a preference for stars and star-like structures, an aversion towards cyclic structures, and directional disposition favoring in- and out-stars over mixed-direction structures. These structures are augmented with sentiment labels in the form of edge attributes. We then use these subgraphs for graph-level embeddings together with Graph2Vec, we show no clear distinction between topologies for different hashtag topic categories. Lastly, we compare our StitchGraphs to Twitter reply networks and show that a remakable similarity between the conversation networks on the two platforms."
2502.1873,"Disasters impact communities through interconnected social, spatial, and physical networks. Analyzing network dynamics is crucial for understanding resilience and recovery. We highlight six studies demonstrating how hazards and recovery processes spread through these networks, revealing key phenomena, such as flood exposure, emergent social cohesion, and critical recovery multipliers. This network-centric approach can uncover vulnerabilities, inform interventions, and advance equitable resilience strategies in the face of escalating risks."
2502.1903,"Hypergraphs provide a fundamental framework for representing complex systems involving interactions among three or more entities. As empirical hypergraphs grow in size, characterizing their structural properties becomes increasingly challenging due to computational complexity and, in some cases, restricted access to complete data, requiring efficient sampling methods. Random walks offer a practical approach to hypergraph sampling, as they rely solely on local neighborhood information from nodes and hyperedges. In this study, we investigate methods for simultaneously sampling nodes and hyperedges via random walks on large hypergraphs. First, we compare three existing random walks in the context of hypergraph sampling and identify an advantage of the so-called higher-order random walk. Second, by extending an established technique for graphs to the case of hypergraphs, we present a non-backtracking variant of the higher-order random walk. We derive theoretical results on estimators based on the non-backtracking higher-order random walk and validate them through numerical simulations on large empirical hypergraphs. Third, we apply the non-backtracking higher-order random walk to a large hypergraph of co-authorships indexed in the OpenAlex database, where full access to the data is not readily available. Despite the relatively small sample size, our estimates largely align with previous findings on author productivity, team size, and the prevalence of open-access publications. Our findings contribute to the development of analysis methods for large hypergraphs, offering insights into sampling strategies and estimation techniques applicable to real-world complex systems."
2502.19098,"Understanding how opinions evolve is crucial for addressing issues such as polarization, radicalization, and consensus in social systems. While much research has focused on identifying factors influencing opinion change, the role of language and argumentative fallacies remains underexplored. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating how language - along with social dynamics - influences opinion evolution through LODAS, a Language-Driven Opinion Dynamics Model for Agent-Based Simulations. The model simulates debates around the ""Ship of Theseus"" paradox, in which agents with discrete opinions interact with each other and evolve their opinions by accepting, rejecting, or ignoring the arguments presented. We study three different scenarios: balanced, polarized, and unbalanced opinion distributions. Agreeableness and sycophancy emerge as two main characteristics of LLM agents, and consensus around the presented statement emerges almost in any setting. Moreover, such AI agents are often producers of fallacious arguments in the attempt of persuading their peers and - for their complacency - they are also highly influenced by arguments built on logical fallacies. These results highlight the potential of this framework not only for simulating social dynamics but also for exploring from another perspective biases and shortcomings of LLMs, which may impact their interactions with humans."
2502.19112,"Understanding students' emerging roles in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is critical for promoting regulated learning processes and supporting learning at both individual and group levels. However, it has been challenging to disentangle individual performance from group-based deliverables. This study introduces new learning analytic methods based on student -- subtask bipartite networks to gauge two conceptual dimensions -- quantity and heterogeneity of individual contribution to subtasks -- for understanding students' emerging roles in online collaborative learning in small groups. We analyzed these two dimensions and explored the changes of individual emerging roles within seven groups of high school students ($N = 21$) in two consecutive collaborative learning projects. We found a significant association in the changes between assigned leadership roles and changes in the identified emerging roles between the two projects, echoing the importance of externally facilitated regulation scaffolding in CSCL. We also collected qualitative data through a semi-structured interview to further validate the quantitative analysis results, which revealed that student perceptions of their emerging roles were consistent with the quantitative analysis results. This study contributes new learning analytic methods for collaboration analytics as well as a two-dimensional theoretical framework for understanding students' emerging roles in small group CSCL."
2502.19193,"Social media platforms frequently impose restrictive policies to moderate user content, prompting the emergence of creative evasion language strategies. This paper presents a multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the iterative evolution of language strategies under regulatory constraints. In this framework, participant agents, as social media users, continuously evolve their language expression, while supervisory agents emulate platform-level regulation by assessing policy violations. To achieve a more faithful simulation, we employ a dual design of language strategies (constraint and expression) to differentiate conflicting goals and utilize an LLM-driven GA (Genetic Algorithm) for the selection, mutation, and crossover of language strategies. The framework is evaluated using two distinct scenarios: an abstract password game and a realistic simulated illegal pet trade scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that as the number of dialogue rounds increases, both the number of uninterrupted dialogue turns and the accuracy of information transmission improve significantly. Furthermore, a user study with 40 participants validates the real-world relevance of the generated dialogues and strategies. Moreover, ablation studies validate the importance of the GA, emphasizing its contribution to long-term adaptability and improved overall results."
2502.1935,"Temporal networks, whose links are activated or deactivated over time, are used to represent complex systems such as social interactions or collaborations occurring at specific times. Such networks facilitate the spread of information and epidemics. The average number of nodes infected via a spreading process on a network starting from a single seed node over a given period is called the influence of that node. In this paper, we address the question of how to utilize the partially observed temporal network (local and of short duration) around each node, to estimate the ranking of nodes in spreading influence on the full network over a long period. This is essential for target marketing and epidemic/misinformation mitigation where only partial network information is possibly accessible. This would also enable us to understand which network properties of a node, observed locally and shortly after the start of the spreading process, determine its influence. We systematically propose a set of nodal centrality metrics based on partial temporal network information, encoding diverse properties of (time-respecting) walks. It is found that distinct centrality metrics perform the best in estimating nodal influence depending on the infection probability of the spreading process. For a broad range of the infection probability, a node tends to be influential if it can reach many distinct nodes via time-respecting walks and if these nodes can be reached early in time. We find and explain why the proposed metrics generally outperform classic centrality metrics derived from both full and partial temporal networks."
2502.19701,"The Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model of opinion dynamics describes how opinions held by individuals in a community change over time in response to the opinions of others and their access to the true value, T, to which these opinions relate. Here, I extend the simple HK model to incorporate an Artificially Intelligent (AI) Oracle that averages the opinions of members of the community. Agent-based simulations show that (1) if individuals only have access to the Oracle (and not T), and incorporate the Oracle's opinion as they update their opinions, then all opinions will converge on a common value; (2) in contrast, if all individuals also have access to T, then all opinions will ultimately converge to T, but the presence of an Oracle may delay the time to convergence; (3) if only some individuals have access to T, opinions may not converge to T, but under certain conditions, universal access to the Oracle will guarantee convergence to T; and (4) whether or not the Oracle only accesses the opinions of individuals who have access to T, or whether it accesses the opinions of everyone in the community, makes no marked difference to the extent to which the average opinion differs from T."
2502.19861,"Theoretical work on sequential choice and large-scale experiments in online ranking and voting systems has demonstrated that social influence can have a drastic impact on social and technological systems. Yet, the effect of social influence on online rating systems remains understudied and the few existing contributions suggest that online ratings would self-correct given enough users. Here, we propose a new framework for studying the effect of social influence on online ratings. We start from the assumption that people are influenced linearly by the observed average rating, but postulate that their propensity to be influenced varies. When the weight people assign to the observed average depends only on their own latent rating, the resulting system is linear, but the long-term rating may substantially deviate from the true mean rating. When the weight people put on the observed average depends on both their own latent rating and the observed average rating, the resulting system is non-linear, and may support multiple equilibria, suggesting that ratings might be path-dependent and deviations dramatic. Our results highlight potential limitations in crowdsourced information aggregation and can inform the design of more robust online rating systems."
2502.19895,"Community detection in network analysis has become more intricate due to the recent hike in social networks (Cai et al., 2024). This paper suggests a new approach named ELPMeans that strives to address this challenge. For community detection in the whole network, ELPMeans combines Laplacian, Hierarchical Clustering as well as K-means algorithms. Our technique employs Laplacian centrality and minimum distance metrics for central node identification while k-means learning is used for efficient convergence to final community structure. Remarkably, ELPMeans is an unsupervised method which is not only simple to implement but also effectively tackles common problems such as random initialization of central nodes, or finding of number of communities (K). Experimental results show that our algorithm improves accuracy and reduces time complexity considerably outperforming recent approaches on real world networks. Moreover, our approach has a wide applicability range in various community detection tasks even with nonconvex shapes and no prior knowledge about the number of communities present."
2502.19952,"Money laundering is the process that intends to legalize the income derived from illicit activities, thus facilitating their entry into the monetary flow of the economy without jeopardizing their source. It is crucial to identify such activities accurately and reliably in order to enforce anti-money laundering (AML). Despite considerable efforts to AML, a large number of such activities still go undetected. Rule-based methods were first introduced and are still widely used in current detection systems. With the rise of machine learning, graph-based learning methods have gained prominence in detecting illicit accounts through the analysis of money transfer graphs. Nevertheless, these methods generally assume that the transaction graph is centralized, whereas in practice, money laundering activities usually span multiple financial institutions. Due to regulatory, legal, commercial, and customer privacy concerns, institutions tend not to share data, restricting their utility in practical usage. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm that supports performing AML over multiple institutions while protecting the security and privacy of local data. To evaluate, we construct Alipay-ECB, a real-world dataset comprising digital transactions from Alipay, the world's largest mobile payment platform, alongside transactions from E-Commerce Bank (ECB). The dataset includes over 200 million accounts and 300 million transactions, covering both intra-institution transactions and those between Alipay and ECB. This makes it the largest real-world transaction graph available for analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods can effectively identify cross-institution money laundering subgroups. Additionally, experiments on synthetic datasets also demonstrate that our method is efficient, requiring only a few minutes on datasets with millions of transactions."
2502.20971,"The large amounts of data continuously generated online offer opportunities to identify and analyse trends in various aspects of society. For instance, data from online social media are frequently used as a means of analysing informal interactions, opinions, and feelings of groups of people. Additionally, bibliometric data can be used to investigate more formal trends that occur in scientific research. A popular approach to analysing such complex semi-structured data is the construction of complex networks based on keywords or concept extraction. However, such keyword-based complex network data are often shared in a preprocessed form, with little information about the underlying process used to construct it. Indeed, key decisions are normally made at an early stage in the construction of complex networks from raw data, and can have a significant impact on subsequent analysis and interpretation. In this paper, we highlight the sensitivity of results to data preprocessing decisions by looking at two different case studies which employ networks constructed from underlying semi-structured data. The experiments conducted show high sensitivity to data preprocessing for many commonly adopted metrics. These results demonstrate the need for transparent reporting of data lineage and preprocessing decisions."
2502.21037,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the proliferation of artificial agents in social contexts, ranging from education to online social media and financial markets, among many others. The increasing rate at which artificial and human agents interact makes it urgent to understand the consequences of human-machine interactions for the propagation of new ideas, products, and behaviors in society. Across two distinct empirical contexts, we find here that artificial agents lead to significantly faster and wider social contagion. To this end, we replicate a choice experiment previously conducted with human subjects by using artificial agents powered by large language models (LLMs). We use the experiment's results to measure the adoption thresholds of artificial agents and their impact on the spread of social contagion. We find that artificial agents tend to exhibit lower adoption thresholds than humans, which leads to wider network-based social contagions. Our findings suggest that the increased presence of artificial agents in real-world networks may accelerate behavioral shifts, potentially in unforeseen ways."
2503.00184,"We respond to Holst et al.'s (HATWG) critique that the observed decline in scientific disruptiveness demonstrated in Park et al. (PLF) stems from including works with zero backward citations (0-bcites). Applying their own advocated dataset, metric, and exclusion criteria, we demonstrate statistically and practically significant declines in disruptiveness that equal major benchmark transformations in science. Notably, we show that HATWG's own regression model -- designed specifically to address their concerns about 0-bcite works -- reveals highly significant declines for both papers (p<0.001) and patents (p<0.001), a finding they neither acknowledge nor interpret. Their critique is undermined by methodological deficiencies, including reliance on visual inspection without statistical assessment, and severe data quality issues in their SciSciNet dataset, which contains nearly three times more 0-bcite papers than our original data. HATWG's departure from established scientometric practices -- notably their inclusion of document types and fields known for poor metadata quality -- invalidates their conclusions. Monte Carlo simulations and additional analyses using multiple disruptiveness measures across datasets further validate the robustness of the declining trend. Our findings collectively demonstrate that the observed decline in disruptiveness is not an artifact of 0-bcite works but represents a substantive change in scientific and technological innovation patterns."
2503.00599,"Social media users and inauthentic accounts, such as bots, may coordinate in promoting their topics. Such topics may give the impression that they are organically popular among the public, even though they are astroturfing campaigns that are centrally managed. It is challenging to predict if a topic is organic or a coordinated campaign due to the lack of reliable ground truth. In this paper, we create such ground truth by detecting the campaigns promoted by ephemeral astroturfing attacks. These attacks push any topic to Twitter's (X) trends list by employing bots that tweet in a coordinated manner in a short period and then immediately delete their tweets. We manually curate a dataset of organic Twitter trends. We then create engagement networks out of these datasets which can serve as a challenging testbed for graph classification task to distinguish between campaigns and organic trends. Engagement networks consist of users as nodes and engagements as edges (retweets, replies, and quotes) between users. We release the engagement networks for 179 campaigns and 135 non-campaigns, and also provide finer-grain labels to characterize the type of the campaigns and non-campaigns. Our dataset, LEN (Large Engagement Networks), is available in the URL below. In comparison to traditional graph classification datasets, which are small with tens of nodes and hundreds of edges at most, graphs in LEN are larger. The average graph in LEN has ~11K nodes and ~23K edges. We show that state-of-the-art GNN methods give only mediocre results for campaign vs. non-campaign and campaign type classification on LEN. LEN offers a unique and challenging playfield for the graph classification problem. We believe that LEN will help advance the frontiers of graph classification techniques on large networks and also provide an interesting use case in terms of distinguishing coordinated campaigns and organic trends."
2503.00646,"Understanding propagation structures in graph diffusion processes, such as epidemic spread or misinformation diffusion, is a fundamental yet challenging problem. While existing methods primarily focus on source localization, they cannot reconstruct the underlying propagation trees i.e., ""who infected whom"", which are substantial for tracking the propagation pathways and investigate diffusion mechanisms. In this work, we propose Deep Identification of Propagation Trees (DIPT), a probabilistic framework that infers propagation trees from observed diffused states. DIPT models local influence strengths between nodes and leverages an alternating optimization strategy to jointly learn the diffusion mechanism and reconstruct the propagation structure. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DIPT in accurately reconstructing propagation trees."
2503.01038,"Context: X, formerly known as Twitter, is one of the largest social media platforms and has been widely used for communication during research conferences. While previous studies have examined how users engage with X during these events, limited research has focused on analyzing the content posted by computer science conferences. Objective: This study investigates how conferences from different areas of computer science perform on social media by analyzing their activity, follower engagement, and the content posted on X. Method: We collect posts from 22 computer science conferences and conduct statistical experiments to identify variations in content. Additionally, we perform a manual analysis of the top five posts for each engagement metric. Results: Our findings indicate statistically significant differences in category, sentiment, and post length across computer science conference posts. Among all engagement metrics, likes were the most common way users interacted with conference content. Conclusion: This study provides insights into the social media presence of computer science conferences, highlighting key differences in content, sentiment, and engagement patterns across different venues."
2503.01394,"The development of social media platforms has revolutionized the speed and manner in which information is disseminated, leading to both beneficial and detrimental effects on society. While these platforms facilitate rapid communication, they also accelerate the spread of rumors and extremist speech, impacting public perception and behavior significantly. This issue is particularly pronounced during election periods, where the influence of social media on election outcomes has become a matter of global concern. With the unprecedented number of elections in 2024, against this backdrop, the election ecosystem has encountered unprecedented challenges. This study addresses the urgent need for effective rumor detection on social media by proposing a novel method that combines semantic analysis with graph neural networks. We have meticulously collected a dataset from PolitiFact and Twitter, focusing on politically relevant rumors. Our approach involves semantic analysis using a fine-tuned BERT model to vectorize text content and construct a directed graph where tweets and comments are nodes, and interactions are edges. The core of our method is a graph neural network, SAGEWithEdgeAttention, which extends the GraphSAGE model by incorporating first-order differences as edge attributes and applying an attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. This innovative approach allows for the fine-grained analysis of the complex social network structure, improving rumor detection accuracy. The study concludes that our method significantly outperforms traditional content analysis and time-based models, offering a theoretically sound and practically efficient solution."
2503.01442,"Textual data from social platforms captures various aspects of mental health through discussions around and across issues, while users reach out for help and others sympathize and offer support. We propose a comprehensive framework that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI techniques to identify and assess mental health disorders, detect their severity, and create recommendations for behavior change and therapeutic interventions based on users' posts on Reddit.To classify the disorders, we use rule-based labeling methods as well as advanced pre-trained NLP models to extract nuanced semantic features from the data. We fine-tune domain-adapted and generic pre-trained NLP models based on predictions from specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve classification accuracy. Our hybrid approach combines the generalization capabilities of pre-trained models with the domain-specific insights captured by LLMs, providing an improved understanding of mental health discourse. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each model, offering valuable insights into their practical applicability.This research potentially facilitates early detection and personalized care to aid practitioners and aims to facilitate timely interventions and improve overall well-being, thereby contributing to the broader field of mental health surveillance and digital health analytics."
2503.02271,"Experiments in online platforms frequently suffer from network interference, in which a treatment applied to a given unit affects outcomes for other units connected via the platform. This SUTVA violation biases naive approaches to experiment design and estimation. A common solution is to reduce interference by clustering connected units, and randomizing treatments at the cluster level, typically followed by estimation using one of two extremes: either a simple difference-in-means (DM) estimator, which ignores remaining interference; or an unbiased Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator, which eliminates interference at great cost in variance. Even combined with clustered designs, this presents a limited set of achievable bias variance tradeoffs. We propose a new estimator, dubbed Differences-in-Neighbors (DN), designed explicitly to mitigate network interference. Compared to DM estimators, DN achieves bias second order in the magnitude of the interference effect, while its variance is exponentially smaller than that of HT estimators. When combined with clustered designs, DN offers improved bias-variance tradeoffs not achievable by existing approaches. Empirical evaluations on a large-scale social network and a city-level ride-sharing simulator demonstrate the superior performance of DN in experiments at practical scale."
2503.02488,"We introduce new centrality measures, called ksi-centrality and normalized ksi-centrality measure the importance of a node up to the importance of its neighbors. First, we show that normalized ksi-centrality can be rewritten in terms of the Laplacian matrix such that its expression is similar to the local clustering coefficient. After that we introduce average normalized ksi-coefficient and show that for a random Erdos-Renyi graph it is almost the same as average clustering coefficient. It also shows behavior similar to the clustering coefficient for the Windmill and Wheel graphs. Finally, we show that the distributions of ksi centrality and normalized ksi centrality distinguish networks based on real data from artificial networks, including the Watts-Strogatz, Barabasi-Albert and Boccaletti-Hwang-Latora small-world networks. Furthermore, we show the relationship between normalized ksi centrality and the average normalized ksi coefficient and the algebraic connectivity of the graph and the Chegeer number."
2503.02513,"We study the problem of efficiently approximating the \textit{effective resistance} (ER) on undirected graphs, where ER is a widely used node proximity measure with applications in graph spectral sparsification, multi-class graph clustering, network robustness analysis, graph machine learning, and more. Specifically, given any nodes $s$ and $t$ in an undirected graph $G$, we aim to efficiently estimate the ER value $R(s,t)$ between nodes $s$ and $t$, ensuring a small absolute error $\epsilon$. The previous best algorithm for this problem has a worst-case computational complexity of $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{L_{\max}^3}{\epsilon^2 d^2}\right)$, where the value of $L_{\max}$ depends on the mixing time of random walks on $G$, $d = \min\{d(s), d(t)\}$, and $d(s)$, $d(t)$ denote the degrees of nodes $s$ and $t$, respectively. We improve this complexity to $\tilde{O}\left(\min\left\{\frac{L_{\max}^{7/3}}{\epsilon^{2/3}}, \frac{L_{\max}^3}{\epsilon^2d^2}, mL_{\max}\right\}\right)$, achieving a theoretical improvement of $\tilde{O}\left(\max\left\{\frac{L_{\max}^{2/3}}{\epsilon^{4/3} d^2}, 1, \frac{L_{\max}^2}{\epsilon^2 d^2 m}\right\}\right)$ over previous results. Here, $m$ denotes the number of edges. Given that $L_{\max}$ is often very large in real-world networks (e.g., $L_{\max} > 10^4$), our improvement on $L_{\max}$ is significant, especially for real-world networks. We also conduct extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic graph datasets to empirically demonstrate the superiority of our method. The experimental results show that our method achieves a $10\times$ to $1000\times$ speedup in running time while maintaining the same absolute error compared to baseline methods."
2503.02886,"Building on recent work studying content in the online advertising ecosystem, including our own prior study of political ads on the web during the 2020 U.S. elections, we analyze political ad content appearing on websites leading up to and during the 2024 U.S. elections. Crawling a set of 745 news and media websites several times from three different U.S. locations (Atlanta, Seattle, and Los Angeles), we collect a dataset of over 15000 ads, including (at least) 315 political ads, and we analyze it quantitatively and qualitatively. Among our findings: a prevalence of clickbait political news ads, echoing prior work; a seemingly new emphasis (compared to 2020) on voting safety and eligibility ads, particularly in Atlanta; and non-election related political ads around the Israel-Palestine conflict, particularly in Seattle. We join prior work in calling for more oversight and transparency of political-related ads on the web. Our dataset is available atthis https URL."
2503.02887,"Digital networks have profoundly transformed the ways in which individuals interact, exchange information, and establish connections, leading to the emergence of phenomena such as virality, misinformation cascades, and online polarization. This review conducts a thorough examination of the micro-macro linkages within digital social networks, analyzing how individual actions like liking, sharing, and commenting coalesce into broader systemic patterns and how these interactions are influenced by algorithmic mediation. Utilizing a multidisciplinary literature base, this study explores the interaction among user behaviors, network structures, and platform algorithms that intensify biases, strengthen homophily, and foster echo chambers. We delve into crucial dynamics including the scalability's impact on weak tie propagation, the amplification effects on influencers, and the rise of digital inequalities, employing both theoretical and empirical approaches. By synthesizing insights from sociology, network theory, and computational social science, this paper underscores the necessity for novel frameworks that integrate algorithmic processes into established micro-macro models. The conclusion presents practical strategies aimed at promoting fairer digital networks through decentralized architectures, algorithmic fairness, and improved digital inclusion, tackling significant challenges such as polarization and misinformation within networked societies."
2503.02888,This study examines whether German X users would see politically balanced news feeds if they followed comparable leading politicians from each federal parliamentary party of Germany. We address this question using an algorithmic audit tool [1] and all publicly available posts published by 436 German politicians on X. We find that the default feed of X showed more content from far-right AfD than from other political parties. We analyze potential factors influencing feed content and the resulting political non-representativeness of X. Our findings suggest that engagement measures and unknown factors related to party affiliation contribute to the overrepresentation of extremes of the German political party spectrum in the default algorithmic feed of X.
2503.0289,"Cascading failures (CF) entail component breakdowns spreading through infrastructure networks, causing system-wide collapse. Predicting CFs is of great importance for infrastructure stability and urban function. Despite extensive research on CFs in single networks such as electricity and road networks, interdependencies among diverse infrastructures remain overlooked, and capturing intra-infrastructure CF dynamics amid complex evolutions poses challenges. To address these gaps, we introduce the \textbf{I}ntegrated \textbf{I}nterdependent \textbf{I}nfrastructure CF model ($I^3$), designed to capture CF dynamics both within and across infrastructures. $I^3$ employs a dual GAE with global pooling for intra-infrastructure dynamics and a heterogeneous graph for inter-infrastructure interactions. An initial node enhancement pre-training strategy mitigates GCN-induced over-smoothing. Experiments demonstrate $I^3$ achieves a 31.94\% in terms of AUC, 18.03\% in terms of Precision, 29.17\% in terms of Recall, 22.73\% in terms of F1-score boost in predicting infrastructure failures, and a 28.52\% reduction in terms of RMSE for cascade volume forecasts compared to leading models. It accurately pinpoints phase transitions in interconnected and singular networks, rectifying biases in models tailored for singular networks. Access the code atthis https URL."
2503.02901,"Networks can be highly complex systems with numerous interconnected components and interactions. Granular computing offers a framework to manage this complexity by decomposing networks into smaller, more manageable components, or granules. In this article, we introduce metric-based granular computing technique to study networks. This technique can be applied to the analysis of networks where granules can represent subsets of nodes or edges and their interactions can be studied at different levels of granularity. We model the network as an information system and investigate its granular structures using metric representation. We establish that the concepts of reducts in rough set theory and resolving sets in networks are equivalent. Through this equivalence, we present a novel approach for computing all the minimal resolving sets of these networks."
2503.03061,"We develop an approach to generate random graphs to a target level of assortativity by using copula structures in graphons. Unlike existing random graph generators, we do not use rewiring or binning approaches to generate the desired random graph. Instead, we connect Archimedean bivariate copulas to graphons in order to produce flexible models that can generate random graphs to target assortativity. We propose three models that use the copula distribution function, copula density function and their mixed tensor product to produce networks. We express the assortativity coefficient in terms of homomorphism densities. Establishing this relationship forges a connection between the parameter of the copula and the frequency of subgraphs in the generated network. Therefore, our method attains a desired the subgraph distribution as well as the target assortativity. We establish the homomorphism densities and assortativity coefficient for each of the models. Numerical examples demonstrate the ability of the proposed models to produce graphs with different levels of assortativity."
2503.03112,"The rapid proliferation of the Internet and the widespread adoption of social networks have significantly accelerated information dissemination. However, this transformation has introduced complexities in information capture and processing, posing substantial challenges for researchers and practitioners. Predicting the dissemination of topic-related information within social networks has thus become a critical research focus. This paper proposes a predictive model for topic dissemination in social networks by integrating multidimensional features derived from key dissemination characteristics. Specifically, we introduce two novel indicators, user relationship breadth and user authority, into the PageRank algorithm to quantify user influence more effectively. Additionally, we employ a Text-CNN model for sentiment classification, extracting sentiment features from textual content. Temporal embeddings of nodes are encoded using a Bi-LSTM model to capture temporal dynamics. Furthermore, we refine the measurement of user interaction traces with topics, replacing traditional topic view metrics with a more precise communication characteristics measure. Finally, we integrate the extracted multidimensional features using a Transformer model, significantly enhancing predictive performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms traditional machine learning and unimodal deep learning models in terms of FI-Score, AUC, and Recall, validating its effectiveness in predicting topic propagation within social networks."
2503.035,"The detection of controversial content in political discussions on the Internet is a critical challenge in maintaining healthy digital discourse. Unlike much of the existing literature that relies on synthetically balanced data, our work preserves the natural distribution of controversial and non-controversial posts. This real-world imbalance highlights a core challenge that needs to be addressed for practical deployment. Our study re-evaluates well-established methods for detecting controversial content. We curate our own dataset focusing on the Indian political context that preserves the natural distribution of controversial content, with only 12.9% of the posts in our dataset being controversial. This disparity reflects the true imbalance in real-world political discussions and highlights a critical limitation in the existing evaluation methods. Benchmarking on datasets that model data imbalance is vital for ensuring real-world applicability. Thus, in this work, (i) we release our dataset, with an emphasis on class imbalance, that focuses on the Indian political context, (ii) we evaluate existing methods from this domain on this dataset and demonstrate their limitations in the imbalanced setting, (iii) we introduce an intuitive metric to measure a model's robustness to class imbalance, (iv) we also incorporate ideas from the domain of Topological Data Analysis, specifically Persistent Homology, to curate features that provide richer representations of the data. Furthermore, we benchmark models trained with topological features against established baselines."
2503.03755,"Online public opinion is increasingly becoming a significant factor affecting the stability of the internet and society, particularly as the frequency of online public opinion crises has risen in recent years. Enhancing the capability for early warning of online public opinion crises is urgent. The most effective approach is to identify potential crises in their early stages and implement corresponding management measures. This study establishes a preliminary indicator system for online public opinion early warning, based on the principles of indicator system construction and the characteristics and evolution patterns of online public opinion. Subsequently, data-driven methodologies were employed to collect and preprocess public opinion indicator data. Utilizing grey relational analysis and the K-Means clustering algorithm, we classified online public opinion events into three levels: slight, warning, and severe. Furthermore, we constructed an online topic evolution model using the online Hierarchical Dirichlet Process model to analyze the thematic changes of online public opinion events across different warning levels. Finally, we developed an online public opinion early warning model using a Backpropagation (BP) neural network. The test results of early warning samples show that the model achieves high accuracy. Thus, in practical early warning applications, the BP neural network can be effectively utilized for predicting online public opinion events."
2503.03775,"Social bots have become widely known by users of social platforms. To prevent social bots from spreading harmful speech, many novel bot detections are proposed. However, with the evolution of social bots, detection methods struggle to give high-confidence answers for samples. This motivates us to quantify the uncertainty of the outputs, informing the confidence of the results. Therefore, we propose an uncertainty-aware bot detection method to inform the confidence and use the uncertainty score to pick a high-confidence decision from multiple views of a social network under different environments. Specifically, our proposed BotUmc uses LLM to extract information from tweets. Then, we construct a graph based on the extracted information, the original user information, and the user relationship and generate multiple views of the graph by causal interference. Lastly, an uncertainty loss is used to force the model to quantify the uncertainty of results and select the result with low uncertainty in one view as the final decision. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method."
2503.0416,"The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media poses significant risks, necessitating timely and accurate detection. However, existing methods struggle with unseen news due to their reliance on training data from past events and domains, leaving the challenge of detecting novel fake news largely unresolved. To address this, we identify biases in training data tied to specific domains and propose a debiasing solution FNDCD. Originating from causal analysis, FNDCD employs a reweighting strategy based on classification confidence and propagation structure regularization to reduce the influence of domain-specific biases, enhancing the detection of unseen fake news. Experiments on real-world datasets with non-overlapping news domains demonstrate FNDCD's effectiveness in improving generalization across domains."
2503.04446,"Social media popularity prediction task aims to predict the popularity of posts on social media platforms, which has a positive driving effect on application scenarios such as content optimization, digital marketing and online advertising. Though many studies have made significant progress, few of them pay much attention to the integration between popularity prediction with temporal alignment. In this paper, with exploring YouTube's multilingual and multi-modal content, we construct a new social media temporal popularity prediction benchmark, namely SMTPD, and suggest a baseline framework for temporal popularity prediction. Through data analysis and experiments, we verify that temporal alignment and early popularity play crucial roles in social media popularity prediction for not only deepening the understanding of temporal dynamics of popularity in social media but also offering a suggestion about developing more effective prediction models in this field.

2503.05502,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a mathematical model to determine invariant sets, set covering, orbits and, in particular, attractors in the set of tourism variables. Analysis was carried out based on an algorithm and applying an interpretation of chaos theory developed in the context of General Systems Theory and Big Data. Design/methodology/approach - Tourism is one of the most digitalized sectors of the economy, and social networks are an important source of data for information gathering. However, the high levels of redundant information on the Web and the appearance of contradictory opinions and facts produce undesirable effects that must be cross-checked against real data. This paper sets out the causal relationships associated with tourist flows to enable the formulation of appropriate strategies. Findings - The results can be applied to numerous cases, for example, in the analysis of tourist flows, these findings can be used to determine whether the behaviour of certain groups affects that of other groups, as well as analysing tourist behaviour in terms of the most relevant variables. Originality/value - The technique presented here breaks with the usual treatment of the tourism topics. Unlike statistical analyses that merely provide information on current data, the authors use orbit analysis to forecast, if attractors are found, the behaviour of tourist variables in the immediate future."
2503.05552,"We present an analysis of the dynamics of discussions in Twitter (before it became X) among supporters of various candidates in the 2022 French presidential election, and followers of different types of media. Our study demonstrates that we can automatically detect the synchronization of interest among different groups around specific topics at particular times.We introduce two complementary methods for constructing dynamic semantic networks, each with its own advantages. The growing aggregated network helps identify the reactivation of past topics, while the rolling window network is more sensitive to emerging discussions that, despite their significance, may appear suddenly and have a short lifespan. These two approaches offer distinct perspectives on the discussion landscape. Rather than choosing between them, we advocate for using both, as their comparison provides valuable insights at a relatively low computational and storage cost. Our findings confirm and quantify, on a larger scale and in an automatic, agnostic manner, observations previously made using more qualitative methods. We believed this work represents a step forward in developing methodologies to assess equity in information treatment, an obligation imposed by law on broadcasters that use broadcast spectrum frequencies in certain countries."
2503.05898,"We study a new formulation of the team-formation problem, where the goal is to form teams to work on a given set of tasks requiring different skills. Deviating from the classic problem setting where one is asking to cover all skills of each given task, we aim to cover as many skills as possible while also trying to minimize the maximum workload among the experts. We do this by combining penalization terms for the coverage and load constraints into one objective. We call the corresponding assignment problem $\texttt{Balanced-Coverage}$, and show that it is NP-hard. We also consider a variant of this problem, where the experts are organized into a graph, which encodes how well they work together. Utilizing such a coordination graph, we aim to find teams to assign to tasks such that each team's radius does not exceed a given threshold. We refer to this problem as $\texttt{Network-Balanced-Coverage}$. We develop a generic template algorithm for approximating both problems in polynomial time, and we show that our template algorithm for $\texttt{Balanced-Coverage}$ has provable guarantees. We describe a set of computational speedups that we can apply to our algorithms and make them scale for reasonably large datasets. From the practical point of view, we demonstrate how to efficiently tune the two parts of the objective and tailor their importance to a particular application. Our experiments with a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of our problem formulation as well as the efficiency of our algorithms in practice."
2503.06493,"Peer interaction and social roles have been important factors in students' academic performance. Recent work on what influences academic performance in Thailand has focused on the quality of a school, students' backgrounds, and students themselves. A few works have analyzed the correlation between social roles and students' academic achievement. Therefore, this study was designed to measure the social networks of Thai undergraduate students and analyze the relationship between their roles in social networks and academic outcomes. The data analysis was based on social network theory and permutation test. Social network theory was used to measure essential network characteristics and extract social roles. Four roles were extracted in a social network: central members, clique members, liaisons, and isolators, and analyzed a relationship between the roles and academic performance. Data was collected via questionnaires from 384 students and used to build two types of networks: friend networks and study-helper networks. A permutation test was used for statistical hypothesis testing. The results showed that 1) Being a central member positively correlates with academic performance in friend and study-helper networks. The correlation coefficients between the degree of being a central member and academic performance are also positive in all schools and both types of networks. 2) Being an isolator negatively correlates with academic performance in study-helper networks. These results indicate that a social network plays a vital role in academic performance. The results suggest that academic institutes should encourage the development of students' social networks and strengthen the networks so that students can exchange their knowledge easier and help each other in learning, leading to better academic performance."
2503.06579,"Whether citations can be objectively and reliably used to measure productivity and scientific quality of articles and researchers can, and should, be vigorously questioned. However, citations are widely used to estimate the productivity of researchers and institutions, effectively creating a 'grubby' motivation to be well-cited. We model citation growth, and this grubby interest using an agent-based model (ABM) of network growth. In this model, each new node (article) in a citation network is an autonomous agent that cites other nodes based on a 'citation personality' consisting of a composite bias for locality, preferential attachment, recency, and fitness. We ask whether strategic citation behavior (reference selection) by the author of a scientific article can boost subsequent citations to it. Our study suggests that fitness and, to a lesser extent, out_degree and locality effects are influential in capturing citations, which raises questions about similar effects in the real world."
2503.06591,"Since Granell et al. proposed a multiplex network for information and epidemic propagation, researchers have explored how information propagation affects epidemic dynamics. However, the role of individuals acquiring information through physical interactions has received relatively less attention. In this work, we introduce a novel source of information: physical layer information, and derive the epidemic outbreak threshold using the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA). Our simulation results indicate that the outbreak threshold derived from the MMCA is consistent with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation results, thereby confirming the accuracy of the theoretical model. Furthermore, we find that the physical-layer information effectively increases the population's awareness density and the infection threshold $\beta_c$, while reducing the population's infection density, thereby suppressing the spreading of the epidemic. Another interesting finding is that when the density of 2-simplex information is relatively high, the 2-simplex plays a role similar to pairwise interaction, significantly enhancing the population's awareness density and effectively preventing large-scale epidemic outbreaks. In addition, our model works equally well for cyber physical systems with similar interaction mechanisms, while we simulate and validate it in a real grid system."
2503.07068,"The ""Fediverse"", a federation of decentralized social media servers, has emerged after a decade in which centralized platforms like X (formerly Twitter) have dominated the landscape. The structure of a federation should affect user activity, as a user selects a server to access the Fediverse and posts are distributed along the structure. This paper reports on the differences in user activity between Twitter and Mastodon, a prominent example of decentralized social media. The target of the analysis is Japanese posts because both Twitter and Mastodon are actively used especially in Japan. Our findings include a larger number of replies on Twitter, more consistent user engagement onthis http URL, and different topic preferences on each server."
2503.07304,"Ontologies provide a systematic framework for organizing and leveraging knowledge, enabling smarter and more effective decision-making. In order to advance in the capitalization and augmentation of intelligence related to nowadays cyberoperations, the proposed Influence Operation Ontology (IOO) establishes the main entities and relationships to model offensive tactics and techniques by threat actors against the public audience through the information environment. It aims to stimulate research and development in the field, leading to innovative applications against influence operations, particularly in the fields of intelligence, security, and defense."
2503.07695,"On February 7, 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a two-hour interview with conservative political commentator, Tucker Carlson. This study investigated the impact of the Carlson- Putin interview on the US X audience. We proposed a framework of social media impact using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) by measuring changes in audience, structure, and content. Triangulation methods were used to validate the process and results. The interview had a considerable impact among segments of the American public: 1) the reach and engagement of far-right influencers increased after the interview, suggesting Kremlin narratives gained traction within these circles, 2) the communication structure became more vulnerable to disinformation spread after the interview, and 3) the public discourse changed from support for Ukraine funding to conversations about Putin, Russia, and the issue of ""truth"" or the veracity of Putin's claims. This research contributes to methods development for social media studies and aids scholars in analyzing how public opinion shapes policy debates. The Carlson-Putin interview sparked a broader discussion about truth-telling. Far from being muted, the broad impact of the interview appears considerable and poses challenges for foreign affairs leaders who depend on public support and buy-in when formulating national policy."
2503.07892,"Recovering from crises, such as hurricanes or wildfires, is a complex process that can take weeks, months, or even decades to overcome. Crises have both acute (immediate) and chronic (long-term) effects on communities. Crisis informatics research often focuses on the immediate response phase of disasters, thereby overlooking the long-term recovery phase, which is critical for understanding the information needs of users undergoing challenges like climate gentrification and housing inequity. We fill this gap by investigating community discourse over eight months following Hurricane Ida in an online neighborhood Facebook group and Town Hall Meetings of a borough in the New York Metropolitan region. Using a mixed methods approach, we examined the use of social media to manage long-term disaster recovery. The findings revealed a significant overlap in topics, underscoring the interconnected nature of online and offline community discourse, and illuminated themes related to the long-term consequences of disasters. We conclude with recommendations aimed at helping designers and government leaders enhance participation across community forums and support recovery in the aftermath of disasters."
2503.08456,"A novel network-based approach is introduced to analyze banking systems, focusing on two main themes: identifying influential nodes within global banking networks using Bank for International Settlements data and developing an algorithm to detect suspicious transactions for anti-money laundering. Leveraging the concept of adversarial networks, we examine Bank for International Settlements data to characterize low-key leaders and highly-exposed nodes in the context of financial contagion among countries. Low-key leaders are nodes with significant influence despite lower centrality, while highly-exposed nodes represent those most vulnerable to defaults. Separately, using anonymized transaction data from Rabobank, we design an anti-money laundering algorithm based on network partitioning via the Louvain method and cycle detection, identifying unreported transaction patterns indicative of potential money laundering. The findings provide insights into system-wide vulnerabilities and propose tools to address challenges in financial stability and regulatory compliance."
2503.0869,"This study conducts a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research on domination in graph theory from 1961 to 2024, based on Scopus-indexed publications retrieved using the query (dominating OR domination) AND graph. The analysis examines publication trends, key contributors, collaboration patterns, citation impact, and emerging research themes. Results indicate a significant and sustained increase in research output, particularly in recent decades. Henning, M.A., Hedetniemi, S.T., and Haynes, T.W. are identified as the most highly cited researchers, underscoring their foundational contributions to the field. Co-authorship network analysis reveals strong international collaborations, with Sheikhholeslami, S.M. exhibiting the highest total link strength, while the United States emerges as the leading hub for global research partnerships. Keyword co-occurrence analysis identifies four major research clusters: graph algorithms, graph-theoretic foundations, domination variants, and binary graph operations. Notably, recent studies increasingly focus on how domination properties evolve under different graph operations. Citation network analysis confirms the enduring influence of foundational studies while highlighting a shift towards computational and applied methodologies. These findings highlight the transition from theoretical to applied research, emphasizing the role of advanced algorithms, interdisciplinary approaches, and large-scale computational techniques. Future research directions should explore machine learning-based optimization, domination in evolving networks, and applications in cybersecurity, bioinformatics, and large-scale social networks."
2503.08709,"This paper introduces a simulator designed for opinion dynamics researchers to model competing influences within social networks in the presence of LLM-based agents. By integrating established opinion dynamics principles with state-of-the-art LLMs, this tool enables the study of influence propagation and counter-misinformation strategies. The simulator is particularly valuable for researchers in social science, psychology, and operations research, allowing them to analyse societal phenomena without requiring extensive coding expertise. Additionally, the simulator will be openly available on GitHub, ensuring accessibility and adaptability for those who wish to extend its capabilities for their own research."
2503.08743,"Hypergraph, which allows each hyperedge to encompass an arbitrary number of nodes, is a powerful tool for modeling multi-entity interactions. Hyperedge prediction is a fundamental task that aims to predict future hyperedges or identify existent but unobserved hyperedges based on those observed. In link prediction for simple graphs, most observed links are treated as positive samples, while all unobserved links are considered as negative samples. However, this full-sampling strategy is impractical for hyperedge prediction, due to the number of unobserved hyperedges in a hypergraph significantly exceeds the number of observed ones. Therefore, one has to utilize some negative sampling methods to generate negative samples, ensuring their quantity is comparable to that of positive samples. In current hyperedge prediction, randomly selecting negative samples is a routine practice. But through experimental analysis, we discover a critical limitation of random selecting that the generated negative samples are too easily distinguishable from positive samples. This leads to premature convergence of the model and reduces the accuracy of prediction. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel method to generate negative samples, named as hard negative sampling (HNS). Unlike traditional methods that construct negative hyperedges by selecting node sets from the original hypergraph, HNS directly synthesizes negative samples in the hyperedge embedding space, thereby generating more challenging and informative negative samples. Our results demonstrate that HNS significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness of the prediction. Moreover, as a plug-and-play technique, HNS can be easily applied in the training of various hyperedge prediction models based on representation learning."
2503.09281,"Accurate graph annotation typically requires substantial labeled data, which is often challenging and resource-intensive to obtain. In this paper, we present Crowdsourced Homophily Ties Based Graph Annotation via Large Language Model (CSA-LLM), a novel approach that combines the strengths of crowdsourced annotations with the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the graph annotation process. CSA-LLM harnesses the structural context of graph data by integrating information from 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors. By emphasizing homophily ties - key connections that signify similarity within the graph - CSA-LLM significantly improves the accuracy of annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that this method enhances the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by delivering more precise and reliable annotations."
2503.09526,"This paper examines the small-world properties of a Spotify artist feature collaboration network, focusing on clustering and diameter. We analyze the giant component and subgraphs based on genres, country-specific charts, and detected communities to assess their small-world characteristics. Results indicate that the network is scale-free and follows a power-law degree distribution, with highly popular artists serving as central hubs. Louvain community detection reveals distinct collaboration clusters aligned with genre-based and industry-driven connections. These findings offer insights into music recommendation systems and digital collaboration trends, contributing to a broader understanding of artist networks in the digital age."
2503.09585,"Here, we introduce a new tool for community detection, a generator of networks, which uses parameters to control the structure of created networks. Typically, network scientists designing novel community detection algorithms use synthetically generated benchmarks with community structures that they intend to detect and scale the benchmark networks across size and density. Currently, available benchmarks use generators limited to the properties of the LFR and GLFR networks. We improve on these previous benchmarks with a new hierarchical benchmark, the HGLFR, that preserves the properties of the LFR and GLFR while extending them to include heterogeneous inter-community connectivity. Networks generated by this benchmark are shown to produce networks with structures triggering the resolution limit while maintaining assortative connectivity."
2503.09626,"Social bot detection is crucial for mitigating misinformation, online manipulation, and coordinated inauthentic behavior. While existing neural network-based detectors perform well on benchmarks, they struggle with generalization due to distribution shifts across datasets and frequently produce overconfident predictions for out-of-distribution accounts beyond the training data. To address this, we introduce a novel Uncertainty Estimation for Social Bot Detection (UESBD) framework, which quantifies the predictive uncertainty of detectors beyond mere classification. For this task, we propose Robust Multi-modal Neural Processes (RMNP), which aims to enhance the robustness of multi-modal neural processes to modality inconsistencies caused by social bot camouflage. RMNP first learns unimodal representations through modality-specific encoders. Then, unimodal attentive neural processes are employed to encode the Gaussian distribution of unimodal latent variables. Furthermore, to avoid social bots stealing human features to camouflage themselves thus causing certain modalities to provide conflictive information, we introduce an evidential gating network to explicitly model the reliability of modalities. The joint latent distribution is learned through the generalized product of experts, which takes the reliability of each modality into consideration during fusion. The final prediction is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling of the joint latent distribution followed by a decoder. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show the effectiveness of RMNP in classification and uncertainty estimation, as well as its robustness to modality conflicts."
2503.09725,"Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) poses significant threats to the poultry industry, humans, domestic animals, and wildlife health worldwide. Monitoring this infectious disease is important for rapid and effective response to potential outbreaks. Conventional avian influenza surveillance systems have exhibited limitations in providing timely alerts for potential outbreaks. This study aimed to examine the idea of using online activity on social media, and Google searches to improve the identification of AIV in the early stage of an outbreak in a region. To this end, to evaluate the feasibility of this approach, we collected historical data on online user activities from X (formerly known as Twitter) and Google Trends and assessed the statistical correlation of activities in a region with the AIV outbreak officially reported case numbers. In order to mitigate the effect of the noisy content on the outbreak identification process, large language models were utilized to filter out the relevant online activity on X that could be indicative of an outbreak. Additionally, we conducted trend analysis on the selected internet-based data sources in terms of their timeliness and statistical significance in identifying AIV outbreaks. Moreover, we performed an ablation study using autoregressive forecasting models to identify the contribution of X and Google Trends in predicting AIV outbreaks. The experimental findings illustrate that online activity on social media and search engine trends can detect avian influenza outbreaks, providing alerts earlier compared to official reports. This study suggests that real-time analysis of social media outlets and Google search trends can be used in avian influenza outbreak early warning systems, supporting epidemiologists and animal health professionals in informed decision-making."
2503.09788,"This study examines the communication mechanisms that shape the formation of digitally-enabled mobilization networks. Informed by the logic of connective action, we postulate that the emergence of networks enabled by organizations and individuals is differentiated by network and framing mechanisms. From a case comparison within two mobilization networks -- one crowd-enabled and one organizationally-enabled -- of the 2011 Chilean student movement, we analyze their network structures and users' communication roles. We found that organizationally-enabled networks are likely to form from hierarchical cascades and crowd-enabled networks are likely to form from triadic closure mechanisms. Moreover, we found that organizations are essential for both kinds of networks: compared to individuals, organizations spread more messages among unconnected users, and organizations' messages are more likely to be spread. We discuss our findings in light of the network mechanisms and participation of organizations and influential users."
2503.1056,"Community-based fact-checking is a promising approach to address misinformation on social media at scale. However, an understanding of what makes community-created fact-checks helpful to users is still in its infancy. In this paper, we analyze the determinants of the helpfulness of community-created fact-checks. For this purpose, we draw upon a unique dataset of real-world community-created fact-checks and helpfulness ratings from X's (formerly Twitter) Community Notes platform. Our empirical analysis implies that the key determinant of helpfulness in community-based fact-checking is whether users provide links to external sources to underpin their assertions. On average, the odds for community-created fact-checks to be perceived as helpful are 2.70 times higher if they provide links to external sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the helpfulness of community-created fact-checks varies depending on their level of political bias. Here, we find that community-created fact-checks linking to high-bias sources (of either political side) are perceived as significantly less helpful. This suggests that the rating mechanism on the Community Notes platform successfully penalizes one-sidedness and politically motivated reasoning. These findings have important implications for social media platforms, which can utilize our results to optimize their community-based fact-checking systems."
2503.11845,"Long COVID continues to challenge public health by affecting a considerable number of individuals who have recovered from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection yet endure prolonged and often debilitating symptoms. Social media has emerged as a vital resource for those seeking real-time information, peer support, and validating their health concerns related to Long COVID. This paper examines recent works focusing on mining, analyzing, and interpreting user-generated content on social media platforms to capture the broader discourse on persistent post-COVID conditions. A novel transformer-based zero-shot learning approach serves as the foundation for classifying research papers in this area into four primary categories: Clinical or Symptom Characterization, Advanced NLP or Computational Methods, Policy Advocacy or Public Health Communication, and Online Communities and Social Support. This methodology achieved an average confidence of 0.7788, with the minimum and maximum confidence being 0.1566 and 0.9928, respectively. This model showcases the ability of advanced language models to categorize research papers without any training data or predefined classification labels, thus enabling a more rapid and scalable assessment of existing literature. This paper also highlights the multifaceted nature of Long COVID research by demonstrating how advanced computational techniques applied to social media conversations can reveal deeper insights into the experiences, symptoms, and narratives of individuals affected by Long COVID."
2503.11974,"Identifying influential node groups in complex networks is crucial for optimizing information dissemination, epidemic control, and viral marketing. However, traditional centrality-based methods often focus on individual nodes, resulting in overlapping influence zones and diminished collective effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, we propose Weighted Cycle (WCycle), a novel indicator that incorporates basic cycle structures and node behavior traits (edge weights) to comprehensively assess node importance. WCycle effectively identifies spatially dispersed and structurally diverse key node group, thereby reducing influence redundancy and enhancing network-wide propagation. Extensive experiments on six real-world networks demonstrate WCycle's superior performance compared to five benchmark methods across multiple evaluation dimensions, including influence propagation efficiency, structural differentiation, and cost-effectiveness. The findings highlight WCycle's robustness and scalability, establishing it as a promising tool for complex network analysis and practical applications requiring effective influence maximization."

However, as research deepens, the performance improvements in open-world link prediction have gradually reached a bottleneck. Understanding its intrinsic impact mechanisms is crucial for identifying the key factors that limit performance, offering new theoretical insights and optimization strategies to overcome these bottlenecks. This study focuses on entity degree distribution, a core structural feature of knowledge graphs, and investigates its impact on the performance of open-world link prediction tasks. First, through experimental analysis, we confirm that entity degree distribution significantly affects link prediction model performance. Second, we reveal a strong positive correlation between entity degree and link prediction accuracy. Moreover, this study explores how entity degree influences embedding space distribution and weight updates during neural network training, uncovering the deeper mechanisms affecting open-world link prediction performance. The findings show that entity degree distribution has a significant impact on model training. By influencing the quality of the embedding space and weight updates, it indirectly affects the overall prediction performance of the model. In summary, this study not only highlights the critical role of entity degree distribution in open-world link prediction but also uncovers the intrinsic mechanisms through which it impacts model performance, providing valuable insights and directions for future research in this field."
2503.12994,"Abusive behavior is common on online social networks, and forces the hosts of such platforms to find new solutions to address this problem. Various methods have been proposed to automate this task in the past decade. Most of them rely on the exchanged content, but ignore the structure and dynamics of the conversation, which could provide some relevant information. In this article, we propose to use representation learning methods to automatically produce embeddings of this textual content and of the conversational graphs depicting message exchanges. While the latter could be enhanced by including additional information on top of the raw conversational structure, no method currently exists to learn whole-graph representations using simultaneously edge directions, weights, signs, and vertex attributes. We propose two such methods to fill this gap in the literature. We experiment with 5 textual and 13 graph embedding methods, and apply them to a dataset of online messages annotated for abuse detection. Our best results achieve an F -measure of 81.02 using text alone and 80.61 using graphs alone. We also combine both modalities of information (text and graphs) through three fusion strategies, and show that this strongly improves abuse detection performance, increasing the F -measure to 87.06. Finally, we identify which specific engineered features are captured by the embedding methods under consideration. These features have clear interpretations and help explain what information the representation learning methods deem discriminative."
2503.13166,"Data is a valuable asset, and sharing it as a product across organizations is key to building comprehensive and useful insights in fields such as science and industry. Before sharing, data often requires transformation to comply with governance policies and meet the requirements of recipient organizations. By leveraging pipelines, these transformations can be modeled as chains of processes; however, designing such pipelines while ensuring their efficiency is complex. In this paper, we present a tool that supports the design of pipelines by identifying opportunities for reusing transformation processes across different pipelines and suggesting designs and configurations based on these opportunities. This tool also generates reports on the resource consumption of pipeline processes, enabling the estimation of potential resource savings achievable through reuse-based designs. It could serve as a foundation for more efficient and resource-conscious data transformation pipeline design and be used as a component in self-service data platforms."
2503.13405,"Invisible labor is an intrinsic part of the modern workplace, and includes labor that is undervalued or unrecognized such as creating collaborative atmospheres. Open source software (OSS) is software that is viewable, editable and shareable by anyone with internet access. Contributors are mostly volunteers, who participate for personal edification and because they believe in the spirit of OSS rather than for employment. Volunteerism often leads to high personnel turnover, poor maintenance and inconsistent project management. This in turn, leads to a difficulty with sustainability long term. We believe that the key to sustainable management is the invisible labor that occurs behind the scenes. It is unclear how OSS contributors think about the invisible labor they perform or how that affects OSS sustainability. We interviewed OSS contributors and asked them about their invisible labor contributions, leadership departure, membership turnover and sustainability. We found that invisible labor is responsible for good leadership, reducing contributor turnover, and creating legitimacy for the project as an organization."
2503.13635,"This study delves into the mechanisms that spark user curiosity driving active engagement within public Telegram groups. By analyzing approximately 6 million messages from 29,196 users across 409 groups, we identify and quantify the key factors that stimulate users to actively participate (i.e., send messages) in group discussions. These factors include social influence, novelty, complexity, uncertainty, and conflict, all measured through metrics derived from message sequences and user participation over time. After clustering the messages, we apply explainability techniques to assign meaningful labels to the clusters. This approach uncovers macro categories representing distinct curiosity stimulation profiles, each characterized by a unique combination of various stimuli. Social influence from peers and influencers drives engagement for some users, while for others, rare media types or a diverse range of senders and media sparks curiosity. Analyzing patterns, we found that user curiosity stimuli are mostly stable, but, as the time between the initial message increases, curiosity occasionally shifts. A graph-based analysis of influence networks reveals that users motivated by direct social influence tend to occupy more peripheral positions, while those who are not stimulated by any specific factors are often more central, potentially acting as initiators and conversation catalysts. These findings contribute to understanding information dissemination and spread processes on social media networks, potentially contributing to more effective communication strategies."
2503.14641,"In modern energy networks, where operational efficiency and resilience are critical, this study introduces an in-depth analysis from a multiplex network perspective - defined as a network where multiple types of connections exist between the same set of nodes. Utilizing Belgium's electricity and gas networks, we construct a five-layer multiplex network to simulate random node shutdown scenarios. We tailored the Jaccard and Adamic-Adar link prediction algorithms by integrating the concept of exclusive neighbors, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy with such multi-layered information. Emphasizing navigability, i.e., the network's ability to maintain resilience and efficiency under random failures, we analyze the impact of different random walk strategies and strategic link additions at various stages - individual layers, two-layer combinations, and three-layer combinations - on the network's navigability. Directed networks show modest improvements with new links, partly due to trapping effects, where a random walker can become circumscribed within certain network loops, limiting reachability across the network. In contrast, the undirected networks demonstrate notable increases in navigability with new link additions. Spectral gap analysis in directed networks indicates that new link additions can aid and impede navigability, depending on their configuration. This study deepens our understanding of multiplex energy network navigability and highlights the importance of strategic link additions influenced by random walk strategies in these networks."
2503.14765,"This paper makes four scientific contributions to the area of misinformation detection and analysis on digital platforms, with a specific focus on investigating how conspiracy theories, fake remedies, and false reports emerge, propagate, and shape public perceptions in the context of COVID-19. A dataset of 5,614 posts on the internet that contained misinformation about COVID-19 was used for this study. These posts were published in 2020 on 427 online sources (such as social media platforms, news channels, and online blogs) from 193 countries and in 49 languages. First, this paper presents a structured, three-tier analytical framework that investigates how multiple motives - including fear, politics, and profit - can lead to a misleading claim. Second, it emphasizes the importance of narrative structures, systematically identifying and quantifying the thematic elements that drive conspiracy theories, fake remedies, and false reports. Third, it presents a comprehensive analysis of different sources of misinformation, highlighting the varied roles played by individuals, state-based organizations, media outlets, and other sources. Finally, it discusses multiple potential implications of these findings for public policy and health communication, illustrating how insights gained from motive, narrative, and source analyses can guide more targeted interventions in the context of misinformation detection on digital platforms."
2503.14772,"What can we learn about online users by comparing their profiles across different platforms? We use the term profile to represent displayed personality traits, interests, and behavioral patterns (e.g., offensiveness). We also use the term {\it displayed personas} to refer to the personas that users manifest on a platform. Though individuals have a single real persona, it is not difficult to imagine that people can behave differently in different ``contexts'' as it happens in real life (e.g., behavior in office, bar, football game). The vast majority of previous studies have focused on profiling users on a single platform. Here, we propose VIKI, a systematic methodology for extracting and integrating the displayed personas of users across different social platforms. First, we extract multiple types of information, including displayed personality traits, interests, and offensiveness. Second, we evaluate, combine, and introduce methods to summarize and visualize cross-platform profiles. Finally, we evaluate VIKI on a dataset that spans three platforms -- GitHub, LinkedIn, and X. Our experiments show that displayed personas change significantly across platforms, with over 78% of users exhibiting a significant change. For instance, we find that neuroticism exhibits the largest absolute change. We also identify significant correlations between offensive behavior and displayed personality traits. Overall, we consider VIKI as an essential building block for systematic and nuanced profiling of users across platforms."
2503.1517,"Popularity dynamics in social media depend on a complex interplay of social influence between users and popularity-based recommendations that are provided by the platforms. In this work, we introduce a discrete-time dynamical system to model the evolution of popularity on social media. Our model generalizes the well-known Friedkin-Johnsen model to a set of influencers vying for popularity. We study the asymptotic behavior of this model and illustrate it with numerical examples. Our results highlight the interplay of social influence, past popularity, and content quality in determining the popularity of influencers."
2503.1572,"We explore the effects of coordinated users (i.e., users characterized by an unexpected, suspicious, or exceptional similarity) in information spreading on Twitter by quantifying the efficacy of their tactics in deceiving feed algorithms to maximize information outreach. In particular, we investigate the behavior of coordinated accounts within a large set of retweet-based information cascades identifying key differences between coordinated and non-coordinated accounts in terms of position within the cascade, action delay and outreach. On average, coordinated accounts occupy higher positions of the information cascade (i.e., closer to the root), spread messages faster and involve a slightly higher number of users. When considering cascade metrics such as size, number of edges and height, we observe clear differences among information cascades that are associated to a systematically larger proportion of coordinated accounts, as confirmed by comparisons with statistical null models. To further characterize the activity of coordinated accounts we introduce two new measures capturing their infectivity within the information cascade (i.e., their ability to involve other users) and their interaction with non-coordinated accounts. Finally, we find that the interaction pattern between the two classes of users follows a saturation-like process. A larger-scale targeting of non-coordinated users does not require a larger amount of coordinated accounts after a threshold value approximately 50%, after which involving more coordinated accounts within a cascade yields a null marginal effect. Our results contribute to shed light on the role of coordinated accounts and their effect on information diffusion."
2503.15788,"Interactive networks representing user participation and interactions in specific ""events"" are highly dynamic, with communities reflecting collective behaviors that evolve over time. Predicting these community evolutions is crucial for forecasting the trajectory of the related ""event"". Some models for community evolution prediction have been witnessed, but they primarily focused on coarse-grained evolution types (e.g., expand, dissolve, merge, split), often neglecting fine-grained evolution extents (e.g., the extent of community expansion). Furthermore, these models typically utilize only one network data (here is interactive network data) for dynamic community featurization, overlooking the more stable friendship network that represents the friendships between people to enrich community representations. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage model that predicts both the type and extent of community evolution. Our model unifies multi-class classification for evolution type and regression for evolution extent within a single framework and fuses data from both interactive and friendship networks for a comprehensive community featurization. We also introduce a hybrid strategy to differentiate between evolution types that are difficult to distinguish. Experimental results on three datasets show the significant superiority of the proposed model over other models, confirming its efficacy in predicting community evolution in interactive networks."
2503.16193,"This study investigates affective polarization among Swedish politicians on Twitter from 2021 to 2023, including the September 2022 parliamentary election. Analyzing over 25,000 tweets and employing large language models (LLMs) for sentiment and political classification, we distinguish between positive partisanship (support of allies) and negative partisanship (criticism of opponents).Our findings are contingent on the definition of the in-group. When political in-groups are defined at the ideological bloc level, negative and positive partisanship occur at similar rates. However, when the in-group is defined at the party level, negative partisanship becomes significantly more dominant and is 1.51 times more likely (1.45, 1.58). This effect is even stronger among extreme politicians, who engage in negativity more than their moderate counterparts. Negative partisanship also proves to be a strategic choice for online visibility, attracting 3.18 more likes and 1.69 more retweets on average.By adapting methods developed for two-party systems and leveraging LLMs for Swedish-language analysis, we provide novel insights into how multiparty politics shapes polarizing discourse. Our results underscore both the strategic appeal of negativity in digital spaces and the growing potential of LLMs for large-scale, non-English political research."
2503.1635,"Networks are essential for analyzing complex systems. However, their growing size necessitates backbone extraction techniques aimed at reducing their size while retaining critical features. In practice, selecting, implementing, and evaluating the most suitable backbone extraction method may be challenging. This paper introduces netbone, a Python package designed for assessing the performance of backbone extraction techniques in weighted networks. Its comparison framework is the standout feature of netbone. Indeed, the tool incorporates state-of-the-art backbone extraction techniques. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics allowing users to evaluate different backbones techniques. We illustrate the flexibility and effectiveness of netbone through the US air transportation network analysis. We compare the performance of different backbone extraction techniques using the evaluation metrics. We also show how users can integrate a new backbone extraction method into the comparison framework. netbone is publicly available as an open-source tool, ensuring its accessibility to researchers and practitioners. Promoting standardized evaluation practices contributes to the advancement of backbone extraction techniques and fosters reproducibility and comparability in research efforts. We anticipate that netbone will serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners enabling them to make informed decisions when selecting backbone extraction techniques to gain insights into the structural and functional properties of complex systems."
2503.16509,"A timely and effective response is crucial to minimize damage and save lives during natural disasters like earthquakes. Microblogging platforms, particularly Twitter, have emerged as valuable real-time information sources for such events. This work explores the potential of leveraging Twitter data for earthquake response analysis. We develop a machine learning (ML) framework by incorporating natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and analyze relevant information from tweets posted during earthquake events. The approach primarily focuses on extracting location data from tweets to identify affected areas, generating severity maps, and utilizing WebGIS to display valuable information. The insights gained from this analysis can aid emergency responders, government agencies, humanitarian organizations, and NGOs in enhancing their disaster response strategies and facilitating more efficient resource allocation during earthquake events."
2503.17026,"Climate change is one of the most critical challenges of the twenty-first century. Public understanding of climate issues and of the goals regarding the climate transition is essential to translate awareness into concrete actions. In this context, social media platforms play a crucial role in disseminating information about climate change and climate policy. To better understand the dynamics of information circulation and the emergence of information voids we propose a model that takes into account the supply and demand of information related to the Italian climate-transition discourse. We conceptualise information supply as the production of content on Facebook, Instagram and GDELT (an online news database) while leveraging Google searches to capture information demand. Our findings highlight responsiveness and temporal coupling between supply and demand, particularly during moments of heightened public attention triggered by significant external events. These responsive interactions reveal an overall adaptive information ecosystem. However, we also observe persistent information voids which may limit public understanding and delay meaningful engagement."
2503.17768,"Socio-psychological studies have identified a common phenomenon where an individual's public actions do not necessarily coincide with their private opinions, yet most existing models fail to capture the dynamic interplay between these two aspects. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel agent-based modeling framework that integrates opinion dynamics with a decision-making mechanism. More precisely, our framework generalizes the classical Hegselmann-Krause model by combining it with a utility maximization problem. Preliminary results from our model demonstrate that the degree of opinion-action divergence within a population can be effectively controlled by adjusting two key parameters that reflect agents' personality traits, while the presence of social network amplifies the divergence. In addition, we study the social diffusion process by introducing a small number of committed agents into the model, and identify three key outcomes: adoption of innovation, rejection of innovation, and the enforcement of unpopular norms, consistent with findings in socio-psychological literature. The strong relevance of the results to real-world phenomena highlights our framework's potential for future applications in understanding and predicting complex social behaviors."
2503.17843,"This study investigates the social dynamics of knowledge production in American sociology. Departing from traditional approaches focused on citations, co-authorship, and faculty hiring, we introduce a method capturing the dynamics of networks inferred from text to explore which ideas gain traction (a.k.a vogue). Drawing on sociology doctoral dissertations and journal abstracts, we trace the movement of word pairs between peripheral and core semantic networks to uncover dominant themes and methodological trajectories. Our findings demonstrate that regional location and institutional prestige play critical roles in shaping the production and adoption of research trends across 114 sociology PhD-granting institutions in the United States. We show that applied research topics, such as crime and health, despite being perceived as less prestigious than theoretically oriented subjects, serve as the primary driving force behind the emergence and diffusion of trends within the discipline. This work sheds light on the institutional mechanisms that govern knowledge production, demonstrating that sociology's intellectual landscape is not dictated by simple top-down diffusion from elite institutions but is instead structured by the contextual and institutional factors that facilitate specialization and segmentation."
2503.1818,"This study specifically investigates the initiation phase of EFL learners' engagement with AI tools, focusing on how technology acceptance constructs perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), and perceived self-efficacy (PSE) influence learning resilience. Drawing on an optimized Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and integrating constructs from positive psychology, the study examines the chain-mediated effects of learning motivation (LM) and metacognitive strategies (MS) on resilience outcomes, operationalized through optimism (OP), psychological resilience (PR), and growth mindset (GM). A survey of first-year English majors (N = 730) was conducted, and structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the data. The findings indicate that favorable perceptions of AI tools are significantly associated with enhanced LM and MS, which in turn positively impact resilience measures. These results suggest that the interplay between technology acceptance and internal regulatory processes is vital in shaping EFL learners' early experiences with AI-assisted learning. Practical implications for educators and researchers are discussed, with an emphasis on promoting user-friendly and effective AI environments to support the development of adaptive learning behaviors."
2503.18331,"Influence campaigns in online social networks are often run by organizations, political parties, and nation states to influence large audiences. These campaigns are employed through the use of agents in the network that share persuasive content. Yet, their impact might be minimal if the audiences remain unswayed, often due to the bounded confidence phenomenon, where only a narrow spectrum of viewpoints can influence them. Here we show that to persuade under bounded confidence, an agent must nudge its targets to gradually shift their opinions. Using a control theory approach, we show how to construct an agent's nudging policy under the bounded confidence opinion dynamics model and also how to select targets for multiple agents in an influence campaign on a social network. Simulations on real Twitter networks show that a multi-agent nudging policy can shift the mean opinion, decrease opinion polarization, or even increase it. We find that our nudging based policies outperform other common techniques that do not consider the bounded confidence effect. Finally, we show how to craft prompts for large language models, such as ChatGPT, to generate text-based content for real nudging policies. This illustrates the practical feasibility of our approach, allowing one to go from mathematical nudging policies to real social media content."
2503.18336,"Academic publishing is facing a crisis driven by exponential growth in submissions and an overwhelmed peer review system, leading to inconsistent decisions and a severe reviewer shortage. This paper introduces Panvas, a platform that reimagines academic publishing as a continuous, community-driven process. Panvas addresses these systemic failures with a novel combination of economic incentives (paid reviews) and rich interaction mechanisms (multi-dimensional ratings, threaded discussions, and expert-led reviews). By moving beyond the traditional accept/reject paradigm and integrating paper hosting with code/data repositories and social networking, Panvas fosters a meritocratic environment for scholarly communication and presents a radical rethinking of how we evaluate and disseminate scientific knowledge. We present the system design, development roadmap, and a user study plan to evaluate its effectiveness."
2503.18572,"Understanding human mobility is essential for applications ranging from urban planning to public health. Traditional mobility models such as flow networks and colocation matrices capture only pairwise interactions between discrete locations, overlooking higher-order relationships among locations (i.e., mobility flow among two or more locations). To address this, we propose co-visitation hypergraphs, a model that leverages temporal observation windows to extract group interactions between locations from individual mobility trajectory data. Using frequent pattern mining, our approach constructs hypergraphs that capture dynamic mobility behaviors across different spatial and temporal scales. We validate our method on a publicly available mobility dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in analyzing city-scale mobility patterns, detecting shifts during external disruptions such as extreme weather events, and examining how a location's connectivity (degree) relates to the number of points of interest (POIs) within it. Our results demonstrate that our hypergraph-based mobility analysis framework is a valuable tool with potential applications in diverse fields such as public health, disaster resilience, and urban planning."
2503.18823,"In this paper, we introduce ergodic sets, subsets of nodes of the networks that are dynamically disjoint from the rest of the network (i.e. that can never be reached or left following to the network dynamics). We connect their definition to purely structural considerations of the network and study some of their basic properties. We study numerically the presence of such structures in a number of synthetic network models and in classes of networks from a variety of real-world applications, and we use them to present a compression algorithm that preserve the random walk diffusive dynamics of the original network."
2503.18962,"Online comment sections, such as those on news sites or social media, have the potential to foster informal public deliberation, However, this potential is often undermined by the frequency of toxic or low-quality exchanges that occur in these settings. To combat this, platforms increasingly leverage algorithmic ranking to facilitate higher-quality discussions, e.g., by using civility classifiers or forms of prosocial ranking. Yet, these interventions may also inadvertently reduce the visibility of legitimate viewpoints, undermining another key aspect of deliberation: representation of diverse views. We seek to remedy this problem by introducing guarantees of representation into these methods. In particular, we adopt the notion of justified representation (JR) from the social choice literature and incorporate a JR constraint into the comment ranking setting. We find that enforcing JR leads to greater inclusion of diverse viewpoints while still being compatible with optimizing for user engagement or other measures of conversational quality."
2503.18978,"Almost equitable partitions (AEPs) have been linked to cluster synchronization in oscillatory systems, highlighting the importance of structure in collective network dynamics. We provide a general spectral framework that formalizes this connection, showing how eigenvectors associated with AEPs span a subspace of the Laplacian spectrum that governs partition-induced synchronization behavior. This offers a principled reduction of network dynamics, allowing clustered states to be understood in terms of quotient graph projections. Our approach clarifies the conditions under which transient hierarchical clustering and multi-frequency synchronization emerge, and connects these dynamical phenomena directly to network symmetry and community structure. In doing so, we bridge a critical gap between static topology and dynamic behavior-namely, the lack of a spectral method for analyzing synchronization in networks that exhibit exact or approximate structural regularity. Perfect AEPs are rare in real-world networks since most have some degree of irregularity or noise. We define a relaxation of an AEP we call a quasi-equitable partition at level $\delta$ ($\delta-$QEP). $\delta-$QEPs can preserve many of the clustering-relevant properties of AEPs while tolerating structural imperfections and noise. This extension enables us to describe synchronization behavior in more realistic scenarios, where ideal symmetries are rarely present. Our findings have important implications for understanding synchronization patterns in real-world networks, from neural circuits to power grids."
2503.19316,"Understanding the evolution of public opinion is crucial for informed decision-making in various domains, particularly public affairs. The rapid growth of social networks, such as Twitter (now rebranded as X), provides an unprecedented opportunity to analyze public opinion at scale without relying on traditional surveys. With the rise of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in modeling online opinion dynamics. Notably, classical opinion dynamics models, such as DeGroot, can be reformulated within a GNN framework.We introduce Latent Social Dynamical System (LSDS), a novel framework for modeling the latent dynamics of social media users' opinions based on textual content. Since expressed opinions may not fully reflect underlying beliefs, LSDS first encodes post content into latent representations. It then leverages a GraphODE framework, using a GNN-based ODE function to predict future opinions. A decoder subsequently utilizes these predicted latent opinions to perform downstream tasks, such as interaction prediction, which serve as benchmarks for model evaluation. Our framework is highly flexible, supporting various opinion dynamic models as ODE functions, provided they can be adapted into a GNN-based form. It also accommodates different encoder architectures and is compatible with diverse downstream tasks.To validate our approach, we constructed dynamic datasets from Twitter data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LSDS, highlighting its potential for future applications. We plan to publicly release our dataset and code upon the publication of this paper."
2503.19513,"This paper investigates the behavior of Reddit users who relied on alternative mobile apps, such as Apollo and RiF, before and after their forced shutdown by Reddit on July 1, 2023. The announcement of the shutdown led many observers to predict significant negative consequences, such as mass migration away from the platform. Using data from January to November 2023, we analyze user engagement and migration rates for users of these alternative clients before and after the forced discontinuation of their apps. We find that 22% of alternative client users permanently left Reddit as a result, and 45% of the users who openly threatened to leave if the changes were enacted followed through with their threats. Overall, we find that the shutdown of third-party apps had no discernible impact on overall platform activity. While the preceding protests were severe, ultimately for most users the cost of switching to the official client was likely far less than the effort required to switch to an entirely different platform. Scientific attention has increased to understand the contributing factors and effects of migration between online platforms, but real-world examples with available data remain rare. Our study addresses this by examining a large-scale online migratory movement."
2503.19573,"Motif counting plays a crucial role in understanding the structural properties of networks. By computing motif frequencies, researchers can draw key insights into the structural properties of the underlying network. As networks become increasingly complex, different graph models have been proposed, giving rise to diverse motif patterns. These variations introduce unique computational challenges that require specialized algorithms tailored to specific motifs within different graph structures. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured overview of motif counting techniques across general graphs, heterogeneous graphs, and hypergraphs. We categorize existing algorithms according to their underlying computational strategies, emphasizing key similarities and distinctions. In addition to reviewing current methodologies, we examine their strengths, limitations, and computational trade-offs. Furthermore, we explore future directions in motif counting, including scalable implementations to improve efficiency in large-scale networks, algorithmic adaptations for dynamic, temporal, and attributed graphs, and deeper integration with large language models (LLMs) and graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG). By offering a detailed analysis of these approaches, this survey aims to support researchers and practitioners in advancing motif counting for increasingly complex network data."
2503.19704,"Exploration of the impact of personality traits on social interactions within anonymous online communities poses a challenge at the interface of networked social sciences and psychology. We analyze whether Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types impact the dynamics of interactions on an anonymous chat system with over 288,000 messages from 6,076 users. Using a data set including 940 users voluntarily providing MBTI typing and gender, we create a weighted undirected network and apply network-science measures-such as assortativity, centrality measures, and community detection with the Louvain algorithm-to estimate the level of personality-based homophily and heterophily. Contrary to previous observations in structured social settings, our research shows a dominance of heterophilous interactions (89.3%), particularly among cognitively complementary types, i.e., NT (Intuitive-Thinking) and NF (Intuitive-Feeling). However, there is a moderate level of personality-based homophily (10.7%), notably among introverted intuitive personalities (e.g., INTJ, INFP, INFJ), reflecting an underlying cognitive alignment that persists regardless of identity markers. The interaction network exhibits scale-free properties with a power-law exponent of 1.45. In contrast, gender is a stronger homophily attribute, as evidenced by stronger levels of female users' group interactions compared with male users. While MBTI type influences minor interaction preferences, community structure exhibits low modularity (Q = 0.2584). The findings indicate that, in the absence of identity cues, psychological traits subtly shape online behavior, blending exploratory heterophily with subtle homophilic inclinations."
2503.19756,"While prior studies have examined the influence of information diffusion on epidemic dynamics, the role of affective polarisation--driven by digital media usage--remains less understood. This study introduces a mathematical framework to quantify the interplay between affective polarisation and epidemic spread, revealing contrasting effects depending on transmission rates. The model demonstrates that greater digital media influence leads to increased polarisation. Notably, the results reveal opposing trends: a negative correlation between polarisation and the infected population is observed when transmission rates are low, whereas a positive correlation emerges in high-transmission scenarios. These findings provide a quantitative foundation for assessing how digital media-driven polarisation may exacerbate health crises, informing future public health strategies."
2503.19802,"Tenet Media, a U.S.-based, right-wing media company, hired six established podcasters to create content related to U.S. politics and culture during the 2024 U.S. presidential election cycle. After publishing content on YouTube and Rumble for nearly a year, Tenet Media was declared by the U.S. government to be funded entirely by Russia -- making it effectively an outsourced state-sponsored information operation (SSIO). We present a complete dataset of the 560 podcast videos published by the Tenet Media channel on the video-sharing platform Rumble between November 2023 and September 2024. Our dataset includes video metadata and user comments, as well as high-quality video transcriptions, representing over 300 hours of video content. This dataset provides researchers with material to study a Russian SSIO, and notably on Rumble, which is an understudied platform in SSIO scholarship."
2503.19831,"Technological progress in the last few decades has granted an increasing number of people access to social media platforms such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram. Consequently, the potential risks associated with these services have also risen due to users exploiting these services for malicious purposes. The platforms have tools capable of detecting and blocking dangerous users, but they primarily focus on the content posted by users and usually overlook additional factors, such as the relationships among users. Another key aspect to consider is that users' beliefs and interests evolve over time. Therefore, a user who can be considered safe at one moment might later become malicious, and vice versa. This work describes a novel approach to node classification in temporal graphs, aimed at classifying users in social networks. The method was evaluated on a real-world scenario and was compared to a state-of-the-art system that treats the network as a static entity. Experiments showed that taking into account the temporal evolution of the network, in terms of node features and connections, is beneficial."
2503.19926,"Dynamic network embedding methods transform nodes in a dynamic network into low-dimensional vectors while preserving network characteristics, facilitating tasks such as node classification and community detection. Several embedding methods have been proposed to capture structural proximity among nodes in a network, where densely connected communities are preserved, while others have been proposed to preserve structural equivalence among nodes, capturing their structural roles regardless of their relative distance in the network. However, most existing methods that aim to preserve both network characteristics mainly focus on static networks and those designed for dynamic networks do not explicitly account for inter-snapshot structural properties. This paper proposes a novel unifying dynamic network embedding method that simultaneously preserves both structural proximity and equivalence while considering inter-snapshot structural relationships in a dynamic network. Specifically, to define structural equivalence in a dynamic network, we use temporal subgraphs, known as dynamic graphlets, to capture how a node's neighborhood structure evolves over time. We then introduce a temporal-structural random walk to flexibly sample time-respecting sequences of nodes, considering both their temporal proximity and similarity in evolving structures. The proposed method is evaluated using five real-world networks on node classification where it outperforms benchmark methods, showing its effectiveness and flexibility in capturing various aspects of a network."
2503.19927,"We present a comprehensive analysis of algebraic methods for controlling the stationary distribution of PageRank-like random walkers. Building upon existing literature, we compile and extend results regarding both structural control (through network modifications) and parametric control (through measure parameters) of these centralities. We characterize the conditions for complete control of centrality scores and the weaker notion of ranking control, establishing bounds for the required parameters. Our analysis includes classical PageRank alongside two generalizations: node-dependent dampings and node-dependent personalization vector, with the latter being a novel idea in the literature. We examine how their underlying random walk structures affect their controllability, and we also investigate the concepts of competitors and leaders in centrality rankings, providing insights into how parameter variations can influence node importance hierarchies. These results advance our understanding of the interplay between algebraic control and stochastic dynamics in network centrality measures."
2503.19928,"Background: Social determinants of health (SDoH) play a crucial role in influencing health outcomes, accounting for nearly 50% of modifiable health factors and bringing to light critical disparities among disadvantaged groups. Despite the significant impact of SDoH, existing data resources often fall short in terms of comprehensiveness, integration, and usability. Methods: To address these gaps, we developed an extensive Exposome database and a corresponding web application, aimed at enhancing data usability and integration with electronic health record (EHR) to foster personalized and informed healthcare. We created a robust database consisting of a wide array of SDoH indicators and an automated linkage tool designed to facilitate effortless integration with EHR. We emphasized a user-friendly interface to cater to researchers, clinicians, and public health professionals. Results: The resultant Exposome database and web application offer an extensive data catalog with enhanced usability features. The automated linkage tool has demonstrated efficiency in integrating SDoH data with EHRs, significantly improving data accessibility. Initial deployment has confirmed scalability and robust spatial data relationships, facilitating precise and contextually relevant healthcare insights. Conclusion: The development of an advanced Exposome database and linkage tool marks a significant step toward enhancing the accessibility and usability of SDoH data. By centralizing and integrating comprehensive SDoH indicators with EHRs, this tool empowers a wide range of users to access high-quality, standardized data. This resource will have a lasting impact on personalized healthcare and equitable health landscape."
2503.2003,"Short video streaming systems such as TikTok, Youtube Shorts, Instagram Reels, etc have reached billions of active users. At the core of such systems is a (proprietary) recommendation algorithm which recommends a sequence of videos to each user, in a personalized way. We aim to understand the temporal evolution of recommendations made by these algorithms and the interplay between the recommendations and user experience. While past work has studied recommendation algorithms using textual data (e.g., titles, hashtags, etc.) as well as user studies and interviews, we add a third modality of analysis - automated analysis of the videos themselves. Our content-based analysis framework leverages recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs). Together we use this trifecta of methodologies (analysis of user watch history and logs, user studies and interviews, and content-based analysis) to analyze challenging temporal aspects of how well TikTok's recommendation algorithm is received by users, is affected by user interactions, and aligns with user history; as well as how users are sensitive to the order of videos recommended, and how the algorithm's effectiveness itself may be predictable in the future. While it is not our goal to reverse-engineer TikTok's recommendation algorithm, our new findings indicate behavioral aspects that both users and algorithm developers would benefit from."
2503.20076,"Studying peer relationships is crucial in solving complex challenges underserved communities face and designing interventions. The effectiveness of such peer-based interventions relies on accurate network data regarding individual attributes and social influences. However, these datasets are often collected through self-reported surveys, introducing ambiguities in network construction. These ambiguities make it challenging to fully utilize the network data to understand the issues and to design the best interventions. We propose and solve two variations of link ambiguities in such network data -- (i) which among the two candidate links exists, and (ii) if a candidate link exists. We design a Graph Attention Network (GAT) that accounts for personal attributes and network relationships on real-world data with real and simulated ambiguities. We also demonstrate that by resolving these ambiguities, we improve network accuracy, and in turn, improve suicide risk prediction. We also uncover patterns using GNNExplainer to provide additional insights into vital features and relationships. This research demonstrates the potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to advance real-world network data analysis facilitating more effective peer interventions across various fields."
2503.20114,"The ongoing need for effective epidemic modeling has driven advancements in capturing the complex dynamics of infectious diseases. Traditional models, such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, and graph-based approaches often fail to account for higher-order interactions and the nuanced structure pattern inherent in human contact networks. This study introduces a novel Human Contact-Tracing Hypergraph Neural Network framework tailored for epidemic modeling called EpiDHGNN, leveraging the capabilities of hypergraphs to model intricate, higher-order relationships from both location and individual level. Both real-world and synthetic epidemic data are used to train and evaluate the model. Results demonstrate that EpiDHGNN consistently outperforms baseline models across various epidemic modeling tasks, such as source detection and forecast, by effectively capturing the higher-order interactions and preserving the complex structure of human interactions. This work underscores the potential of representing human contact data as hypergraphs and employing hypergraph-based methods to improve epidemic modeling, providing reliable insights for public health decision-making."
2503.20233,"Data analysts are essential in organizations, transforming raw data into insights that drive decision-making and strategy. This study explores how analysts' productivity evolves on a collaborative platform, focusing on two key learning activities: writing queries and viewing peer queries. While traditional research often assumes static models, where performance improves steadily with cumulative learning, such models fail to capture the dynamic nature of real-world learning. To address this, we propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that tracks how analysts transition between distinct learning states based on their participation in these activities.Using an industry dataset with 2,001 analysts and 79,797 queries, this study identifies three learning states: novice, intermediate, and advanced. Productivity increases as analysts advance to higher states, reflecting the cumulative benefits of learning. Writing queries benefits analysts across all states, with the largest gains observed for novices. Viewing peer queries supports novices but may hinder analysts in higher states due to cognitive overload or inefficiencies. Transitions between states are also uneven, with progression from intermediate to advanced being particularly challenging. This study advances understanding of into dynamic learning behavior of knowledge worker and offers practical implications for designing systems, optimizing training, enabling personalized learning, and fostering effective knowledge sharing."
2503.20299,"A $k$-clique is a dense graph, consisting of $k$ fully-connected nodes, that finds numerous applications, such as community detection and network analysis. In this paper, we study a new problem, that finds a maximum set of disjoint $k$-cliques in a given large real-world graph with a user-defined fixed number $k$, which can contribute to a good performance of teaming collaborative events in online games. However, this problem is NP-hard when $k \geq 3$, making it difficult to solve. To address that, we propose an efficient lightweight method that avoids significant overheads and achieves a $k$-approximation to the optimal, which is equipped with several optimization techniques, including the ordering method, degree estimation in the clique graph, and a lightweight implementation. Besides, to handle dynamic graphs that are widely seen in real-world social networks, we devise an efficient indexing method with careful swapping operations, leading to the efficient maintenance of a near-optimal result with frequent updates in the graph. In various experiments on several large graphs, our proposed approaches significantly outperform the competitors by up to 2 orders of magnitude in running time and 13.3\% in the number of computed disjoint $k$-cliques, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approaches in terms of efficiency and effectiveness."
2503.20488,"Given a graph $G$ and a seed node $v_s$, the objective of local graph clustering (LGC) is to identify a subgraph $C_s \in G$ (a.k.a. local cluster) surrounding $v_s$ in time roughly linear with the size of $C_s$. This approach yields personalized clusters without needing to access the entire graph, which makes it highly suitable for numerous applications involving large graphs. However, most existing solutions merely rely on the topological connectivity between nodes in $G$, rendering them vulnerable to missing or noisy links that are commonly present in real-world graphs.To address this issue, this paper resorts to leveraging the complementary nature of graph topology and node attributes to enhance local clustering quality. To effectively exploit the attribute information, we first formulate the LGC as an estimation of the bidirectional diffusion distribution (BDD), which is specialized for capturing the multi-hop affinity between nodes in the presence of attributes. Furthermore, we propose LACA, an efficient and effective approach for LGC that achieves superb empirical performance on multiple real datasets while maintaining strong locality. The core components of LACA include (i) a fast and theoretically-grounded preprocessing technique for node attributes, (ii) an adaptive algorithm for diffusing any vectors over $G$ with rigorous theoretical guarantees and expedited convergence, and (iii) an effective three-step scheme for BDD approximation. Extensive experiments, comparing 17 competitors on 8 real datasets, show that LACA outperforms all competitors in terms of result quality measured against ground truth local clusters, while also being up to orders of magnitude faster.

2503.20793,"The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a narrative of waves -- rising optimism followed by crashing disappointments. AI winters, such as the early 2000s, are often remembered as barren periods of innovation. This paper argues that such a perspective overlooks a crucial wave of AI that seems to be forgotten: the rise of the Semantic Web, which is based on knowledge representation, logic, and reasoning, and its interplay with intelligent Software Agents. Fast forward to today, and ChatGPT has reignited AI enthusiasm, built on deep learning and advanced neural models. However, before Large Language Models (LLMs) dominated the conversation, another ambitious vision emerged -- one where AI-driven Software Agents autonomously served Web users based on a structured, machine-interpretable Web. The Semantic Web aimed to transform the World Wide Web into an ecosystem where AI could reason, understand, and act. Between 2000 and 2010, this vision sparked a significant research boom, only to fade into obscurity as AI's mainstream narrative shifted elsewhere. Today, as LLMs edge toward autonomous execution, we revisit this overlooked wave. By analyzing its academic impact through bibliometric data, we highlight the Semantic Web's role in AI history and its untapped potential for modern Software Agent development. Recognizing this forgotten chapter not only deepens our understanding of AI's cyclical evolution but also offers key insights for integrating emerging technologies."
2503.21195,"This study presents a dual-mode interface design concept for social media platforms aimed at reducing social comparison in health-related content among Korean MZ (Millennials and Gen-Z) users. The proposed ""Inspiration"" and ""Reality"" modes allow users to toggle between curated, idealized posts and more realistic, candid content. This approach aims to alleviate negative psychological effects, such as decreased self-esteem and body dissatisfaction. The pre-study outlines the design framework and discusses potential implications for user satisfaction, perceived authenticity, and mental well-being."
2503.21225,"One of the most important challenges for improving personalized services in industries like tourism is predicting users' near-future movements based on prior behavior and current circumstances. Next POI (Point of Interest) recommendation is essential for helping users and service providers by providing personalized recommendations. The intricacy of this work, however, stems from the requirement to take into consideration several variables at once, such as user preferences, time contexts, and geographic locations. POI selection is also greatly influenced by elements like a POI's operational status during desired visit times, desirability for visiting during particular seasons, and its dynamic popularity over time. POI popularity is mostly determined by check-in frequency in recent studies, ignoring visitor volumes, operational constraints, and temporal dynamics. These restrictions result in recommendations that are less than ideal and do not take into account actual circumstances. We propose the Seasonal and Active hours-guided Graph-Enhanced Transformer (SEAGET) model as a solution to these problems. By integrating variations in the seasons, operational status, and temporal dynamics into a graph-enhanced transformer framework, SEAGET capitalizes on redefined POI popularity. This invention gives more accurate and context-aware next POI predictions, with potential applications for optimizing tourist experiences and enhancing location-based services in the tourism industry."
2503.21558,"Community detection, which identifies densely connected node clusters with sparse between-group links, is vital for analyzing network structure and function in real-world systems. Most existing community detection methods based on GCNs primarily focus on node-level information while overlooking community-level features, leading to performance limitations on large-scale networks. To address this issue, we propose LQ-GCN, an overlapping community detection model from a local community perspective. LQ-GCN employs a Bernoulli-Poisson model to construct a community affiliation matrix and form an end-to-end detection framework. By adopting local modularity as the objective function, the model incorporates local community information to enhance the quality and accuracy of clustering results. Additionally, the conventional GCNs architecture is optimized to improve the model capability in identifying overlapping communities in large-scale networks. Experimental results demonstrate that LQ-GCN achieves up to a 33% improvement in Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and a 26.3% improvement in Recall compared to baseline models across multiple real-world benchmark datasets."
2503.21953,"Individuals who shared actionable information during Hurricane Sandy were significantly more likely to exhibit risk-prone behavior, as measured by a novel Risk Behavior Quotient (RBQ). Using a dataset of 36595 geo-located tweets from 774 users in the New York area, we found that a higher proportion of actional tweets predicted increased exposure to physical even if overall users ultimately moved toward lower-risk zones. This counterintuitive finding suggests that proactivity, manifested in sharing crisis relevant content, correlates with greater exposure to risk, possibly due to increased mobility or engagement in hazardous areas. In contrast, a greater number of social media peers was associated with reduced risk exposure. This study builds on appraisal theory, which frames risk-related decisions as outcomes of cognitively mediated emotional and rational evaluations. We extend this theory to digital crisis behavior, distinguishing between emotional and actional appraisals expressed via social media. Tweets were categorized using sentiment analysis and semantic classification, enabling the isolation of affective and behavioral signals. Our methodology combines natural language processing with spatial vector analysis to estimate individual movement paths and risk exposure based on evacuation and flooding maps. The resulting RBQ captures both direction and intensity of risk behavior, allowing us to model how online communication reflects and predicts real-world risk engagement during natural disasters."
2503.22191,"The outbreak of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, causes major health crises worldwide. Typical measures to contain the rapid spread usually include effective vaccination and strict interventions (Nature Human Behaviour, 2021). Motivated by such circumstances, we study the problem of limiting the spread of a disease over a social network system.In their seminal work (KDD 2003), Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos introduced two fundamental diffusion models, the linear threshold and independent cascade, for the influence maximization problem. In this work, we adopt these models in the context of disease spreading and study effective vaccination mechanisms. Our broad goal is to limit the spread of a disease in human networks using only a limited number of vaccines. However, unlike the influence maximization problem, which typically does not require spatial awareness, disease spreading occurs in spatially structured population networks. Thus, standard Erdos-Renyi graphs do not adequately capture such networks. To address this, we study networks modeled as generalized random geometric graphs, introduced in the seminal work of Waxman (IEEE J. Sel. Areas Commun. 1988).We show that for disease spreading, the optimization function is neither submodular nor supermodular, in contrast to influence maximization, where the function is submodular. Despite this intractability, we develop novel algorithms leveraging local search and greedy techniques, which perform exceptionally well in practice. We compare them against an exact ILP-based approach to further demonstrate their robustness. Moreover, we introduce an iterative rounding mechanism for the relaxed LP formulation. Overall, our methods establish tight trade-offs between efficiency and approximation loss."
2503.22264,"Typically, for analysing and modelling social phenomena, networks are a convenient framework that allows for the representation of the interconnectivity of individuals. These networks are often considered transmission structures for processes that happen in society, e.g. diffusion of information, epidemics, and spread of influence. However, constructing a network can be challenging, as one needs to choose its type and parameters accurately. As a result, the outcomes of analysing dynamic processes often heavily depend on whether this step was done correctly. In this work, we advocate that it might be more beneficial to step down from the tedious process of building a network and base it on the level of the interactions instead. By taking this perspective, we can be closer to reality, and from the cognitive perspective, human beings are directly exposed to events, not networks. However, we can also draw a parallel to stream data mining, which brings a valuable apparatus for stream processing. Apart from taking the interaction stream perspective as a typical way in which we should study social phenomena, this work advocates that it is possible to map the concepts embodied in human nature and cognitive processes to the ones that occur in interaction streams. Exploiting this mapping can help reduce the diversity of problems that one can find in data stream processing for machine learning problems. Finally, we demonstrate one of the use cases in which the interaction stream perspective can be applied, namely, the social learning process."
2503.22584,"Researchers are no longer limited to producing knowledge; in today's complex world, they also address societal challenges by engaging in policymaking. Although involvement in policymaking has expanded, direct empirical evidence of its career benefits remains underexplored. Prior survey-based studies suggest potential advantages-such as broader professional networks and enhanced opportunities-yet raise concerns about insufficient institutional support. Here, we examine the 2021 WHO global air quality guideline-a science-based regulatory guideline-as a case study. To evaluate the impact of guideline development on research outcomes, we match guideline researchers with a control group of peers sharing similar research topics and prior performance. Our analysis reveals that guideline researchers attain higher future citation counts in both academic and policy domains. New collaborations formed during development yield publications with higher citation impact and the disruptive index. Moreover, about half the guideline's references are derived from guideline researchers' papers, highlighting their central role in shaping the evidence base. These results provide empirical support for the career benefits of policy engagement. Our findings indicate that engaging in international guideline development offers tangible career incentives for researchers, and that institutions can enhance research impact and promote innovative scientific progress by actively supporting their researchers' participation in such initiatives."
2503.22838,"This study presents a review of research on social media bot detection. Social media bots are used by political and criminal actors for mass distribution of political messages, as well as rumors, conspiracy theories, and other forms of false information. Through the spread of disinformation, bots are eroding the public trust in political and media institutions and integrity of social media. We have examined recent research publication in the field of social media bot detection, including several previous reviews of bot detection research, and identified the methods used in bot detection and issues encountered by researchers. Our review was conducted through a search of 5 main bibliographical databases, which has produced a total of 534 research papers and other publications. This collection was then filtered with exclusion and inclusion criteria to isolate the most pertinent documents, resulting in a focused selection of 49 documents that were analyzed for this review. In the first part of the paper we introduce the phenomenon of fake news within social networks, its connection with social media bot activity, and conclude the introduction with issues caused or exacerbated by bots. In the main part of this paper we first present the results of statistical analysis of the reviewed documents and then introduce the field of social media bot research, followed by an overview of the issues of social media bot detection identified in the reviewed literature, including the evolution of bot concealment techniques and the methodological issues presented in some of the bot detection studies. We then proceed with an overview of the methods and results from the reviewed research papers, structured according to the main methodology used in the examined studies. Our review concludes with examination of the recent trends in social media bot development and related bot detection research."
2503.23406,"Interdisciplinary research, a process of knowledge integration, is vital for scientific advancements. It remains unclear whether prestigious journals that are highly impactful lead in disseminating interdisciplinary knowledge. In this paper, by constructing topic-level correlation networks based on publications, we evaluated the interdisciplinarity of more and less prestigious journals in medicine. We found research from prestigious medical journals tends to be less interdisciplinary than research from other medical journals. We also established that cancer-related research is the main driver of interdisciplinarity in medical science. Our results indicate a weak tendency for differences in topic correlations between more and less prestigious journals to be co-located. Accordingly, we identified that interdisciplinarity in prestigious journals mainly differs from interdisciplinarity in other journals in areas such as infections, nervous system diseases and cancer. Overall, our results suggest that interdisciplinarity in science could benefit from prestigious journals easing rigid disciplinary boundaries."
2503.23432,"The title of this essay, Induced perversity, La perversidad inducida (in Spanish), refers to the side effects of sharing information on social media when it turns out to be false; or when judgments are made about people, events, companies, or facts that can produce effects often leading to consequences that were not initially foreseen. In digital environments, on the internet of linked data, harrassment politics and the cancellation culture are not isolated phenomena; they should be related to the evolution of the web, the emergence of the platform-driven economy, and the change of users' behaviour. Risks are not only a product of technology or the emergence of artificial intelligence. Ethical problems arise in a hybrid society, where the adaptation of human behavior to human-machine interaction (HMI), and the ethical, social, and legal ways of regulating them have yet to be learned.

2503.23713,"In an age where information spreads rapidly across social media, effectively identifying influential nodes in dynamic networks is critical. Traditional influence maximization strategies often fail to keep up with rapidly evolving relationships and structures, leading to missed opportunities and inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a novel learning-based approach integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) models. This hybrid framework captures both structural and temporal dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of candidate nodes for seed set selection. The bidirectional nature of BiLSTM allows our model to analyze patterns from both past and future network states, ensuring adaptability to changes over time. By dynamically adapting to graph evolution at each time snapshot, our approach improves seed set calculation efficiency, achieving an average of 90% accuracy in predicting potential seed nodes across diverse networks. This significantly reduces computational overhead by optimizing the number of nodes evaluated for seed selection. Our method is particularly effective in fields like viral marketing and social network analysis, where understanding temporal dynamics is crucial."
2503.24149,"As data is increasingly acknowledged as a highly valuable asset, much effort has been put into investigating inter-organisational data sharing, aiming at utilising the value of formerly unused data. Moreover, most researchers agree, that trust between actors is key for successful data sharing activities. However, existing research oftentimes focus on trust from a data provider perspective. Therefore, our work highlights the unbalanced view of trust, addressing it from a data consumer perspective. More specifically, our aim is to investigate trust enhancing measures on a data level, that is data trustworthiness. We found, that existing data trustworthiness enhancing solutions do not meet the requirements of the domain of inter-organisational data sharing. Therefore, our study addresses this gap. Conducting a rigorous design science research approach, this work proposes a new Levels of Assurance for Data Trustworthiness artifact. Built on existing artifacts, we demonstrate, how it addresses the identified challenges within the domain appropriately. We found that our novel approach requires more work to be suitable for adoption. Still, we are confident that our solution can increase consumer trust. We conclude by contributing to the body of design knowledge and emphasise the need for more attention to be put into consumer trust."
2504.00044,"Hashtag recommendation systems have emerged as a key tool for automatically suggesting relevant hashtags and enhancing content categorization and search. However, existing static models struggle to adapt to the highly dynamic nature of social media conversations, where new hashtags constantly emerge and existing ones undergo semantic shifts. To address these challenges, this paper introduces H-ADAPTS (Hashtag recommendAtion by Detecting and adAPting to Trend Shifts), a dynamic hashtag recommendation methodology that employs a trend-aware mechanism to detect shifts in hashtag usage-reflecting evolving trends and topics within social media conversations-and triggers efficient model adaptation based on a (small) set of recent posts. Additionally, the Apache Storm framework is leveraged to support scalable and fault-tolerant analysis of high-velocity social data, enabling the timely detection of trend shifts. Experimental results from two real-world case studies, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 US presidential election, demonstrate the effectiveness of H-ADAPTS in providing timely and relevant hashtag recommendations by adapting to emerging trends, significantly outperforming existing solutions."
2504.00071,"Decentralized online social networks have evolved from experimental stages to operating at unprecedented scale, with broader adoption and more active use than ever before. Platforms like Mastodon, Bluesky, Hive, and Nostr have seen notable growth, particularly following the wave of user migration after Twitter's acquisition in October 2022. As new platforms build upon earlier decentralization architectures and explore novel configurations, it becomes increasingly important to understand how these foundations shape both the direction and limitations of decentralization. Prior literature primarily focuses on specific architectures, resulting in fragmented views that overlook how different social networks encounter similar challenges and complement one another. This paper fills that gap by presenting a comprehensive view of the current decentralized online social network landscape. We examine four major architectures: federated, peer-to-peer, blockchain, and hybrid, tracing their evolution and evaluating how they support core social networking functions. By linking these architectural aspects to real-world cases, our work provides a foundation for understanding the societal implications of decentralized social platforms."
2504.00451,"Social Media Advertisement has emerged as an effective approach for promoting the brands of a commercial house. Hence, many of them have started using this medium to maximize the influence among the users and create a customer base. In recent times, several companies have emerged as Influence Provider who provides views of advertisement content depending on the budget provided by the commercial house. In this process, the influence provider tries to exploit the information diffusion phenomenon of a social network, and a limited number of highly influential users are chosen and activated initially. Due to diffusion phenomenon, the hope is that the advertisement content will reach a large number of people. Now, consider that a group of advertisers is approaching an influence provider with their respective budget and influence demand. Now, for any advertiser, if the influence provider provides more or less influence, it will be a loss for the influence provider. It is an important problem from the point of view of influence provider, as it is important to allocate the seed nodes to the advertisers so that the loss is minimized. In this paper, we study this problem, which we formally referred to as Regret Minimization in Social Media Advertisement Problem. We propose a noble regret model that captures the aggregated loss encountered by the influence provider while allocating the seed nodes. We have shown that this problem is a computationally hard problem to solve. We have proposed three efficient heuristic solutions to solve our problem, analyzed to understand their time and space requirements. They have been implemented with real world social network datasets, and several experiments have been conducted and compared to many baseline methods."
2504.00877,"The increasing polarization in democratic societies is an emergent outcome of political opinion dynamics. Yet, the fundamental mechanisms behind the formation of political opinions, from individual beliefs to collective consensus, remain unknown. Understanding that a causal mechanism must account for both bottom-up and top-down influences, we conceptualize political opinion dynamics as hierarchical coarse-graining, where microscale opinions integrate into a macro-scale state variable. Using the CODA (Continuous Opinions Discrete Actions) model, we simulate Bayesian opinion updating, social identity-based information integration, and migration between social identity groups to represent higher-level connectivity. This results in coarse-graining across micro, meso, and macro levels. Our findings show that higher-level connectivity shapes information integration, yielding three regimes: independent (disconnected, local convergence), parallel (fast, global convergence), and iterative (slow, stepwise convergence). In the iterative regime, low connectivity fosters transient diversity, indicating an informed consensus. In all regimes, time-scale separation leads to downward causation, where agents converge on the aggregate majority choice, driving consensus. Critically, any degree of coherent higher-level information integration can overcome misalignment via global downward causation. The results highlight how emergent properties of the causal mechanism, such as downward causation, are essential for consensus and may inform more precise investigations into polarized political discourse."
2504.01012,"Real-world networks grow over time; statistical models based on node exchangeability are not appropriate. Instead of constraining the structure of the \textit{distribution} of edges, we propose that the relevant symmetries refer to the \textit{causal structure} between them. We first enumerate the 96 causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) models over pairs of nodes (dyad variables) in a growing network with finite ancestral sets that are invariant to node deletion. We then partition them into 21 classes with ancestral sets that are closed under node marginalization. Several of these classes are remarkably amenable to distributed and asynchronous evaluation. As an example, we highlight a simple model that exhibits flexible power-law degree distributions and emergent phase transitions in sparsity, which we characterize analytically. With few parameters and much conditional independence, our proposed framework provides natural baseline models for causal inference in relational data."
2504.0117,"Traditional population estimation techniques often fail to capture the dynamic fluctuations inherent in urban and rural population movements. Recognizing the need for a high spatiotemporal dynamic population dataset, we propose a method using smartphone-based human mobility data to reconstruct the hourly population for each neighborhood across the US. We quantify population fluctuations on an hourly, diurnal, daily, and seasonal basis, and compare these with static population data to highlight the limitations of traditional models in capturing temporal dynamics. This study is one of the first hourly population products at a large geographic extent (US), contributing to various studies that involve dynamic populations with high spatiotemporal resolution, such as air pollution exposure analysis and emergency response."
2504.01712,"The expansion of the attention economy has led to the growing issue of inappropriate content being posted by profit-driven users. Previous countermeasures against inappropriate content have relied on moderation, which raises ethical concerns, or information diffusion control, which requires considering larger scale networks, including general users. This study proposes an imitation strategy as an intervention method that does not rely on moderation and focuses on a relatively smaller scale competitive network of information disseminators rather than the entire social network. The imitation strategy is a novel approach that utilizes increased competition among information disseminators through imitation to reduce attention to inappropriate content. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, I demonstrate that the imitation strategy is more effective when nodes with higher eigenvector centrality are selected as targets and nodes with lower eigenvector centrality are chosen as imitators."
2504.01718,"This paper proposes a dynamic epidemic model for successive opinion diffusion in social networks, extending the SHIMR model. It incorporates dynamic decision-making influenced by social distances and captures accumulative opinion diffusion caused by interrelated rumors. The model reflects the impact of rumor spread on social network structures. Simulations validate its effectiveness in explaining phenomena like the echo chamber effect and provide insights into opinion diffusion dynamics, with implications for understanding social polarization and network evolution."
2504.01979,"With the rise of social media and Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN), check-in data across platforms has become crucial for User Identity Linkage (UIL). These data not only reveal users' spatio-temporal information but also provide insights into their behavior patterns and interests. However, cross-platform identity linkage faces challenges like poor data quality, high sparsity, and noise interference, which hinder existing methods from extracting cross-platform user information. To address these issues, we propose a Correlation-Attention Masked Transformer for User Identity Linkage Network (MT-Link), a transformer-based framework to enhance model performance by learning spatio-temporal co-occurrence patterns of cross-platform users. Our model effectively captures spatio-temporal co-occurrence in cross-platform user check-in sequences. It employs a correlation attention mechanism to detect the spatio-temporal co-occurrence between user check-in sequences. Guided by attention weight maps, the model focuses on co-occurrence points while filtering out noise, ultimately improving classification performance. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 12.92%~17.76% and 5.80%~8.38% improvements in terms of Macro-F1 and Area Under Curve (AUC)."
2504.01982,"The last two years have seen significant changes in the divine pantheon of the Lost Omens campaign setting of the Pathfinder Tabletop Roleplaying Game. First, the Pathfinder Remaster, necessitated by the Open Game License debacle, prompted the removal of alignment and an enrichment of divine identities and relationships. Second, the War of Immortals, kicked off by the death of one of the core 20 deities, shook up the membership and relationships within the setting's primary pantheon. These two changes prompted the reprinting of deity information in Pathfinder: Lost Omens Divine Mysteries, which updates and replaces the pre-Remaster Pathfinder: Lost Omens Gods & Magic. Notably, Divine Mysteries features double the page count profiling the core 20 deities. In this paper, we use social network analysis to examine the impact of these changes (Remaster, War of Immortals, and page count) on the relationships among the core 20 deities. In this analysis, each deity features as a node, connected by edges that represent the number of times each pair of deities is mentioned in each other's profiles. The results reveal a much richer, more connected divine network in Divine Mysteries than in Gods & Magic. We conclude by discussing implications for the Lost Omens campaign setting and areas of future development."
2504.01991,"How do conspiracy theory communities in Latin America and the Caribbean structure, articulate, and sustain the dissemination of disinformation about autism? To answer this question, this research investigates the structuring, articulation, and promotion of autism-related disinformation in conspiracy theory communities in Latin America and the Caribbean. By analyzing publications from 1,659 Telegram communities over ten years (2015 - 2025) and examining more than 58 million pieces of shared content from approximately 5.3 million users, this study explores how false narratives about autism are promoted, including unfounded claims about its causes and promises of miraculous cures. The adopted methodology combines network analysis, time series analysis, thematic clustering, and content analysis, enabling the identification of dissemination patterns, key influencers, and interconnections with other conspiracy theories. Among the key findings, Brazilian communities stand out as the leading producers and distributors of these narratives in the region, accounting for 46% of the analyzed content. Additionally, there has been an exponential 15,000% (x151) increase in the volume of autism-related disinformation since the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America and the Caribbean, highlighting the correlation between health crises and the rise of conspiracy beliefs. The research also reveals that false cures, such as chlorine dioxide (CDS), ozone therapy, and extreme diets, are widely promoted within these communities and commercially exploited, often preying on desperate families in exchange for money. By addressing the research question, this study aims to contribute to the understanding of the disinformation ecosystem and proposes critical reflections on how to confront these harmful narratives."
2504.02153,"Online communities are important organizational forms where members socialize and share information. Curiously, different online communities often overlap considerably in topic and membership. Recent research has investigated competition and mutualism among overlapping online communities through the lens of organizational ecology; however, it has not accounted for how the nonlinear dynamics of online attention may lead to episodic competition and mutualism. Neither has it explored the origins of competition and mutualism in the processes by which online communities select or adapt to their niches. This paper presents a large-scale study of 8,806 Reddit communities belonging to 1,919 clusters of high user overlap over a 5-year period. The method uses nonlinear time series methods to infer bursty, often short-lived ecological dynamics. Results reveal that mutualism episodes are longer lived and slightly more frequent than competition episodes. Next, it tests whether online communities find their niches by specializing to avoid competition using panel regression models. It finds that competitive ecological interactions lead to decreasing topic and user overlaps; however, changes that decrease such niche overlaps do not lead to mutualism. The discussion proposes that future designs may enable online community ecosystem management by informing online community leaders to organize ""spin-off"" communities or via feeds and recommendations."
2504.02175,"Nascent research on human-computer interaction concerns itself with fairness of content moderation systems. Designing globally applicable content moderation systems requires considering historical, cultural, and socio-technical factors. Inspired by this line of work, we investigate Arab users' perception of Facebook's moderation practices. We collect a set of 448 deleted Arabic posts, and we ask Arab annotators to evaluate these posts based on (a) Facebook Community Standards (FBCS) and (b) their personal opinion. Each post was judged by 10 annotators to account for subjectivity. Our analysis shows a clear gap between the Arabs' understanding of the FBCS and how Facebook implements these standards. The study highlights a need for discussion on the moderation guidelines on social media platforms about who decides the moderation guidelines, how these guidelines are interpreted, and how well they represent the views of marginalised user communities."
2504.02615,"Node classification has gained significant importance in graph deep learning with real-world applications such as recommendation systems, drug discovery, and citation networks. Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Transformers have achieved superior performance in node classification tasks. However, the key concern with Graph Convolutional Networks is over-squashing, which limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies in the network. Additionally, Graph Transformers face scalability challenges, making it difficult to process large graphs efficiently. To address this, we propose a novel framework, A Hybrid SImilarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification (SIGNNet), which capitalizes on local and global structural information, enhances the model's capability to effectively capture fine-grained relationships and broader contextual patterns within the graph structure. The proposed method leverages Graph Convolutional Networks alongside a score-based mechanism to effectively capture local and global node interactions while addressing the limitations of over-squashing. Our proposed method employs a novel Personalized PageRank-based node sampling method to address scalability issues by generating subgraphs of nodes. Additionally, SIGNNet incorporates a novel attention mechanism, Structure-Aware Multi-Head Attention (SA-MHA), which integrates node structural information for informed attention weighting, enabling the model to prioritize nodes based on topological significance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods, with average accuracy gains of 6.03%, 5.47%, 4.78%, 19.10%, 19.61%, 7.22%, 19.54%, and 14.94% on Cora, Citeseer, CS, Wisconsin, Texas, Actor, Cornell and Chameleon datasets, respectively."
2504.02757,"The study of connectivity and coordination has drawn increasing attention in recent decades due to their central role in driving markets, shaping societal dynamics, and influencing biological systems. Traditionally, observable connections, such as phone calls, financial transactions, or social media connections, have been used to infer coordination and connectivity. However, incomplete, encrypted, or fragmented data, alongside the ubiquity of communication platforms and deliberate obfuscation, often leave many real-world connections hidden. In this study, we demonstrate that coordinating individuals exhibit shared bursty activity patterns, enabling their detection even when observable links between them are sparse or entirely absent. We further propose a generative model based on the network of networks formalism to account for the mechanisms driving this collaborative burstiness, attributing it to shock propagation across networks rather than isolated individual behavior. Model simulations demonstrate that when observable connection density is below 70\%, burstiness significantly improves coordination detection compared to state-of-the-art temporal and structural methods. This work provides a new perspective on community and coordination dynamics, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical detection. By laying the foundation for identifying hidden connections beyond observable network structures, it enables detection across different platforms, alongside enhancing system behavior understanding, informed decision-making, and risk mitigation."
2504.02853,"The volatility and unpredictability of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), generate significant uncertainty, which is widely discussed on social media. This study examines anticipatory discourse surrounding technological futures by analysing 1.5 million posts from 400 key opinion leaders (KOLs) published on the X platform (from 2021 to 2023). Using advanced text mining techniques, including BERTopic modelling, sentiment, emotion, and attitude analyses, the research identifies 100 distinct topics reflecting anticipated tech-driven futures. Our findings emphasize the dual role of KOLs in framing \textit{present futures} -- optimistic visions of transformative technologies like AI and IoT -- and influencing \textit{future presents}, where these projections shape contemporary societal and geopolitical debates. Positive emotions such as Hope dominate, outweighing Anxiety, particularly in topics like ``Machine Learning, Data Science, and Deep Learning,'' while discussions around ``Climate Change'' and ``War, Ukraine, and Trump People'' elicit \textit{Anxiety}. By framing technologies as solutions to societal challenges, KOLs act as mediators of societal narratives, bridging imagined futures and current realities. These insights underscore their pivotal role in directing public attention with emerging technologies during periods of heightened uncertainty, advancing our understanding of anticipatory discourse in technology-mediated contexts."
2504.02869,"The electoral system is a cornerstone of democracy, shaping the structure of political competition, representation, and accountability. In the case of France, it is difficult to access data describing elected representatives, though, as they are scattered across a number of sources, including public institutions, but also academic and individual efforts. This article presents a unified relational database that aims at tackling this issue by gathering information regarding representatives elected in France over the whole Fifth Republic (1958-present). This database constitutes an unprecedented resource for analyzing the evolution of political representation in France, exploring trends in party system dynamics, gender equality, and the professionalization of politics. By providing a longitudinal view of French elected representatives, the database facilitates research on the institutional stability of the Fifth Republic, offering insights into the factors of political change."
2504.02889,"Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is a technique that enhances knowledge graphs by addressing incompleteness and improving knowledge retrieval. A limitation of the existing KGE models is their underutilization of ontologies, specifically the relationships between properties. This study proposes a KGE model, TransU, designed for knowledge graphs with well-defined ontologies that incorporate relationships between properties. The model treats properties as a subset of entities, enabling a unified representation. We present experimental results using a standard dataset and a practical dataset."
2504.03119,"Human mobility analysis at urban-scale requires models to represent the complex nature of human movements, which in turn are affected by accessibility to nearby points of interest, underlying socioeconomic factors of a place, and local transport choices for people living in a geographic region. In this work, we represent human mobility and the associated flow of movements as a grapyh. Graph-based approaches for mobility analysis are still in their early stages of adoption and are actively being researched. The challenges of graph-based mobility analysis are multifaceted - the lack of sufficiently high-quality data to represent flows at high spatial and teporal resolution whereas, limited computational resources to translate large voluments of mobility data into a network structure, and scaling issues inherent in graph models etc. The current study develops a methodology by embedding graphs into a continuous space, which alleviates issues related to fast graph matching, graph time-series modeling, and visualization of mobility dynamics. Through experiments, we demonstrate how mobility data collected from taxicab trajectories could be transformed into network structures and patterns of mobility flow changes, and can be used for downstream tasks reporting approx 40% decrease in error on average in matched graphs vs unmatched ones."
2504.04472,"Derived from effective resistances, the current flow closeness centrality (CFCC) for a group of nodes measures the importance of node groups in an undirected graph with $n$ nodes. Given the widespread applications of identifying crucial nodes, we investigate the problem of maximizing CFCC for a node group $S$ subject to the cardinality constraint $|S|=k\ll n$. Despite the proven NP-hardness of this problem, we propose two novel greedy algorithms for its solution. Our algorithms are based on spanning forest sampling and Schur complement, which exhibit nearly linear time complexities and achieve an approximation factor of $1-\frac{k}{k-1}\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}}-\epsilon$ for any $0<\epsilon<1$. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs illustrate that our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art method in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, scaling to graphs with millions of nodes."
2504.05029,"Recently, diffusion-based recommendation methods have achieved impressive results. However, existing approaches predominantly treat each user's historical interactions as independent training samples, overlooking the potential of higher-order collaborative signals between users and items. Such signals, which encapsulate richer and more nuanced relationships, can be naturally captured using graph-based data structures. To address this limitation, we extend diffusion-based recommendation methods to the graph domain by directly modeling user-item bipartite graphs with diffusion models. This enables better modeling of the higher-order connectivity inherent in complex interaction dynamics. However, this extension introduces two primary challenges: (1) Noise Heterogeneity, where interactions are influenced by various forms of continuous and discrete noise, and (2) Relation Explosion, referring to the high computational costs of processing large-scale graphs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Graph-based Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering (GDMCF). To address noise heterogeneity, we introduce a multi-level noise corruption mechanism that integrates both continuous and discrete noise, effectively simulating real-world interaction complexities. To mitigate relation explosion, we design a user-active guided diffusion process that selectively focuses on the most meaningful edges and active users, reducing inference costs while preserving the graph's topological integrity. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GDMCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing higher-order collaborative signals and improving recommendation performance."
2504.05183,"Social networks may contain privacy-sensitive information about individuals. The objective of the network anonymization problem is to alter a given social network dataset such that the number of anonymous nodes in the social graph is maximized. Here, a node is anonymous if it does not have a unique surrounding network structure. At the same time, the aim is to ensure data utility, i.e., preserve topological network properties and retain good performance on downstream network analysis tasks. We propose two versions of a genetic algorithm tailored to this problem: one generic GA and a uniqueness-aware GA (UGA). The latter aims to target edges more effectively during mutation by avoiding edges connected to already anonymous nodes. After hyperparameter tuning, we compare the two GAs against two existing baseline algorithms on several real-world network datasets. Results show that the proposed genetic algorithms manage to anonymize on average 14 times more nodes than the best baseline algorithm. Additionally, data utility experiments demonstrate how the UGA requires fewer edge deletions, and how our GAs and the baselines retain performance on downstream tasks equally well. Overall, our results suggest that genetic algorithms are a promising approach for finding solutions to the network anonymization problem."
2504.06318,"Sociality borne by language, as is the predominant digital trace on text-based social media platforms, harbours the raw material for exploring multiple social phenomena. Distinctively, the messaging service Telegram provides functionalities that allow for socially interactive as well as one-to-many communication. Our Telegram dataset contains over 6,000 groups and channels, 40 million text messages, and over 3 million transcribed audio files, originating from a data-hoarding initiative named the ``Schwurbelarchiv'' (from German schwurbeln: speaking nonsense). This dataset publication details the structure, scope, and methodological specifics of the Schwurbelarchiv, emphasising its relevance for further research on the German-language conspiracy theory discourse. We validate its predominantly German origin by linguistic and temporal markers and situate it within the context of similar datasets. We describe process and extent of the transcription of multimedia files. Thanks to this effort the dataset uniquely supports multimodal analysis of online social dynamics and content dissemination. Researchers can employ this resource to explore societal dynamics in misinformation, political extremism, opinion adaptation, and social network structures on Telegram. The Schwurbelarchiv thus offers unprecedented opportunities for investigations into digital communication and its societal implications."
2504.06485,"As an epistemic activity, rational debate and discussion requires cooperation, yet involves a tension between collective and individual interests. While all participants benefit from collective outcomes like reaching consensus on true beliefs, individuals face personal costs when changing their minds. This creates an incentive for each debater to let others bear the cognitive burden of exploring alternative perspectives. We present a model to examine the strategic dynamics between debaters motivated by two competing goals: discovering truth and minimizing belief revisions. Our model demonstrates that this tension creates social dilemmas where strategies that are optimal for individuals systematically undermine the collective pursuit of truth. Paradoxically, our analysis reveals that increasing debaters' motivation to seek truth can sometimes produce equilibria with worse outcomes for collective truth discovery. These findings illuminate why rational debate can fail to achieve optimal epistemic outcomes, even when participants genuinely value truth."
2504.06894,"Extended connectivity in graphs can be analyzed through k-path Laplacian matrices, which permit the capture of long-range interactions in various real-world networked systems such as social, transportation, and multi-agent networks. In this work, we present several alternative methods based on machine learning methods (LSTM, xLSTM, Transformer, XGBoost, and ConvLSTM) to predict the final consensus value based on directed networks (Erdös-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, and Barabási-Albert) and on the initial state. We highlight how different k-hop interactions affect the performance of the tested methods. This framework opens new avenues for analyzing multi-scale diffusion processes in large-scale, complex networks."
2504.0748,"Public discourse and opinions stem from multiple social groups. Each group has beliefs about a topic (such as vaccination, abortion, gay marriage, etc.), and opinions are exchanged and blended to produce consensus. A particular measure of interest corresponds to measuring the influence of each group on the consensus and the disparity between groups on the extent to which they influence the consensus. In this paper, we study and give provable algorithms for optimizing the disparity under the DeGroot or the Friedkin-Johnsen models of opinion dynamics. Our findings provide simple poly-time algorithms to optimize disparity for most cases, fully characterize the instances that optimize disparity, and show how simple interventions such as contracting vertices or adding links affect disparity. Finally, we test our developed algorithms in a variety of real-world datasets."
2504.07848,"Understanding the emergence of inequality in complex systems requires attention to both structural dynamics and intrinsic heterogeneity. In the context of opinion dynamics, traditional models relied on static snapshots or assumed homogeneous agent behavior, overlooking how diverse cognitive dispositions shape belief evolution. While some recent models introduce behavioral heterogeneity, they typically focus on macro-level patterns, neglecting the unequal and individualized dynamics that unfold at the agent level. In this study, we analyze an adaptive social network model where each agent exhibits one of three behavioral tendencies-homophily, neophily (attention to novelty), or social conformity-and measure the complexity of individual opinion trajectories using normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. We find that the resulting dynamics are often counterintuitive-homophilic agents, despite seeking similarity, become increasingly unpredictable; neophilic agents, despite pursuing novelty, stabilize; and conformic agents follow a U-shaped trajectory, transitioning from early stability to later unpredictability. More fundamentally, these patterns remain robust across diverse network settings, showing that internal behavioral dispositions - not external environment - primarily govern long-term opinion unpredictability. The broader implication is that individuals' experiences of ideological volatility, uncertainty, or stability are not merely environmental, but endogenously self-structured through their own cognitive tendencies. These results establish a novel individual-level lens on opinion dynamics, where the behavioral identity of agents serves as a dynamical fingerprint in the evolution of belief systems, and gives rise to persistent disparities in dynamical experience within self-organizing social systems, even in structurally similar environments."
2504.08044,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a leading health problem that affects individual well-being as well as general public health. Due to a variety of reasons, including the stigma faced by people using opioids, online communities for recovery and support were formed on different social media platforms. In these communities, people share their experiences and solicit information by asking questions to learn about opioid use and recovery. However, these communities do not always contain clinically verified information. In this paper, we study natural language questions asked in the context of OUD-related discourse on Reddit. We adopt transformer-based question detection along with hierarchical clustering across 19 subreddits to identify six coarse-grained categories and 69 fine-grained categories of OUD-related questions. Our analysis uncovers ten areas of information seeking from Reddit users in the context of OUD: drug sales, specific drug-related questions, OUD treatment, drug uses, side effects, withdrawal, lifestyle, drug testing, pain management and others, during the study period of 2018-2021. Our work provides a major step in improving the understanding of OUD-related questions people ask unobtrusively on Reddit. We finally discuss technological interventions and public health harm reduction techniques based on the topics of these questions."
2504.08152,"How communities respond to diverse societal challenges, from economic crises to political upheavals, is shaped by their collective minds - shared representations of ongoing events and current topics. In turn, collective minds are shaped by a continuous stream of influences, amplified by the rapid rise of online platforms. Online communities must understand these influences to maintain healthy discourse and avoid being manipulated, but understanding is hindered by limited observations and the inability to conduct counterfactual experiments. Here, we show how collective minds in online news communities can be influenced by different editorial agenda-setting practices and aspects of community dynamics, and how these influences can be reversed. We develop a computational model of collective minds, calibrated and validated with data from 400 million comments across five U.S. online news platforms and a large-scale survey. The model enables us to describe and experiment with a variety of influences and derive quantitative insights into their magnitude and persistence in different communities. We find that some editorial influences can be reversed relatively rapidly, but others, such as amplification and reframing of certain topics, as well as community influences such as trolling and counterspeech, tend to persist and durably change the collective mind. These findings illuminate ways collective minds can be manipulated and pathways for communities to maintain healthy and authentic collective discourse amid ongoing societal challenges."
2504.08413,"To obtain a foundational understanding of timeline algorithms and viral content in shaping public opinions, computer scientists started to study augmented versions of opinion formation models from sociology. In this paper, we generalize the popular Friedkin--Johnsen model to include the effects of external media sources on opinion formation. Our goal is to mathematically analyze the influence of biased media, arising from factors such as manipulated news reporting or the phenomenon of false balance. Within our framework, we examine the scenario of two opposing media sources, which do not adapt their opinions like ordinary nodes, and analyze the conditions and the number of periods required for radicalizing the opinions in the network. When both media sources possess equal influence, we theoretically characterize the final opinion configuration. In the special case where there is only a single media source present, we prove that media sources which do not adapt their opinions are significantly more powerful than those which do. Lastly, we conduct the experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets, showing that our theoretical guarantees closely align with experimental simulations."
2504.0896,"Incivility refers to behaviors that violate collective norms and disrupt cooperation within the political process. Although large-scale online data and automated techniques have enabled the quantitative analysis of uncivil discourse, prior research has predominantly focused on impoliteness or toxicity, often overlooking other behaviors that undermine democratic values. To address this gap, we propose a multidimensional conceptual framework encompassing Impoliteness, Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric, Hate Speech and Stereotyping, and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values. Using this framework, we measure the spread of online political incivility in Brazil using approximately 5 million tweets posted by 2,307 political influencers during the 2022 Brazilian general election. Through statistical modeling and network analysis, we examine the dynamics of uncivil posts at different election stages, identify key disseminators and audiences, and explore the mechanisms driving the spread of uncivil information online. Our findings indicate that impoliteness is more likely to surge during election campaigns. In contrast, the other dimensions of incivility are often triggered by specific violent events. Moreover, we find that left-aligned individual influencers are the primary disseminators of online incivility in the Brazilian Twitter/X sphere and that they disseminate not only direct incivility but also indirect incivility when discussing or opposing incivility expressed by others. They relay those content from politicians, media agents, and individuals to reach broader audiences, revealing a diffusion pattern mixing the direct and two-step flows of communication theory. This study offers new insights into the multidimensional nature of incivility in Brazilian politics and provides a conceptual framework that can be extended to other political contexts."
2504.09376,"Many social media studies argue that social media creates echo chambers where some users only interact with peers of the same political orientation. However, recent studies suggest that a substantial amount of Cross-Partisan Interactions (CPIs) do exist - even within echo chambers, but they may be toxic. There is no consensus about how such interactions occur and when they lead to healthy or toxic dialogue. In this paper, we study a comprehensive Twitter dataset that consists of 3 million tweets from 2020 related to the U.S. context to understand the dynamics behind CPIs. We investigate factors that are more associated with such interactions, including how users engage in CPIs, which topics are more contentious, and what are the stances associated with healthy interactions. We find that CPIs are significantly influenced by the nature of the topics being discussed, with politically charged events acting as strong catalysts. The political discourse and pre-established political views sway how users participate in CPIs, but the direction in which users go is nuanced. While Democrats engage in cross-partisan interactions slightly more frequently, these interactions often involve more negative and nonconstructive stances compared to their intra-party interactions. In contrast, Republicans tend to maintain a more consistent tone across interactions. Although users are more likely to engage in CPIs with popular accounts in general, this is less common among Republicans who often engage in CPIs with accounts with a low number of followers for personal matters. Our study has implications beyond Twitter as identifying topics with low toxicity and high CPI can help highlight potential opportunities for reducing polarization while topics with high toxicity and low CPI may action targeted interventions when moderating harm."
2504.09428,"Due to the convenience of mobile devices, the online games have become an important part for user entertainments in reality, creating a demand for friend recommendation in online games. However, none of existing approaches can effectively incorporate the multi-modal user features (e.g., images and texts) with the structural information in the friendship graph, due to the following limitations: (1) some of them ignore the high-order structural proximity between users, (2) some fail to learn the pairwise relevance between users at modality-specific level, and (3) some cannot capture both the local and global user preferences on different modalities. By addressing these issues, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end model FROG that better models the user preferences on potential friends. Comprehensive experiments on both offline evaluation and online deployment at Tencent have demonstrated the superiority of FROG over existing approaches."
2504.09769,"In numerous networks, it is vital to identify communities consisting of closely joined groups of individuals. Such communities often reveal the role of the networks or primary properties of the individuals. In this perspective, Newman and Girvan proposed a modularity score (Q) for quantifying the power of community structure and measuring the appropriateness of a division. The Q function has newly become a significant standard. In this paper, the strengths of the Q score and another technique known as the divisive algorithm are combined to enhance the efficiently of the identification of communities from a network. To achieve that goal, we have developed a new algorithm. The simulation results indicated that our algorithm achieved a division with a slightly higher Q score against some conventional methods."
2504.09978,"In this article we have shown that the distributions of ksi satisfy an exponential law for real networks while the distributions of ksi for random networks are bell-shaped and closer to the normal distribution. The ksi distributions for Barabasi-Albert and Watts-Strogatz networks are similar to the ksi distributions for random networks (bell-shaped) for most parameters, but when these parameters become small enough, the Barabasi-Albert and Watts-Strogatz networks become more realistic with respect to the ksi distributions."
2504.10058,"Data cooperatives offer a new model for fair data governance, enabling individuals to collectively control, manage, and benefit from their information while adhering to cooperative principles such as democratic member control, economic participation, and community concern. This paper reviews data cooperatives, distinguishing them from models like data trusts, data commons, and data unions, and defines them based on member ownership, democratic governance, and data sovereignty. It explores applications in sectors like healthcare, agriculture, and construction. Despite their potential, data cooperatives face challenges in coordination, scalability, and member engagement, requiring innovative governance strategies, robust technical systems, and mechanisms to align member interests with cooperative goals. The paper concludes by advocating for data cooperatives as a sustainable, democratic, and ethical model for the future data economy."
2504.10286,"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to simulate human decision-making processes, enabling their use as agents in modeling sophisticated social networks, both offline and online. Recent research has explored collective behavioral patterns and structural characteristics of LLM agents within simulated networks. However, empirical comparisons between LLM-driven and human-driven online social networks remain scarce, limiting our understanding of how LLM agents differ from human users. This paper presents a large-scale analysis ofthis http URL, an X/Twitter-like social network entirely populated by LLM agents, comprising over 65,000 agents and 7.7 million AI-generated posts. For comparison, we collect a parallel dataset from Mastodon, a human-driven decentralized social network, with over 117,000 users and 16 million posts. We examine key differences between LLM agents and humans in posting behaviors, abusive content, and social network structures. Our findings provide critical insights into the evolving landscape of online social network analysis in the AI era, offering a comprehensive profile of LLM agents in social simulations."
2504.10456,"Social interactions among classroom peers, represented as social learning networks (SLNs), play a crucial role in enhancing learning outcomes. While SLN analysis has recently garnered attention, most existing approaches rely on centralized training, where data is aggregated and processed on a local/cloud server with direct access to raw data. However, in real-world educational settings, such direct access across multiple classrooms is often restricted due to privacy concerns. Furthermore, training models on isolated classroom data prevents the identification of common interaction patterns that exist across multiple classrooms, thereby limiting model performance. To address these challenges, we propose one of the first frameworks that integrates Federated Learning (FL), a distributed and collaborative machine learning (ML) paradigm, with SLNs derived from students' interactions in multiple classrooms' online forums to predict future link formations (i.e., interactions) among students. By leveraging FL, our approach enables collaborative model training across multiple classrooms while preserving data privacy, as it eliminates the need for raw data centralization. Recognizing that each classroom may exhibit unique student interaction dynamics, we further employ model personalization techniques to adapt the FL model to individual classroom characteristics. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing both shared and classroom-specific representations of student interactions in SLNs. Additionally, we utilize explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret model predictions, identifying key factors that influence link formation across different classrooms. These insights unveil the drivers of social learning interactions within a privacy-preserving, collaborative, and distributed ML framework -- an aspect that has not been explored before."
2504.10501,"Widespread stigma, both in the offline and online spaces, acts as a barrier to harm reduction efforts in the context of opioid use disorder (OUD). This stigma is prominently directed towards clinically approved medications for addiction treatment (MAT), people with the condition, and the condition itself. Given the potential of artificial intelligence based technologies in promoting health equity, and facilitating empathic conversations, this work examines whether large language models (LLMs) can help abate OUD-related stigma in online communities. To answer this, we conducted a series of pre-registered randomized controlled experiments, where participants read LLM-generated, human-written, or no responses to help seeking OUD-related content in online communities. The experiment was conducted under two setups, i.e., participants read the responses either once (N = 2,141), or repeatedly for 14 days (N = 107). We found that participants reported the least stigmatized attitudes toward MAT after consuming LLM-generated responses under both the setups. This study offers insights into strategies that can foster inclusive online discourse on OUD, e.g., based on our findings LLMs can be used as an education-based intervention to promote positive attitudes and increase people's propensity toward MAT."
2504.10506,"High-quality human mobility data is crucial for applications such as urban planning, transportation management, and public health, yet its collection is often hindered by privacy concerns and data scarcity-particularly in less-developed regions. To address this challenge, we introduce WorldMove, a large-scale synthetic mobility dataset covering over 1,600 cities across 179 countries and 6 continents. Our method leverages publicly available multi-source data, including gridded population distribution, point-of-interest (POI) maps, and commuting origin-destination (OD) flows-to generate realistic city-scale mobility trajectories using a diffusion-based generative model. The generation process involves defining city boundaries, collecting multi-source input features, and simulating individual-level movements that reflect plausible daily mobility behavior. Comprehensive validation demonstrates that the generated data closely aligns with real-world observations, both in terms of fine-grained individual mobility behavior and city-scale population flows. Alongside the pre-generated datasets, we release the trained model and a complete open-source pipeline, enabling researchers and practitioners to generate custom synthetic mobility data for any city worldwide. This work not only fills critical data gaps, but also lays a global foundation for scalable, privacy-preserving, and inclusive mobility research-empowering data-scarce regions and enabling universal access to human mobility insights."
2504.10511,"Factual claims and misinformation circulate widely on social media and affect how people form opinions and make decisions. This paper presents a truthfulness stance map (TrustMap), an application that identifies and maps public stances toward factual claims across U.S. regions. Each social media post is classified as positive, negative, or neutral/no stance, based on whether it believes a factual claim is true or false, expresses uncertainty about the truthfulness, or does not explicitly take a position on the claim's truthfulness. The tool uses a retrieval-augmented model with fine-tuned language models for automatic stance classification. The stance classification results and social media posts are grouped by location to show how stance patterns vary geographically. TrustMap allows users to explore these patterns by claim and region and connects stance detection with geographical analysis to better understand public engagement with factual claims."
2504.10521,"As the popularity and reach of social networks continue to surge, a vast reservoir of opinions and sentiments across various subjects inundates these platforms. Among these, X social network (formerly Twitter) stands as a juggernaut, boasting approximately 420 million active users. Extracting users' emotional and mental states from their expressed opinions on social media has become a common pursuit. While past methodologies predominantly focused on the textual content of messages to analyze user sentiment, the interactive nature of these platforms suggests a deeper complexity. This study employs hybrid methodologies, integrating textual analysis, profile examination, follower analysis, and emotion dissemination patterns. Initially, user interactions are leveraged to refine emotion classification within messages, encompassing exchanges where users respond to each other. Introducing the concept of a communication tree, a model is extracted to map these interactions. Subsequently, users' bios and interests from this tree are juxtaposed with message text to enrich analysis. Finally, influential figures are identified among users' followers in the communication tree, categorized into different topics to gauge interests. The study highlights that traditional sentiment analysis methodologies, focusing solely on textual content, are inadequate in discerning sentiment towards significant events, notably the presidential election. Comparative analysis with conventional methods reveals a substantial improvement in accuracy with the incorporation of emotion distribution patterns and user profiles. The proposed approach yields a 12% increase in accuracy with emotion distribution patterns and a 15% increase when considering user profiles, underscoring its efficacy in capturing nuanced sentiment dynamics."
2504.11059,"Understanding community structures is crucial for analyzing networks, as nodes join communities that collectively shape large-scale networks. In real-world settings, the formation of communities is often impacted by several social factors, such as ethnicity, gender, wealth, or other attributes. These factors may introduce structural inequalities; for instance, real-world networks can have a few majority groups and many minority groups. Community detection algorithms, which identify communities based on network topology, may generate unfair outcomes if they fail to account for existing structural inequalities, particularly affecting underrepresented groups. In this work, we propose a set of novel group fairness metrics to assess the fairness of community detection methods. Additionally, we conduct a comparative evaluation of the most common community detection methods, analyzing the trade-off between performance and fairness. Experiments are performed on synthetic networks generated using LFR, ABCD, and HICH-BA benchmark models, as well as on real-world networks. Our results demonstrate that the fairness-performance trade-off varies widely across methods, with no single class of approaches consistently excelling in both aspects. We observe that Infomap and Significance methods are high-performing and fair with respect to different types of communities across most networks. The proposed metrics and findings provide valuable insights for designing fair and effective community detection algorithms."
2504.1109,"With a folk understanding that political polarization refers to socio-political divisions within a society, many have proclaimed that we are more divided than ever. In this account, polarization has been blamed for populism, the erosion of social cohesion, the loss of trust in the institutions of democracy, legislative dysfunction, and the collective failure to address existential risks such as Covid-19 or climate change. However, at a global scale there is surprisingly little academic literature which conclusively supports these claims, with half of all studies being U.S.-focused. Here, we provide an overview of the global state of research on polarization, highlighting insights that are robust across countries, those unique to specific contexts, and key gaps in the literature. We argue that addressing these gaps is urgent, but has been hindered thus far by systemic and cultural barriers, such as regionally stratified restrictions on data access and misaligned research incentives. If continued cross-disciplinary inertia means that these disparities are left unaddressed, we see a substantial risk that countries will adopt policies to tackle polarization based on inappropriate evidence, risking flawed decision-making and the weakening of democratic institutions."
2504.11245,"Influence Maximization (IM) in temporal graphs focuses on identifying influential ""seeds"" that are pivotal for maximizing network expansion. We advocate defining these seeds through Influence Propagation Paths (IPPs), which is essential for scaling up the network. Our focus lies in efficiently labeling IPPs and accurately predicting these seeds, while addressing the often-overlooked cold-start issue prevalent in temporal networks. Our strategy introduces a motif-based labeling method and a tensorized Temporal Graph Network (TGN) tailored for multi-relational temporal graphs, bolstering prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, we augment cold-start nodes with new neighbors from historical data sharing similar IPPs. The recommendation system within an online team-based gaming environment presents subtle impact on the social network, forming multi-relational (i.e., weak and strong) temporal graphs for our empirical IM study. We conduct offline experiments to assess prediction accuracy and model training efficiency, complemented by online A/B testing to validate practical network growth and the effectiveness in addressing the cold-start issue."
2504.11621,"Community detection, the unsupervised task of clustering nodes of a graph, finds applications across various fields. The common approaches for community detection involve optimizing an objective function to partition the nodes into communities at a single scale of granularity. However, the single-scale approaches often fall short of producing partitions that are robust and at a suitable scale. The existing algorithm, PyGenStability, returns multiple robust partitions for a network by optimizing the multi-scale Markov stability function. However, in cases where the suitable scale is not known or assumed by the user, there is no principled method to select a single robust partition at a suitable scale from the multiple partitions that PyGenStability produces. Our proposed method combines the Markov stability framework with a pre-trained machine learning model for scale selection to obtain one robust partition at a scale that is learned based on the graph structure. This automatic scale selection involves using a gradient boosting model pre-trained on hand-crafted and embedding-based network features from a labeled dataset of 10k benchmark networks. This model was trained to predicts the scale value that maximizes the similarity of the output partition to the planted partition of the benchmark network. Combining our scale selection algorithm with the PyGenStability algorithm results in PyGenStabilityOne (PO): a hyperparameter-free multi-scale community detection algorithm that returns one robust partition at a suitable scale without the need for any assumptions, input, or tweaking from the user. We compare the performance of PO against 29 algorithms and show that it outperforms 25 other algorithms by statistically meaningful margins. Our results facilitate choosing between community detection algorithms, among which PO stands out as the accurate, robust, and hyperparameter-free method."
2504.11932,"As international competition intensifies in technologies, nations need to identify key technologies to foster innovation. However, the identification is challenging due to the independent and inherently complex nature of technologies. Traditionally, regional analyses of technological portfolios have been limited to binary evaluations, indicating merely whether a region specializes in a technology, or relying on the average Technological Complexity Index (TCI) of the specialized technologies. This study proposes that evaluating TCI at the corporate level could provide finer granularity and more detailed insights. To address the underutilization of corporate-level TCI assessments in Japan, this study applies the Technological Complexity Index using carefully processed patent data spanning fiscal years 1981 to 2010. Specifically, we analyze a bipartite network composed of 1,938 corporations connected to technological fields categorized into either 35 or 124 classifications. Our findings quantitatively characterize the ubiquity and sophistication of each technological field, reveal detailed technological trends reflecting broader societal contexts, and demonstrate methodological stability even when employing finer technological classifications. Additionally, our corporate-level approach allows consistent comparisons across different regions and technological fields, clarifying regional advantages in specific technologies. This refined analytical framework offers policymakers and researchers robust, targeted insights, thereby significantly contributing to innovation strategy formulation in Japan."
2504.12902,"This study investigates the rapid growth and evolving network structure of Bluesky from August 2023 to February 2025. Through multiple waves of user migrations, the platform has reached a stable, persistently active user base. The growth process has given rise to a dense follower network with clustering and hub features that favor viral information diffusion. These developments highlight engagement and structural similarities between Bluesky and established platforms."
2504.13279,"TikTok is now a massive platform, and has a deep impact on global events. Despite preliminary studies, issues remain in determining fundamental characteristics of the platform. We develop a method to extract a representative sample of >99% of posts from a given time range on TikTok, and use it to collect all posts from a full hour on the platform, alongside all posts from a single minute from each hour of a day. Through this, we obtain post metadata, video media, and comments from a close-to-complete slice of TikTok, and report the critical statistics of the platform. Notably, we estimate a total of 269 million posts produced on the day we looked at, that 18% of videos on the platform feature children, and that at least 0.5% of posts contain artificial intelligence-generated content."
2504.13538,"Community detection plays a crucial role in understanding the structural organization of complex networks. Previous methods, particularly those from statistical physics, primarily focus on the analysis of mesoscopic network structures and often struggle to integrate fine-grained node similarities. To address this limitation, we propose a low-complexity framework that integrates machine learning to embed micro-level node-pair similarities into mesoscopic community structures. By leveraging ensemble learning models, our approach enhances both structural coherence and detection accuracy. Experimental evaluations on artificial and real-world networks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms conventional methods, achieving higher modularity and improved accuracy in NMI and ARI. Notably, when ground-truth labels are available, our approach yields the most accurate detection results, effectively recovering real-world community structures while minimizing misclassifications. To further explain our framework's performance, we analyze the correlation between node-pair similarity and evaluation metrics. The results reveal a strong and statistically significant correlation, underscoring the critical role of node-pair similarity in enhancing detection accuracy. Overall, our findings highlight the synergy between machine learning and statistical physics, demonstrating how machine learning techniques can enhance network analysis and uncover complex structural patterns."
2504.13632,"Session-based Recommendation (SR) systems have recently achieved considerable success, yet their complex, ""black box"" nature often obscures why certain recommendations are made. Existing explanation methods struggle to pinpoint truly influential factors, as they frequently depend on static user profiles or fail to grasp the intricate dynamics within user sessions. In response, we introduce FCESR (Factual and Counterfactual Explanations for Session-based Recommendation), a novel framework designed to illuminate SR model predictions by emphasizing both the sufficiency (factual) and necessity (counterfactual) of recommended items. By recasting explanation generation as a combinatorial optimization challenge and leveraging reinforcement learning, our method uncovers the minimal yet critical sequence of items influencing recommendations. Moreover, recognizing the intrinsic value of robust explanations, we innovatively utilize these factual and counterfactual insights within a contrastive learning paradigm, employing them as high-quality positive and negative samples to fine-tune and significantly enhance SR accuracy. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations across diverse datasets and multiple SR architectures confirm that our framework not only boosts recommendation accuracy but also markedly elevates the quality and interpretability of explanations, thereby paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy recommendation systems."
2504.13641,"This paper proposes a voting process in which voters allocate fractional votes to their expected utility in different domains: over proposals, other participants, and sets containing proposals and participants. This approach allows for a more nuanced expression of preferences by calculating the result and relevance within each node. We modeled this by creating a voting matrix that reflects their preference. We use absorbing Markov chains to gain the consensus, and also calculate the influence within the participating nodes. We illustrate this method in action through an experiment with 69 students using a budget allocation topic."
2504.13674,"Minority college students face unique challenges shaped by their identities based on their gender/sexual orientation, race, religion, and academic institutions, which influence their academic and social experiences. Although research has highlighted the challenges faced by individual minority groups, the stigma process-labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and discrimination-that underpin these experiences remains underexamined, particularly in the online spaces where college students are highly active. We address these gaps by examining posts on subreddit, r/college, as indicators for stigma processes, our approach applies a Stereotype-BERT model, including stance toward each stereotype. We extend the stereotype model to encompass status loss and discrimination by using semantic distance with their reference sentences. Our analyses show that professional indicated posts are primarily labeled under the stereotyping stage, whereas posts indicating racial are highly represented in status loss and discrimination. Intersectional identified posts are more frequently associated with status loss and discrimination. The findings of this study highlight the need for multifaceted intersectional approaches to identifying stigma, which subsequently serve as indicators to promote equity for minority groups, especially racial minorities and those experiencing compounded vulnerabilities due to intersecting identities."
2504.13931,"In French, the phrase ""Un ange passe"" (""An angel passes"") refers to the sudden silence that falls over a co-present group -- that is, a group of people sharing the same physical space. As evidenced by the presence of similar expressions across languages and cultures, this phenomenon represents a universal feature of human conversation. At the same time, the meaning attributed to silence can differ greatly across national, cultural, and interpersonal contexts. Consequently, a wide range of studies have focused on the impact of silence on organizational productivity, its relationship to ideas and creativity, and its potential effectiveness in medical settings. Despite the important role that silence plays, very few studies have attempted to characterize its features using mathematical modeling. In this study, we propose a Markov chain model to describe the dynamics of silence in a co-present group and attempt to analyze its behavior. Our results reveal a phase-transition-like phenomenon, where the probability of silence abruptly drops to zero once individuals' awareness of the surrounding conversation falls below a critical threshold. In other words, such silence can emerge only when individuals retain a minimal degree of mutual awareness of those around them. The model proposed in this study not only offers a deeper understanding of conversational dynamics, but also holds potential for contributing to intercultural communication, organizational productivity, and medical practice."
2504.14093,"The recognition of individual contributions is central to the scientific reward system, yet coauthored papers often obscure who did what. Traditional proxies like author order assume a simplistic decline in contribution, while emerging practices such as self-reported roles are biased and limited in scope. We introduce a large-scale, behavior-based approach to identifying individual contributions in scientific papers. Using author-specific LaTeX macros as writing signatures, we analyze over 730,000 arXiv papers (1991-2023), covering over half a million scientists. Validated against self-reports, author order, disciplinary norms, and Overleaf records, our method reliably infers author-level writing activity. Section-level traces reveal a hidden division of labor: first authors focus on technical sections (e.g., Methods, Results), while last authors primarily contribute to conceptual sections (e.g., Introduction, Discussion). Our findings offer empirical evidence of labor specialization at scale and new tools to improve credit allocation in collaborative research."
2504.14172,"Nowadays, social media is the main tool in our new lives. The outbreak news and all related obtained from social media, and mob events affect the of spread these news fast. Recently, epidemiological models to study disease spread and analyze the behavior of mob groups by dealing with ""contagions"" that propagate through user networks. In this research, we introduced a mathematical model to analyze social behavior related to COVID-19 spread by examining Twitter activity from April 2020 to June 2020. The main feature of this model is the integration of mobility dynamics that be derived from the above real data, to adjust the rate of outbreak based on the response of social interactions. Consider mobility as a parameter of time-varying, and fluctuations in the rate of contact that is driven by factors like personal behavior or external affecting such as ""lockdown"" and ""quarantine"" etc., to track public sentiment and engagement trends during the pandemic. The threshold number is derived, and the existence of bifurcation and the stability of the steady states are established. Numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis of relevant parameters are also carried out."
2504.14438,"This paper models information diffusion in a network of Large Language Models (LLMs) that is designed to answer queries from distributed datasets, where the LLMs can hallucinate the answer. We introduce a two-time-scale dynamical model for the centrally administered network, where opinions evolve faster while the network's degree distribution changes more slowly. Using a mean-field approximation, we establish conditions for a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium where all LLMs remain truthful. We provide approximation guarantees for the mean-field approximation and a singularly perturbed approximation of the two-time-scale system. To mitigate hallucination and improve the influence of truthful nodes, we propose a reputation-based preferential attachment mechanism that reconfigures the network based on LLMs' evaluations of their neighbors. Numerical experiments on an open-source LLM (LLaMA-3.1-8B) validate the efficacy of our preferential attachment mechanism and demonstrate the optimization of a cost function for the two-time-scale system."
2504.14501,"Community detection is a key tool for analyzing the structure of large networks. Standard methods, such as modularity optimization, focus on identifying densely connected groups but often overlook natural local separations in the graph. In this paper, we investigate local separator methods, which decompose networks based on structural bottlenecks rather than global connectivity. We systematically compare them with well-established community detection algorithms on large real-world networks. Our results show that local 1-separators consistently identify the densest communities, outperforming modularity-based methods in this regard, while local 2-separators reveal hierarchical structures but may over-fragment small clusters. These findings are particularly strong for road networks, suggesting practical applications in transportation and infrastructure analysis. Our study highlights local separators as a scalable and interpretable alternative for network decomposition."
2504.14904,"Exponentially growing short video platforms (SVPs) face significant challenges in moderating content detrimental to users' mental health, particularly for minors. The dissemination of such content on SVPs can lead to catastrophic societal consequences. Although substantial efforts have been dedicated to moderating such content, existing methods suffer from critical limitations: (1) Manual review is prone to human bias and incurs high operational costs. (2) Automated methods, though efficient, lack nuanced content understanding, resulting in lower accuracy. (3) Industrial moderation regulations struggle to adapt to rapidly evolving trends due to long update cycles. In this paper, we annotate the first SVP content moderation benchmark with authentic user/reviewer feedback to fill the absence of benchmark in this field. Then we evaluate various methods on the benchmark to verify the existence of the aforementioned limitations. We further propose our common-law content moderation framework named KuaiMod to address these challenges. KuaiMod consists of three components: training data construction, offline adaptation, and online deployment & refinement. Leveraging large vision language model (VLM) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, KuaiMod adequately models video toxicity based on sparse user feedback and fosters dynamic moderation policy with rapid update speed and high accuracy. Offline experiments and large-scale online A/B test demonstrates the superiority of KuaiMod: KuaiMod achieves the best moderation performance on our benchmark. The deployment of KuaiMod reduces the user reporting rate by 20% and its application in video recommendation increases both Daily Active User (DAU) and APP Usage Time (AUT) on several Kuaishou scenarios. We have open-sourced our benchmark atthis https URL."
2504.15072,"The rapid development of social media has significantly reshaped the dynamics of public opinion, resulting in complex interactions that traditional models fail to effectively capture. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative approach that integrates multi-dimensional Hawkes processes with Graph Neural Network, modeling opinion propagation dynamics among nodes in a social network while considering the intricate hierarchical relationships between comments. The extended multi-dimensional Hawkes process captures the hierarchical structure, multi-dimensional interactions, and mutual influences across different topics, forming a complex propagation network. Moreover, recognizing the lack of high-quality datasets capable of comprehensively capturing the evolution of public opinion dynamics, we introduce a new dataset, VISTA. It includes 159 trending topics, corresponding to 47,207 posts, 327,015 second-level comments, and 29,578 third-level comments, covering diverse domains such as politics, entertainment, sports, health, and medicine. The dataset is annotated with detailed sentiment labels across 11 categories and clearly defined hierarchical relationships. When combined with our method, it offers strong interpretability by linking sentiment propagation to the comment hierarchy and temporal evolution. Our approach provides a robust baseline for future research."
2504.15131,"The Competitive Influence Maximization (CIM) problem involves multiple entities competing for influence in online social networks (OSNs). While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise, existing methods often assume users' opinions are binary and ignore their behavior and prior knowledge. We propose DRIM, a multi-dimensional uncertainty-aware DRL-based CIM framework that leverages Subjective Logic (SL) to model uncertainty in user opinions, preferences, and DRL decision-making. DRIM introduces an Uncertainty-based Opinion Model (UOM) for a more realistic representation of user uncertainty and optimizes seed selection for propagating true information while countering false information. In addition, it quantifies uncertainty in balancing exploration and exploitation. Results show that UOM significantly enhances true information spread and maintains influence against advanced false information strategies. DRIM-based CIM schemes outperform state-of-the-art methods by up to 57% and 88% in influence while being up to 48% and 77% faster. Sensitivity analysis indicates that higher network observability and greater information propagation boost performance, while high network activity mitigates the effect of users' initial biases."
2504.15215,"Increasingly, people use social media for their day-to-day interactions and as a source of information, even though much of this information is practically anonymous. This raises the question: does anonymous information influence its recipients? We conducted an online, two-phase, preregistered experiment using a nationally representative sample of participants from the U.S. to find the answer. To avoid biases of opinions among participants, in the first phase, each participant examines ten Rorschach inkblots and chooses one of four opinions assigned to each inkblot. In the second phase, the participants are randomly assigned to one of four distinct information conditions and are asked to revisit their opinions for the same ten inkblots. Conditions ranged from repeating phase one to receiving anonymous comments about certain opinions. Results were consistent with the preregistration. Importantly, anonymous comments shown in phase two influence up to half of the participants' opinion selections. To better understand the role of anonymous comments in influencing the selections of opinions, we implemented agent-based modeling (ABM). ABM results suggest that a straightforward mechanism can explain the impact of such information. Overall, our results indicate that even anonymous information can have a significant impact on its recipients, potentially altering their popularity rankings. However, the strength of such influence weakens when recipients' confidence in their selections increases. Additionally, we found that participants' confidence in the first phase is inversely related to the number of change opinions."
2504.15927,"Semi-supervised community detection methods are widely used for identifying specific communities due to the label scarcity. Existing semi-supervised community detection methods typically involve two learning stages learning in both initial identification and subsequent adjustment, which often starts from an unreasonable community core candidate. Moreover, these methods encounter scalability issues because they depend on reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks, leading to higher computational costs and restricting the selection of candidates. To address these limitations, we draw a parallel between crystallization kinetics and community detection to integrate the spontaneity of the annealing process into community detection. Specifically, we liken community detection to identifying a crystal subgrain (core) that expands into a complete grain (community) through a process similar to annealing. Based on this finding, we propose CLique ANNealing (CLANN), which applies kinetics concepts to community detection by integrating these principles into the optimization process to strengthen the consistency of the community core. Subsequently, a learning-free Transitive Annealer was employed to refine the first-stage candidates by merging neighboring cliques and repositioning the community core, enabling a spontaneous growth process that enhances scalability. Extensive experiments on \textbf{43} different network settings demonstrate that CLANN outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple real-world datasets, showcasing its exceptional efficacy and efficiency in community detection."
2504.16307,"Schelling segregation is a well-established model used to investigate the dynamics of segregation in agent-based models. Since we consider segregation to be key for the development of political polarisation, we are interested in what insights it could give for this problem. We tested basic questions of segregation on an agent-based social network model where agents' connections were not restricted by their spatial position, and made the network graph much denser than previous tests of Schelling segregation in social networks.We found that a dense social network does not become as strongly segregated as a sparse network, and that agents' numbers of same-group neighbours do not greatly exceed their desired numbers (i.e. they do not end up more segregated than they desire to be). Furthermore, we found that the network was very difficult to polarise when one group was somewhat smaller than the other, and that the network became unstable when one group was extremely small; both phenomena may help explain the complexity of real-world polarisation dynamics, such as unique risks faced by very small group sin a society. Finally we tested Fossett's (2006) ""paradox of weak minority preferences"", a well-established result in grid- and map-based models which shows that an increase in the minority group's desire for same-group neighbours can create more segregation than a similar increase for the majority group. In a densely connected social network, we find that the evidence for this effect is mixed."
2504.16366,"Many barriers exist when new members join a research community, including impostor syndrome. These barriers can be especially challenging for undergraduate students who are new to research. In our work, we explore how the use of social computing tools in the form of spontaneous online social networks (SOSNs) can be used in small research communities to improve sense of belonging, peripheral awareness, and feelings of togetherness within an existing CS research community. Inspired by SOSNs such as BeReal, we integrated a Wizard-of-Oz photo sharing bot into a computing research lab to foster community building among members. Through a small sample of lab members (N = 17) over the course of 2 weeks, we observed an increase in participants' sense of togetherness based on pre- and post-study surveys. Our surveys and semi-structured interviews revealed that this approach has the potential to increase awareness of peers' personal lives, increase feelings of community, and reduce feelings of disconnectedness."
2504.16942,"Scalable general-purpose representations of the built environment are crucial for geospatial artificial intelligence applications. This paper introduces S2Vec, a novel self-supervised framework for learning such geospatial embeddings. S2Vec uses the S2 Geometry library to partition large areas into discrete S2 cells, rasterizes built environment feature vectors within cells as images, and applies masked autoencoding on these rasterized images to encode the feature vectors. This approach yields task-agnostic embeddings that capture local feature characteristics and broader spatial relationships. We evaluate S2Vec on three large-scale socioeconomic prediction tasks, showing its competitive performance against state-of-the-art image-based embeddings. We also explore the benefits of combining S2Vec embeddings with image-based embeddings downstream, showing that such multimodal fusion can often improve performance. Our results highlight how S2Vec can learn effective general-purpose geospatial representations and how it can complement other data modalities in geospatial artificial intelligence."
2504.16944,"This work focuses on showing some arguments addressed to dismantle the extended idea about that social networks completely lacks of privacy properties. We consider the so-called active attacks to the privacy of social networks and the counterpart $(k,\ell)$-anonymity measure, which is used to quantify the privacy satisfied by a social network against active attacks. To this end, we make use of the graph theoretical concept of $k$-metric antidimensional graphs for which the case $k=1$ represents those graphs achieving the worst scenario in privacy whilst considering the $(k,\ell)$-anonymity measure.As a product of our investigation, we present a large number of computational results stating that social networks might not be as insecure as one often thinks. In particular, we develop a large number of experiments on random graphs which show that the number of $1$-metric antidimensional graphs is indeed ridiculously small with respect to the total number of graphs that can be considered. Moreover, we search on several real networks in order to check if they are $1$-metric antidimensional, and obtain that none of them are such. Along the way, we show some theoretical studies on the mathematical properties of the $k$-metric antidimensional graphs for any suitable $k\ge 1$. In addition, we also describe some operations on graphs that are $1$-metric antidimensional so that they get embedded into another larger graphs that are not such, in order to obscure their privacy properties against active attacks."
2504.16946,"Generative agents offer promising capabilities for simulating realistic urban behaviors. However, existing methods oversimplify transportation choices, rely heavily on static agent profiles leading to behavioral homogenization, and inherit prohibitive computational costs. To address these limitations, we present MobileCity, a lightweight simulation platform designed to model realistic urban mobility with high computational efficiency. We introduce a comprehensive transportation system with multiple transport modes, and collect questionnaire data from respondents to construct agent profiles. To enable scalable simulation, agents perform action selection within a pre-generated action space and uses local models for efficient agent memory generation. Through extensive micro and macro-level evaluations on 4,000 agents, we demonstrate that MobileCity generates more realistic urban behaviors than baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. We further explore practical applications such as predicting movement patterns and analyzing demographic trends in transportation preferences. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL."
2504.16947,"This paper introduces SCRAG, a prediction framework inspired by social computing, designed to forecast community responses to real or hypothetical social media posts. SCRAG can be used by public relations specialists (e.g., to craft messaging in ways that avoid unintended misinterpretations) or public figures and influencers (e.g., to anticipate social responses), among other applications related to public sentiment prediction, crisis management, and social what-if analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generating coherent and contextually rich text, their reliance on static training data and susceptibility to hallucinations limit their effectiveness at response forecasting in dynamic social media environments. SCRAG overcomes these challenges by integrating LLMs with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique rooted in social computing. Specifically, our framework retrieves (i) historical responses from the target community to capture their ideological, semantic, and emotional makeup, and (ii) external knowledge from sources such as news articles to inject time-sensitive context. This information is then jointly used to forecast the responses of the target community to new posts or narratives. Extensive experiments across six scenarios on the X platform (formerly Twitter), tested with various embedding models and LLMs, demonstrate over 10% improvements on average in key evaluation metrics. A concrete example further shows its effectiveness in capturing diverse ideologies and nuances. Our work provides a social computing tool for applications where accurate and concrete insights into community responses are crucial."
2504.17701,"Network sampling is a crucial technique for analyzing large or partially observable networks. However, the effectiveness of different sampling methods can vary significantly depending on the context. In this study, we empirically compare representative methods from three main categories: node-based, edge-based, and exploration-based sampling. We used two real-world datasets for our analysis: a scientific collaboration network and a temporal message-sending network. Our results indicate that no single sampling method consistently outperforms the others in both datasets. Although advanced methods tend to provide better accuracy on static networks, they often perform poorly on temporal networks, where simpler techniques can be more effective. These findings suggest that the best sampling strategy depends not only on the structural characteristics of the network but also on the specific metrics that need to be preserved or analyzed. Our work offers practical insights for researchers in choosing sampling approaches that are tailored to different types of networks and analytical objectives."
2504.18273,"Learning on large graphs presents significant challenges, with traditional Message Passing Neural Networks suffering from computational and memory costs scaling linearly with the number of edges. We introduce the Intersecting Block Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges, we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion, while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes rather than edges."
2504.18837,"Extreme weather events driven by climate change, such as wildfires, floods, and heatwaves, prompt significant public reactions on social media platforms. Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values. Our goal is to guide researchers and practitioners in effectively understanding sentiment during the climate crisis era."
2504.19328,"Graph mining analyzes real-world graphs to find core substructures (connected subgraphs) in applications modeled as graphs. Substructure discovery is a process that involves identifying meaningful patterns, structures, or components within a large data set. These substructures can be of various types, such as frequent patterns, motifs, or other relevant features within the data.To model complex data sets -- with multiple types of entities and relationships -- multilayer networks (or MLNs) have been shown to be more effective as compared to simple and attributed graphs. Analysis algorithms on MLNs using the decoupling approach have been shown to be both efficient and accurate. Hence, this paper focuses on substructure discovery in homogeneous multilayer networks (one type of MLN) using a novel decoupling-based approach. In this approach, each layer is processed independently, and then the results from two or more layers are composed to identify substructures in the entire MLN. The algorithm is designed and implemented, including the composition part, using one of the distributed processing frameworks (the Map/Reduce paradigm) to provide scalability.After establishing the correctness, we analyze the speedup and response time of the proposed algorithm and approach through extensive experimental analysis on large synthetic and real-world data sets with diverse graph characteristics."
2504.19536,"Telegram is a globally popular instant messaging platform known for its strong emphasis on security, privacy, and unique social networking features. It has recently emerged as the host for various cross-domain analysis and research works, such as social media influence, propaganda studies, and extremism. This paper introduces TeleScope, an extensive dataset suite that, to our knowledge, is the largest of its kind. It comprises metadata for about 500K Telegram channels and downloaded message metadata for about 71K public channels, accounting for around 120M crawled messages. We also release channel connections and user interaction data built using Telegram's message-forwarding feature to study multiple use cases, such as information spread and message forwarding patterns. In addition, we provide data enrichments, such as language detection, active message posting periods for each channel, and Telegram entities extracted from messages, that enable online discourse analysis beyond what is possible with the original data alone. The dataset is designed for diverse applications, independent of specific research objectives, and sufficiently versatile to facilitate the replication of social media studies comparable to those conducted on platforms like X (formerly Twitter)"
2504.19594,"Telegram has become a major space for political discourse and alternative media. However, its lack of moderation allows misinformation, extremism, and toxicity to spread. While prior research focused on these particular phenomena or topics, these have mostly been examined separately, and a broader understanding of the Telegram ecosystem is still missing. In this work, we fill this gap by conducting a large-scale analysis of the Italian Telegram sphere, leveraging a dataset of 186 million messages from 13,151 chats collected in 2023. Using network analysis, Large Language Models, and toxicity detection tools, we examine how different thematic communities form, align ideologically, and engage in harmful discourse within the Italian cultural context. Results show strong thematic and ideological homophily. We also identify mixed ideological communities where far-left and far-right rhetoric coexist on particular geopolitical issues. Beyond political analysis, we find that toxicity, rather than being isolated in a few extreme chats, appears widely normalized within highly toxic communities. Moreover, we find that Italian discourse primarily targets Black people, Jews, and gay individuals independently of the topic. Finally, we uncover common trend of intra-national hostility, where Italians often attack other Italians, reflecting regional and intra-regional cultural conflicts that can be traced back to old historical divisions. This study provides the first large-scale mapping of the Italian Telegram ecosystem, offering insights into ideological interactions, toxicity, and identity-targets of hate and contributing to research on online toxicity across different cultural and linguistic contexts on Telegram."
2504.20492,"Link prediction aims to estimate the likelihood of connections between pairs of nodes in complex networks, which is beneficial to many applications from friend recommendation to metabolic network reconstruction. Traditional heuristic-based methodologies in the field of complex networks typically depend on predefined assumptions about node connectivity, limiting their generalizability across diverse networks. While recent graph neural network (GNN) approaches capture global structural features effectively, they often neglect node attributes and intrinsic structural relationships between node pairs. To address this, we propose TriHetGCN, an extension of traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) that incorporates explicit topological indicators -- triadic closure and degree heterogeneity. TriHetGCN consists of three modules: topology feature construction, graph structural representation, and connection probability prediction. The topology feature module constructs node features using shortest path distances to anchor nodes, enhancing global structure perception. The graph structural module integrates topological indicators into the GCN framework to model triadic closure and heterogeneity. The connection probability module uses deep learning to predict links. Evaluated on nine real-world datasets, from traditional networks without node attributes to large-scale networks with rich features, TriHetGCN achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming mainstream methods. This highlights its strong generalization across diverse network types, offering a promising framework that bridges statistical physics and graph deep learning."
2504.21357,"With the rapid development of information technology and the widespread utilization of recommendation algorithms, users are able to access information more conveniently, while the content they receive tends to be homogeneous. Homogeneous viewpoints and preferences tend to cluster users into sub-networks, leading to group polarization and increasing the likelihood of forming information cocoons. This paper aims to handle information cocoon phenomena in debates on social media. In order to investigate potential user connections, we construct a double-layer network that incorporates two dimensions: relational ties and feature-based similarity between users. Based on the structure of the multi-layer network, we promote two graph auto-encoder (GAE) based community detection algorithms, which can be applied to the partition and determination of information cocoons. This paper tests these two algorithms on Cora, Citeseer, and synthetic datasets, comparing them with existing multi-layer network unsupervised community detection algorithms. Numerical experiments illustrate that the algorithms proposed in this paper significantly improve prediction accuracy indicator NMI (normalized mutual information) and network topology indicator Q. Additionally, an influence-based intervention measure on which algorithms can operate is proposed. Through the Markov states transition model, we simulate the intervention effects, which illustrate that our community detection algorithms play a vital role in partitioning and determining information cocoons. Simultaneously, our intervention strategy alleviates the polarization of viewpoints and the formation of information cocoons with minimal intervention effort."
2504.21609,"Nowadays, social media networks are increasingly significant to our lives, the imperative to study social media networks becomes more and more essential. With billions of users across platforms and constant updates, the complexity of modeling social networks is immense. Agent-based modeling (ABM) is widely employed to study social networks community, allowing us to define individual behaviors and simulate system-level evolution. It can be a powerful tool to test how the algorithms affect users behavior. To fully leverage agent-based models,superior data processing and storage capabilities are essential. High Performance Computing (HPC) presents an optimal solution, adept at managing complex computations and analysis, particularly for voluminous or iteration-intensive tasks. We utilize Machine Learning (ML) methods to analyze social media users due to their ability to efficiently process vast amounts of data and derive insights that aid in understanding user behaviors, preferences, and trends. Therefore, our proposal involves ML to characterize user attributes and to develop a general user model for ABM simulation of in social networks on HPC systems."
2505.00005,"As problems in political polarization and the spread of misinformation become serious, belief propagation on a social network becomes an important question to explore. Previous breakthroughs have been made in algorithmic approaches to understanding how group consensus or polarization can occur in a population. This paper proposed a modified model of the Friedkin-Johnsen model that tries to explain the underlying stubbornness of individual as well as possible back fire effect by treating each individual as a single layer neural network on a set of evidence for a particular statement with input being confidence level on each evidence, and belief of the statement is the output of this neural network.In this papar, we reafirmed the importance of Madison's cure for the mischief of faction, and found that when structure of understanding is polarized, a network with a giant component can decrease the variance in the belief distribution more than a network with two communities, but creates more social pressure by doing so. We also found that when community structure is formed, variance in the belief distribution become less sensitive to confidence level of individuals. The model can have various applications to political and historical problems caused by misinfomation and conflicting economic interest as well as applications to personality theory and behavior psychology."
2505.00242,"Large quantities of social activity data, such as weekly web search volumes and the number of new infections with infectious diseases, reflect peoples' interests and activities. It is important to discover temporal patterns from such data and to forecast future activities accurately. However, modeling and forecasting social activity data streams is difficult because they are high-dimensional and composed of multiple time-varying dynamics such as trends, seasonality, and interest diffusion. In this paper, we propose D-Tracker, a method for continuously capturing time-varying temporal patterns within social activity tensor data streams and forecasting future activities. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Interpretable: it incorporates the partial differential equation into a tensor decomposition framework and captures time-varying temporal patterns such as trends, seasonality, and interest diffusion between locations in an interpretable manner; (b) Automatic: it has no hyperparameters and continuously models tensor data streams fully automatically; (c) Scalable: the computation time of D-Tracker is independent of the time series length. Experiments using web search volume data obtained from GoogleTrends, and COVID-19 infection data obtained from COVID-19 Open Data Repository show that our method can achieve higher forecasting accuracy in less computation time than existing methods while extracting the interest diffusion between locations.

2505.00287,"Online communication via avatars provides a richer online social experience than text communication. This reinforces the importance of online social support. Online social support is effective for people who lack social resources because of the anonymity of online communities. We aimed to understand online social support via avatars and their social relationships to provide better social support to avatar users. Therefore, we administered a questionnaire to three avatar communication service users (Second Life, ZEPETO, and Pigg Party) and three text communication service users (Facebook, X, and Instagram) (N=8,947). There was no duplication of users for each service. By comparing avatar and text communication users, we examined the amount of online social support, stability of online relationships, and the relationships between online social support and offline social resources (e.g., offline social support). We observed that avatar communication service users received more online social support, had more stable relationships, and had fewer offline social resources than text communication service users. However, the positive association between online and offline social support for avatar communication users was more substantial than for text communication users. These findings highlight the significance of realistic online communication experiences through avatars, including nonverbal and real-time interactions with co-presence. The findings also highlighted avatar communication service users' problems in the physical world, such as the lack of offline social resources. This study suggests that enhancing online social support through avatars can address these issues. This could help resolve social resource problems, both online and offline in future metaverse societies."
2505.00293,"Online sexual predators target children by building trust, creating dependency, and arranging meetings for sexual purposes. This poses a significant challenge for online communication platforms that strive to monitor and remove such content and terminate predators' accounts. However, these platforms can only take such actions if sexual predators explicitly violate the terms of service, not during the initial stages of relationship-building. This study designed and evaluated a strategy to prevent sexual predation and victimization by delivering warnings and raising awareness among high-risk individuals based on the routine activity theory in criminal psychology. We identified high-risk users as those with a high probability of committing or being subjected to violations, using a machine learning model that analyzed social networks and monitoring data from the platform. We conducted a randomized controlled trial on a Japanese avatar-based communication application, Pigg Party. High-risk players in the intervention group received warnings and awareness-building messages, while those in the control group did not receive the messages, regardless of their risk level. The trial involved 12,842 high-risk players in the intervention group and 12,844 in the control group for 138 days. The intervention successfully reduced violations and being violated among women for 12 weeks, although the impact on men was limited. These findings contribute to efforts to combat online sexual abuse and advance understanding of criminal psychology."
2505.00889,"Analyzing the Erasmus mobility network, we illustrate typical problems and approaches in analyzing weighted networks. We propose alternative exploratory views on the network ""Erasmus+ learning mobility flows since 2014"". The network has 35 nodes (countries), is very dense, and the range of link weights (number of visits) is huge (from 1 to 217003). An increasing transformation is used to reduce the range. The traditional graph-based visualization is unreadable. To gain insight into the structure of a dense network, it can be reduced to a skeleton by removing less essential links and/or nodes. We have determined the 1-neighbors and 2-neighbors subnetworks. The 1-neighbors skeleton highlights Spain as the main attractor in the network. The 2-neighbors skeleton shows the dominant role of Spain, Germany, France, and Italy. The hubs and authorities, Pathfinder and Ps cores methods confirm these observations.Using the ""right"" order of the nodes in a matrix representation can reveal the network structure as block patterns in the displayed matrix. The clustering of network nodes based on corrected Salton dissimilarity again shows the dominant role of Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, but also two main clusters of the division into developed/less developed countries. The Balassa normalization (log(measured/expected) visits) matrix shows that most visits within the two main clusters are above expected, while most visits between them are below expected; within the clusters of Balkan countries, Baltic countries, {SK, CZ, HU}, {IS, DK, NO} visits are much above expected, etc."

When using a knowledge graph, various networks can be obtained from it, and network analysis procedures can be applied to them. RDF is a formalization of the knowledge graph concept for the Semantic Web, but some of its solutions are also extensible to a format for describing general networks."

2505.00958,"The social contagion literature makes a distinction between simple (independent cascade or bond percolation processes that pass infections through edges) and complex contagions (bootstrap percolation or threshold processes that require local reinforcement to spread). However, distinguishing simple and complex contagions using observational data poses a significant challenge in practice. Estimating population-level activation functions from observed contagion dynamics is hindered by confounding factors that influence adoptions (other than neighborhood interactions), as well as heterogeneity in individual behaviors and modeling variations that make it difficult to design appropriate null models for inferring contagion types. Here, we show that a new tool from topological data analysis (TDA), called extended persistent homology (EPH), when applied to contagion processes over networks, can effectively detect simple and complex contagion processes, as well as predict their parameters. We train classification and regression models using EPH-based topological summaries computed on simulated simple and complex contagion dynamics on three real-world network datasets and obtain high predictive performance over a wide range of contagion parameters and under a variety of informational constraints, including uncertainty in model parameters, noise, and partial observability of contagion dynamics. EPH captures the role of cycles of varying lengths in the observed contagion dynamics and offers a useful metric to classify contagion models and predict their parameters. Analyzing geometrical features of network contagion using TDA tools such as EPH can find applications in other network problems such as seeding, vaccination, and quarantine optimization, as well as network inference and reconstruction problems."
2505.01174,"Moderation and blocking behavior, both closely related to the mitigation of abuse and misinformation on social platforms, are fundamental mechanisms for maintaining healthy online communities. However, while centralized platforms typically employ top-down moderation, decentralized networks rely on users to self-regulate through mechanisms like blocking actions to safeguard their online experience. Given the novelty of the decentralized paradigm, addressing self-moderation is critical for understanding how community safety and user autonomy can be effectively balanced. This study examines user blocking on Bluesky, a decentralized social networking platform, providing a comprehensive analysis of over three months of user activity through the lens of blocking behaviour. We define profiles based on 86 features that describe user activity, content characteristics, and network interactions, addressing two primary questions: (1) Is the likelihood of a user being blocked inferable from their online behavior? and (2) What behavioral features are associated with an increased likelihood of being blocked? Our findings offer valuable insights and contribute with a robust analytical framework to advance research in moderation on decentralized social networks."
2505.01219,"Online communities are an increasingly important stakeholder for firms, and despite the growing body of research on them, much remains to be learned about them and about the factors that determine their attributes and sustainability. Whereas most of the literature focuses on predictors such as community activity, network structure, and platform interface, there is little research about behavioral and psychological aspects of community members and leaders. In the present study we focus on the personality traits of community founders as predictors of community attributes and sustainability. We develop a tool to estimate community members' Big Five personality traits from their social media text and use it to estimate the traits of 35,164 founders in 8,625 Reddit communities. We find support for most of our predictions about the relationships between founder traits and community sustainability and attributes, including the level of engagement within the community, aspects of its social network structure, and whether the founders themselves remain active in it."
2505.01698,"The remarkable advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the content generation process in social media, offering significant convenience in writing tasks. However, existing applications, such as sentence completion and fluency enhancement, do not fully address the complex challenges in real-world social media contexts. A prevalent goal among social media users is to increase the visibility and influence of their posts. This paper, therefore, delves into the compelling question: Can LLMs generate personalized influential content to amplify a user's presence on social media? We begin by examining prevalent techniques in content generation to assess their impact on post influence. Acknowledging the critical impact of underlying network structures in social media, which are instrumental in initiating content cascades and highly related to the influence/popularity of a post, we then inject network information into prompt for content generation to boost the post's influence. We design multiple content-centric and structure-aware prompts. The empirical experiments across LLMs validate their ability in improving the influence and draw insights on which strategies are more effective. Our code is available atthis https URL."
2505.0225,"Eating disorders, which include anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, with increased diagnoses linked to heightened exposure to idealized body images online. TikTok, a platform with over a billion predominantly adolescent users, has become a key space where eating disorder content is shared, raising concerns about its impact on vulnerable populations. In response, we present a curated dataset of 43,040 TikTok videos, collected using keywords and hashtags related to eating disorders. Spanning from January 2019 to June 2024, this dataset, offers a comprehensive view of eating disorder-related content on TikTok. Our dataset has the potential to address significant research gaps, enabling analysis of content spread and moderation, user engagement, and the pandemic's influence on eating disorder trends. This work aims to inform strategies for mitigating risks associated with harmful content, contributing valuable insights to the study of digital health and social media's role in shaping mental health."
2505.02317,"Bluesky is a decentralized, Twitter-like social media platform that has rapidly gained popularity. Following an invite-only phase, it officially opened to the public on February 6th, 2024, leading to a significant expansion of its user base. In this paper, we present a longitudinal analysis of user activity in the two months surrounding its public launch, examining how the platform evolved due to this rapid growth. Our analysis reveals that Bluesky exhibits an activity distribution comparable to more established social platforms, yet it features a higher volume of original content relative to reshared posts and maintains low toxicity levels. We further investigate the political leanings of its user base, misinformation dynamics, and engagement in harmful conversations. Our findings indicate that Bluesky users predominantly lean left politically and tend to share high-credibility sources. After the platform's public launch, an influx of new users, particularly those posting in English and Japanese, contributed to a surge in activity. Among them, several accounts displayed suspicious behaviors, such as mass-following users and sharing content from low-credibility news sources. Some of these accounts have already been flagged as spam or suspended, suggesting that Bluesky's moderation efforts have been effective."
2505.02343,"Corrections given by ordinary social media users, also referred to as Social Correction have emerged as a viable intervention against misinformation as per the recent literature. However, little is known about how often users give disputing or endorsing comments and how reliable those comments are. An online experiment was conducted to investigate how users' credibility evaluations of social media posts and their confidence in those evaluations combined with online reputational concerns affect their commenting behaviour. The study found that participants exhibited a more conservative approach when giving disputing comments compared to endorsing ones. Nevertheless, participants were more discerning in their disputing comments than endorsing ones. These findings contribute to a better understanding of social correction on social media and highlight the factors influencing comment behaviour and reliability."
2505.02741,"This work presents dyGRASS, an efficient dynamic algorithm for spectral sparsification of large undirected graphs that undergo streaming edge insertions and deletions. At its core, dyGRASS employs a random-walk-based method to efficiently estimate node-to-node distances in both the original graph (for decremental update) and its sparsifier (for incremental update). For incremental updates, dyGRASS enables the identification of spectrally critical edges among the updates to capture the latest structural changes. For decremental updates, dyGRASS facilitates the recovery of important edges from the original graph back into the sparsifier. To further enhance computational efficiency, dyGRASS employs a GPU-based non-backtracking random walk scheme that allows multiple walkers to operate simultaneously across various target updates. This parallelization significantly improves both the performance and scalability of the proposed dyGRASS framework. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations reveal that dyGRASS achieves approximately a 10x speedup compared to the state-of-the-art incremental sparsification (inGRASS) algorithm while eliminating the setup overhead and improving solution quality in incremental spectral sparsification tasks. Moreover, dyGRASS delivers high efficiency and superior solution quality for fully dynamic graph sparsification, accommodating both edge insertions and deletions across a diverse range of graph instances originating from integrated circuit simulations, finite element analysis, and social networks."
2505.03573,"Clique partitioning is a fundamental network clustering task, with applications in a wide range of computational sciences. It involves identifying an optimal partition of the nodes for a real-valued weighted graph according to the edge weights. An optimal partition is one that maximizes the sum of within-cluster edge weights over all possible node partitions. This paper introduces a novel approximation algorithm named Troika to solve this NP-hard problem in small to mid-sized networks for instances of theoretical and practical relevance. Troika uses a branch-and-cut scheme for branching on node triples to find a partition that is within a user-specified optimality gap tolerance. Troika offers advantages over alternative methods like integer programming solvers and heuristics for clique partitioning. Unlike existing heuristics, Troika returns solutions within a guaranteed proximity to global optimality. And our results indicate that Troika is faster than using the state-of-the-art integer programming solver Gurobi for most benchmark instances. Besides its advantages for solving the clique partitioning problem, we demonstrate the applications of Troika in community detection and portfolio analysis. Troika returns partitions with higher proximity to optimal compared to eight modularity-based community detection algorithms. When used on networks of correlations among stocks, Troika reveals the dynamic changes in the structure of portfolio networks including downturns from the 2008 financial crisis and the reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our comprehensive results based on benchmarks from the literature and new real and random networks point to Troika as a reliable and accurate method for solving clique partitioning instances with up to 5000 edges on standard hardware."
2505.03746,"Social media platforms enable instant and ubiquitous connectivity and are essential to social interaction and communication in our technological society. Apart from its advantages, these platforms have given rise to negative behaviors in the online community, the so-called cyberbullying. Despite the many works involving generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the literature lately, there remain opportunities to study its performance apart from zero/few-shot learning strategies. Accordingly, we propose an innovative and real-time solution for cyberbullying detection that leverages stream-based Machine Learning (ML) models able to process the incoming samples incrementally and Large Language Models (LLMS) for feature engineering to address the evolving nature of abusive and hate speech online. An explainability dashboard is provided to promote the system's trustworthiness, reliability, and accountability. Results on experimental data report promising performance close to 90 % in all evaluation metrics and surpassing those obtained by competing works in the literature. Ultimately, our proposal contributes to the safety of online communities by timely detecting abusive behavior to prevent long-lasting harassment and reduce the negative consequences in society."
2505.03769,"In today's cross-platform social media landscape, understanding factors that drive engagement for multimodal content, especially text paired with visuals, remains complex. This study investigates how rewriting Reddit post titles adapted from YouTube video titles affects user engagement. First, we build and analyze a large dataset of Reddit posts sharing YouTube videos, revealing that 21% of post titles are minimally modified. Statistical analysis demonstrates that title rewrites measurably improve engagement. Second, we design a controlled, multi-phase experiment to rigorously isolate the effects of textual variations by neutralizing confounding factors like video popularity, timing, and community norms. Comprehensive statistical tests reveal that effective title rewrites tend to feature emotional resonance, lexical richness, and alignment with community-specific norms. Lastly, pairwise ranking prediction experiments using a fine-tuned BERT classifier achieves 74% accuracy, significantly outperforming near-random baselines, including GPT-4o. These results validate that our controlled dataset effectively minimizes confounding effects, allowing advanced models to both learn and demonstrate the impact of textual features on engagement. By bridging quantitative rigor with qualitative insights, this study uncovers engagement dynamics and offers a robust framework for future cross-platform, multimodal content strategies."
2505.03772,"Online platforms have sanctioned individuals and communities associated with fringe movements linked to hate speech, violence, and terrorism, but can these sanctions contribute to the abandonment of these movements? Here, we investigate this question through the lens of exredpill, a recovery community on Reddit meant to help individuals leave movements within the Manosphere, a conglomerate of fringe Web based movements focused on men's issues. We conduct an observational study on the impact of sanctioning some of Reddit's largest Manosphere communities on the activity levels and user influx of exredpill, the largest associated recovery subreddit. We find that banning a related radical community positively affects participation in exredpill in the period following the ban. Yet, quarantining the community, a softer moderation intervention, yields no such effects. We show that the effect induced by banning a radical community is stronger than for some of the widely discussed real-world events related to the Manosphere and that moderation actions against the Manosphere do not cause a spike in toxicity or malicious activity in exredpill. Overall, our findings suggest that content moderation acts as a deradicalization catalyst."
2505.03773,"This study investigates gender-based differences in online communication patterns of academics, focusing on how male and female academics represent themselves and how users interact with them on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). We collect historical Twitter data of academics in computer science at the top 20 USA universities and analyze their tweets, retweets, and replies to uncover systematic patterns such as discussed topics, engagement disparities, and the prevalence of negative language or harassment. The findings indicate that while both genders discuss similar topics, men tend to post more tweets about AI innovation, current USA society, machine learning, and personal perspectives, whereas women post slightly more on engaging AI events and workshops. Women express stronger positive and negative sentiments about various events compared to men. However, the average emotional expression remains consistent across genders, with certain emotions being more strongly associated with specific topics. Writing-style analysis reveals that female academics show more empathy and are more likely to discuss personal problems and experiences, with no notable differences in other factors, such as self-praise, politeness, and stereotypical comments. Analyzing audience responses indicates that female academics are more frequently subjected to severe toxic and threatening replies. Our findings highlight the impact of gender in shaping the online communication of academics and emphasize the need for a more inclusive environment for scholarly engagement."
2505.03795,"Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast several methods for learning, from a small data set, models of human behavior in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human behavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the moments they model (mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method, called hCAB, models the distribution of human behavior rather than the mean and assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When applied to small societies (6-11 individuals), the hCAB model closely mirrors the population dynamics of human groups (with notable differences). Additionally, in a user study, human participants were unable to distinguish individual hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that the hCAB model also produces plausible (individual) human behavior in this strategic network game."
2505.03813,"Social media platforms shape climate action discourse. Mapping these online conversations is essential for effective communication strategies. TikTok's climate discussions are particularly relevant given its young, climate-concerned audience. In this work, we collect the first TikTok dataset on climate topics. We collected 590K videos from 14K creators along with their follower networks. By applying topic modeling to the video descriptions, we map the topics discussed on the platform on a climate taxonomy that we construct by consolidating existing categorizations. Results show TikTok creators primarily approach climate through the angle of lifestyle and dietary choices. By examining semantic connections between topics, we identified non-climate ""gateway"" topics that could draw new audiences into climate discussions."
2505.03816,"Urban transportation plays a vital role in modern city life, affecting how efficiently people and goods move around. This study analyzes transportation patterns using two datasets: the NYC Taxi Trip dataset from New York City and the Pathao Food Trip dataset from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Our goal is to identify key trends in demand, peak times, and important geographical hotspots. We start with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the basic characteristics of the datasets. Next, we perform geospatial analysis to map out high-demand and low-demand regions. We use the SARIMAX model for time series analysis to forecast demand patterns, capturing seasonal and weekly variations. Lastly, we apply clustering techniques to identify significant areas of high and low demand. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing fleet management and resource allocation in both passenger transport and food delivery services. These insights can help improve service efficiency, better meet customer needs, and enhance urban transportation systems in diverse urban environments."
2505.03847,"Public events, such as music concerts and fireworks displays, can cause irregular surges in cross-city travel demand, leading to potential overcrowding, travel delays, and public safety concerns. To better anticipate and accommodate such demand surges, it is essential to estimate cross-city visitor flows with awareness of public events. Although prior studies typically focused on the effects of a single mega event or disruptions around a single venue, this study introduces a generalizable framework to analyze visitor flows under diverse and concurrent events. We propose to leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract event features from multi-source online information and massive user-generated content on social media platforms. Specifically, social media popularity metrics are designed to capture the effects of online promotion and word-of-mouth in attracting visitors. An event-aware machine learning model is then adopted to uncover the specific impacts of different event features and ultimately predict visitor flows for upcoming events. Using Hong Kong as a case study, the framework is applied to predict daily flows of mainland Chinese visitors arriving at the city, achieving a testing R-squared of over 85%. We further investigate the heterogeneous event impacts on visitor numbers across different event types and major travel modes. Both promotional popularity and word-of-mouth popularity are found to be associated with increased visitor flows, but the specific effects vary by the event type. This association is more pronounced among visitors arriving by metro and high-speed rail, while it has less effect on air travelers. The findings can facilitate coordinated measures across government agencies and guide specialized transport policies, such as shuttle transit services to event venues, and comprehensive on-site traffic management strategies."
2505.04028,"This work examines the influence of misinformation and the role of AI agents, called bots, on social network platforms. To quantify the impact of misinformation, it proposes two new metrics based on attributes of tweet engagement and user network position: Appeal, which measures the popularity of the tweet, and Scope, which measures the potential reach of the tweet. In addition, it analyzes 5.8 million misinformation tweets on the COVID-19 vaccine discourse over three time periods: Pre-Vaccine, Vaccine Launch, and Post-Vaccine. Results show that misinformation was more prevalent during the first two periods. Human-generated misinformation tweets tend to have higher appeal and scope compared to bot-generated ones. Tweedie regression analysis reveals that human-generated misinformation tweets were most concerning during Vaccine Launch week, whereas bot-generated misinformation reached its highest appeal and scope during the Pre-Vaccine period."
2505.04136,"We develop and apply epistemic tests to various decentralized governance methods as well as to study the impact of participation. These tests probe the ability to reach a correct outcome when there is one. We find that partial abstention is a strong governance method from an epistemic standpoint compared to alternatives such as various forms of ``transfer delegation"" in which voters explicitly transfer some or all of their voting rights to others. We make a stronger case for multi-step transfer delegation than is present in previous work but also demonstrate that transfer delegation has inherent epistemic weaknesses. We show that enhanced direct participation, voters exercising their own voting rights, can have a variety of epistemic impacts, some very negative. We identify governance conditions under which additional direct participation is guaranteed to do no epistemic harm and is likely to increase the probability of making correct decisions. In light of the epistemic challenges of voting-based decentralized governance, we consider the possible supplementary use of prediction markets, auctions, and AI agents to improve outcomes. All these results are significant because epistemic performance matters if entities such as DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) wish to compete with organizations that are more centralized."
2505.04215,"Hypergraph has been selected as a powerful candidate for characterizing higher-order networks and has receivedincreasing attention in recent years. In this article, we study random walks with resetting on hypergraph by utilizingspectral theory. Specifically, we derive exact expressions for some fundamental yet key parameters, including occupationprobability, stationary distribution, and mean first passage time, all of which are expressed in terms of the eigenvaluesand eigenvectors of the transition matrix. Furthermore, we provide a general condition for determining the optimalreset probability and a sufficient condition for its existence. In addition, we build up a close relationship betweenrandom walks with resetting on hypergraph and simple random walks. Concretely, the eigenvalues and eigenvectorsof the former can be precisely represented by those of the latter. More importantly, when considering random walks,we abandon the traditional approach of converting hypergraph into a graph and propose a research framework thatpreserves the intrinsic structure of hypergraph itself, which is based on assigning proper weights to neighboring nodes.Through extensive experiments, we show that the new framework produces distinct and more reliable results thanthe traditional approach in node ranking. Finally, we explore the impact of the resetting mechanism on cover time,providing a potential solution for optimizing search efficiency."
2505.04472,"In this paper, we make use of graphon theory to study opinion dynamics on large undirected networks. The opinion dynamics models that we take into consideration allow for negative interactions between the individuals, whose opinions can thus grow apart. We consider both the repelling and the opposing models of negative interactions, which have been studied in the literature. We define the repelling and the opposing dynamics on signed graphons and we show that their initial value problem solutions exist and are unique. We then show that, in a suitable sense, the graphon dynamics is a good approximation of the dynamics on large graphs that converge to a graphon. This result applies to large random graphs that are sampled according to a graphon (W-random graphs), for which we provide a new convergence result under very general assumptions."
2505.04561,"In this work we collected and analyzed social media posts to investigate aesthetic-based radicalization where users searching for Cottagecore content may find Tradwife content co-opted by white supremacists, white nationalists, or other far-right extremist groups. Through quantitative analysis of over 200,000 Tumblr posts and qualitative coding of about 2,500 Tumblr posts, we did not find evidence of a explicit radicalization. We found that problematic Tradwife posts found in the literature may be confined to Tradwife-only spaces, while content in the Cottagecore tag generally did not warrant extra moderation. However, we did find evidence of a mainstreaming effect in the overlap between the Tradwife and Cottagecore communities. In our qualitative analysis there was more interaction between queer and Tradwife identities than expected based on the literature, and some Tradwives even explicitly included queer people and disavowed racism in the Tradwife community on Tumblr. This could be genuine, but more likely it was an example of extremists re-branding their content and following platform norms to spread ideologies that would otherwise be rejected by Tumblr users. Additionally, through temporal analysis we observed a change in the central tags used by Tradwives in the Cottagecore tag pre- and post- 2021. Initially these posts focused on aesthetics and hobbies like baking and gardening, but post-2021 the central tags focused more on religion, traditional gender roles, and homesteading, all markers of reactionary ideals."
2505.04967,"Hypergraphs, capable of representing high-order interactions via hyperedges, have become a powerful tool for modeling real-world biological and social systems. Inherent relationships within these real-world systems, such as the encoding relationship between genes and their protein products, drive the establishment of interconnections between multiple hypergraphs. Here, we demonstrate how to utilize those interconnections between multiple hypergraphs to synthesize integrated information from multiple higher-order systems, thereby enhancing understanding of underlying structures. We propose a model based on the stochastic block model, which integrates information from multiple hypergraphs to reveal latent high-order structures. Real-world hyperedges exhibit preferential attachment, where certain nodes dominate hyperedge formation. To characterize this phenomenon, our model introduces hyperedge internal degree to quantify nodes' contributions to hyperedge formation. This model is capable of mining communities, predicting missing hyperedges of arbitrary sizes within hypergraphs, and inferring inter-hypergraph edges between hypergraphs. We apply our model to high-order datasets to evaluate its performance. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance of our model in community detection, hyperedge prediction, and inter-hypergraph edge prediction tasks. Moreover, we show that our model enables analysis of multiple hypergraphs of different types and supports the analysis of a single hypergraph in the absence of inter-hypergraph edges. Our work provides a practical and flexible tool for analyzing multiple hypergraphs, greatly advancing the understanding of the organization in real-world high-order systems."
2505.05816,"We investigate privacy-preserving spectral clustering for community detection within stochastic block models (SBMs). Specifically, we focus on edge differential privacy (DP) and propose private algorithms for community recovery. Our work explores the fundamental trade-offs between the privacy budget and the accurate recovery of community labels. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic conditions that guarantee the accuracy of our methods, providing theoretical assurances for successful community recovery under edge DP."
2505.05965,"Community detection in networks with overlapping structures remains a significant challenge, particularly in noisy real-world environments where integrating topology, node attributes, and prior information is critical. To address this, we propose a semi-supervised graph autoencoder that combines graph multi-head attention and modularity maximization to robustly detect overlapping communities. The model learns semantic representations by fusing structural, attribute, and prior knowledge while explicitly addressing noise in node features. Key innovations include a noise-resistant architecture and a semantic semi-supervised design optimized for community quality through modularity constraints. Experiments demonstrate superior performance the model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in overlapping community detection (improvements in NMI and F1-score) and exhibits exceptional robustness to attribute noise, maintaining stable performance under 60\% feature corruption. These results highlight the importance of integrating attribute semantics and structural patterns for accurate community discovery in complex networks."
2505.06184,"Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks like misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring, and user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability, produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements, which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X) dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles."
2505.06254,"The OpenSky Network has been collecting and providing crowdsourced air traffic surveillance data since 2013. The network has primarily focused on Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Broadcast (ADS-B) data, which provides high-frequency position updates over terrestrial areas. However, the ADS-B signals are limited over oceans and remote regions, where ground-based receivers are scarce. To address these coverage gaps, the OpenSky Network has begun incorporating data from the Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Contract (ADS-C) system, which uses satellite communication to track aircraft positions over oceanic regions and remote areas. In this paper, we analyze a dataset of over 720,000 ADS-C messages collected in 2024 from around 2,600 unique aircraft via the Alphasat satellite, covering Europe, Africa, and parts of the Atlantic Ocean. We present our approach to combining ADS-B and ADS-C data to construct detailed long-haul flight paths, particularly for transatlantic and African routes. Our findings demonstrate that this integration significantly improves trajectory reconstruction accuracy, allowing for better fuel consumption and emissions estimates. We illustrate how combined data captures flight patterns across previously underrepresented regions across Africa. Despite coverage limitations, this work marks an important advancement in providing open access to global flight trajectory data, enabling new research opportunities in air traffic management, environmental impact assessment, and aviation safety."
2505.06612,"In the era of rapid development of social media, social recommendation systems as hybrid recommendation systems have been widely applied. Existing methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item interaction network for further improving social recommendation. To address these issues, we introduce a social \underline{r}ecommendation model with ro\underline{bu}st g\underline{r}aph denoisin\underline{g}-augmentation fusion and multi-s\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference, respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling, we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art models."
2505.06719,"Understanding how information, diseases, or influence spread across networks is a fundamental challenge in complex systems. While network diameter has been extensively studied in static networks, its definition and behavior in temporal networks remain underexplored due to their dynamic nature. In this study, we present a formal mathematical framework for analyzing diameter in temporal networks and introduce three time-aware metrics: Effective Diameter , Peak Diameter (*D), and t-Diameter (tD), each capturing distinct temporal aspects of connectivity and diffusion. Our approach combines theoretical analysis with empirical validation using four real-world datasets: high school, hospital, conference, and workplace contact networks. We simulate flow propagation on temporal networks and compare the observed diameters with the proposed theoretical Equations. Across all datasets, our model demonstrates high accuracy, with low RMSE and absolute error values. Furthermore, we observe that the effective diameter decreases with increasing average degree and increases with network size. The results also show that tD and *D are more sensitive to node removal, highlighting their relevance for applications such as epidemic modeling. By bridging formal modeling and empirical data, our framework offers new insights into the temporal dynamics of networked systems and provides tools for assessing robustness, controlling information spread, and optimizing interventions in time-sensitive environments."
2505.06998,"The study of interlayer similarity of multiplex networks helps to understand the intrinsic structure of complex systems, revealing how changes in one layer can propagate and affect others, thus enabling broad implications for transportation, social, and biological systems. Existing algorithms that measure similarity between network layers typically encode only partial information, which limits their effectiveness in capturing the full complexity inherent in multiplex networks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel interlayer similarity measuring approach named Embedding Aided inTerlayer Similarity (EATSim). EATSim concurrently incorporates intralayer structural similarity and cross-layer anchor node alignment consistency, providing a more comprehensive framework for analyzing interconnected systems. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that EATSim effectively captures the underlying geometric similarities between interconnected networks, significantly improving the accuracy of interlayer similarity measurement. Moreover, EATSim achieves state-of-the-art performance in two downstream applications: predicting network robustness and network reducibility, showing its great potential in enhancing the understanding and management of complex systems."
2505.07212,"State-sponsored influence operations (SIOs) have become a pervasive and complex challenge in the digital age, particularly on social media platforms where information spreads rapidly and with minimal oversight. These operations are strategically employed by nation-state actors to manipulate public opinion, exacerbate social divisions, and project geopolitical narratives, often through the dissemination of misleading or inflammatory content. Despite increasing awareness of their existence, the specific linguistic and emotional strategies employed by these campaigns remain underexplored. This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of sentiment, emotional valence, and abusive language across 2 million tweets attributed to influence operations linked to China, Iran, and Russia, using Twitter's publicly released dataset of state-affiliated accounts. We identify distinct affective and rhetorical patterns that characterize each nation's digital propaganda. Russian campaigns predominantly deploy negative sentiment and toxic language to intensify polarization and destabilize discourse. In contrast, Iranian operations blend antagonistic and supportive tones to simultaneously incite conflict and foster ideological alignment. Chinese activities emphasize positive sentiment and emotionally neutral rhetoric to promote favorable narratives and subtly influence global perceptions. These findings reveal how state actors tailor their information warfare tactics to achieve specific geopolitical objectives through differentiated content strategies."
2505.07606,"This article addresses the disconnect between the individual policy documents of Mastodon instances--many of which explicitly prohibit data collection for research purposes--and the actual data handling practices observed in academic research involving Mastodon. We present a systematic analysis of 29 works that used Mastodon as a data source, revealing limited adherence to instance--level policies despite researchers' general awareness of their existence. Our findings underscore the need for broader discussion about ethical obligations in research on alternative, decentralized social media platforms."
2505.07646,"The existence of polarization and echo chambers has been noted in social media discussions of public concern such as the Covid-19 pandemic, foreign election interference, and regional conflicts. However, measuring polarization and assessing the manner in which polarization contributes to partisan behavior is not always possible to evaluate with static network or affect measurements. To address this, we conduct an analysis of two large Twitter datasets collected around Covid-19 vaccination and the Ukraine war to investigate polarization in terms of the evolution in influencer preferences and toxicity of post contents. By reducing retweet behavior in each sample to several key dimensions, we identify clusters that reflect ideological preferences, along with geographic or linguistic separation for some cases. By tracking the central retweet tendency of these clusters over time, we observe differences in the relative position of ideologically unaligned clusters compared to aligned ones, which we interpret as reflecting polarization dynamics in the information diffusion space. We then measure the toxicity of posts and test if toxicity in one cluster can be temporally dependent on its structural closeness to (or toxicity of) another. We find evidence of ideological opposition among clusters of users in both samples, and a temporal association between toxicity and structural divergence for at least two ideologically opposed clusters in our samples. These observations support the importance of analyzing polarization as a multifaceted dynamic phenomenon where polarization dynamics may also manifest in unexpected ways such as within a single ideological camp."
2505.08052,"This study formalizes a computational model to simulate classical Persian poets' dynamics of influence through constructing a multi-dimensional similarity network. Using a rigorously curated dataset based on Ganjoor's corpus, we draw upon semantic, lexical, stylistic, thematic, and metrical features to demarcate each poet's corpus. Each is contained within weighted similarity matrices, which are then appended to generate an aggregate graph showing poet-to-poet influence. Further network investigation is carried out to identify key poets, style hubs, and bridging poets by calculating degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector, and Katz centrality measures. Further, for typological insight, we use the Louvain community detection algorithm to demarcate clusters of poets sharing both style and theme coherence, which correspond closely to acknowledged schools of literature like Sabk-e Hindi, Sabk-e Khorasani, and the Bazgasht-e Adabi phenomenon. Our findings provide a new data-driven view of Persian literature distinguished between canonical significance and interextual influence, thus highlighting relatively lesser-known figures who hold great structural significance. Combining computational linguistics with literary study, this paper produces an interpretable and scalable model for poetic tradition, enabling retrospective reflection as well as forward-looking research within digital humanities."
2505.08251,"We study the problem of community recovery in geometrically-noised stochastic block models (SBM). This work presents two primary contributions: (1) Motif--Attention Spectral Operator (MASO), an attention-based spectral operator that improves upon traditional spectral methods; and (2) Iterative Geometric Denoising (GeoDe), a configurable denoising algorithm that boosts spectral clustering performance. We demonstrate that the fusion of GeoDe+MASO significantly outperforms existing community detection methods on noisy SBMs. Furthermore, we show that using GeoDe+MASO as a denoising step improves belief propagation's community recovery by 79.7% on the Amazon Metadata dataset."
2505.08354,"Information diffusion on social media platforms is often assumed to occur primarily through explicit social connections, such as follower or friend relationships. However, information frequently propagates beyond these observable ties -- via external websites, search engines, or algorithmic recommendations -- forming implicit links between users who are not directly connected. Despite their potential impact, the mechanisms and characteristics of such implicit-link diffusion remain underexplored. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of nontrivial information diffusion mediated by implicit links on Twitter, using four large-scale datasets. We define implicit-link diffusion as the reposting of content by users who are not explicitly connected to the original poster. Our analysis reveals that users located farther from the original source in the social network are more likely to engage in diffusion through implicit links, suggesting that such links often arise from sources outside direct social relationships. Moreover, while implicit links contribute less to the overall diffusion size than explicit links, they play a distinct role in disseminating content across diverse and topologically distant communities. We further identify user groups who predominantly engage in diffusion through either explicit or implicit links, and demonstrate that the choice of diffusion channel exhibits strong patterns of social homophily. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating implicit-link dynamics into models of information diffusion and social influence."
2505.08359,"News sharing on digital platforms shapes the digital spaces millions of users navigate. Trace data from these platforms also enables researchers to study online news circulation. In this context, research on the types of news shared by users of differential political leaning has received considerable attention. We argue that most existing approaches (i) rely on an overly simplified measurement of political leaning, (ii) consider only the outlet level in their analyses, and/or (iii) study news circulation among partisans by making ex-ante distinctions between partisan and non-partisan news. In this methodological contribution, we introduce a research pipeline that allows a systematic mapping of news sharing both with respect to source and content. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate insights that otherwise remain unnoticed: Diversification of news sharing along the second political dimension; topic-dependent sharing of outlets; some outlets catering different items to different audiences."
2505.08532,"In today's digital environment, the rapid propagation of fake news via social networks poses significant social challenges. Most existing detection methods either employ traditional classification models, which suffer from low interpretability and limited generalization capabilities, or craft specific prompts for large language models (LLMs) to produce explanations and results directly, failing to leverage LLMs' reasoning abilities fully. Inspired by the saying that ""truth becomes clearer through debate,"" our study introduces a novel multi-agent system with LLMs named TruEDebate (TED) to enhance the interpretability and effectiveness of fake news detection. TED employs a rigorous debate process inspired by formal debate settings. Central to our approach are two innovative components: the DebateFlow Agents and the InsightFlow Agents. The DebateFlow Agents organize agents into two teams, where one supports and the other challenges the truth of the news. These agents engage in opening statements, cross-examination, rebuttal, and closing statements, simulating a rigorous debate process akin to human discourse analysis, allowing for a thorough evaluation of news content. Concurrently, the InsightFlow Agents consist of two specialized sub-agents: the Synthesis Agent and the Analysis Agent. The Synthesis Agent summarizes the debates and provides an overarching viewpoint, ensuring a coherent and comprehensive evaluation. The Analysis Agent, which includes a role-aware encoder and a debate graph, integrates role embeddings and models the interactions between debate roles and arguments using an attention mechanism, providing the final judgment."
2505.08797,"This study explores the dynamics of visibility and influence in digital social relations, examining their implications for the emergence of a new symbolic capital. Using a mixedmethods design, the research combined semi-structured interviews with 20 digitally active individuals and quantitative social media data analysis to identify key predictors of digital symbolic capital. Findings reveal that visibility is influenced by content quality, network size, and engagement strategies, while influence depends on credibility, authority, and trust. The study identifies a new form of symbolic capital based on online visibility, influence, and reputation, distinct from traditional forms. The research discusses the ethical implications of these dynamics and suggests future research directions, emphasizing the need to update social theories to account for digital transformations."
2505.09081,"Contemporary approaches to agent-based modeling (ABM) of social systems have traditionally emphasized rule-based behaviors, limiting their ability to capture nuanced dynamics by moving beyond predefined rules and leveraging contextual understanding from LMs of human social interaction. This paper presents SALM (Social Agent LM Framework), a novel approach for integrating language models (LMs) into social network simulation that achieves unprecedented temporal stability in multi-agent scenarios. Our primary contributions include: (1) a hierarchical prompting architecture enabling stable simulation beyond 4,000 timesteps while reducing token usage by 73%, (2) an attention-based memory system achieving 80% cache hit rates (95% CI [78%, 82%]) with sub-linear memory growth of 9.5%, and (3) formal bounds on personality stability. Through extensive validation against SNAP ego networks, we demonstrate the first LLM-based framework capable of modeling long-term social phenomena while maintaining empirically validated behavioral fidelity."
2505.09154,"In real-world social and economic systems, the provisioning of public goods generally entails continuous interactions among individuals, with decisions to cooperate or defect being influenced by dynamic factors such as timing, resource availability, and the duration of engagement. However, the traditional public goods game ignores the asynchrony of the strategy adopted by players in the game. To address this problem, we propose a spatial public goods game that integrates an M/M/1 queueing system to simulate the dynamic flow of player interactions. We use a birth-death process to characterize the stochastic dynamics of this queueing system, with players arriving following a Poisson process and service times being exponentially distributed under a first-come-first-served basis with finite queue capacity. We also incorporate reputation so that players who have cooperated in the past are more likely to be chosen for future interactions. Our research shows that a high arrival rate, low service rate, and the reputation mechanism jointly facilitate the emergence of cooperative individuals in the network, which thus provides an interesting and new perspective for the provisioning of public goods."
2505.09254,"Social media is nearly ubiquitous in modern life, raising concerns about its societal impacts-from mental health and polarization to violence and democratic disruption. Yet research on its causal effects remains inconclusive: observational studies often find concerning associations, while randomized controlled trials (RCTs) tend to yield small, conflicting, or null results. Literature summaries tend to causally prioritize findings from RCTs, often arguing that concerns about social media are overstated. However, like observational studies, RCTs rely on assumptions that can easily be violated in the context of social media, especially regarding societal outcomes at scale. Here, we enumerate and examine the features of social media as a complex system that challenge our ability to infer causality at societal scales. Drawing on insight from disciplines that have faced similar challenges, like climate-science or epidemiology, we propose a path forward that combines the strength of observational and experimental approaches while acknowledging the limitations of each."
2505.09605,"The rise of vaccine hesitancy has caused a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and pertussis, alongside widespread skepticism and refusals of COVID-19 vaccinations. While categorizing individuals as either supportive of or opposed to vaccines provides a convenient dichotomy of vaccine attitudes, vaccine hesitancy is far more complex and dynamic. It involves wavering individuals whose attitudes fluctuate -- those who may exhibit pro-vaccine attitudes at one time and anti-vaccine attitudes at another. Here, we identify and analyze multichrome contagions as potential targets for intervention by leveraging a dataset of known pro-vax and anti-vax Twitter users ($n =135$ million) and a large COVID-19 Twitter dataset ($n = 3.5$ billion; including close analysis of $1,563,472$ unique individuals). We reconstruct an evolving multiplex sentiment landscape using top co-spreading issues, characterizing them as monochrome and multichrome contagions, based on their conceptual overlap with vaccination. We demonstrate switchers as deliberative: they are more moderate, engage with a wider range of topics, and occupy more central positions in their networks. Further examination of their information consumption shows that their discourse often engages with progressive issues such as climate change, which can serve as avenues for multichrome contagion interventions to promote pro-vaccine attitudes. Using data-driven intervention simulations, we demonstrate a paradox of niche connectivity, where multichrome contagions with fragmented, non-overlapping communities generate the highest levels of diffusion for pro-vaccine attitudes. Our work offers insights into harnessing synergistic hitchhiking effect of multichrome contagions to drive desired attitude and behavior changes in network-based interventions, particularly for overcoming vaccine hesitancy."
2505.09665,"Wildfires have become increasingly frequent, irregular, and severe in recent years. Understanding how affected populations perceive and respond during wildfire crises is critical for timely and empathetic disaster response. Social media platforms offer a crowd-sourced channel to capture evolving public discourse, providing hyperlocal information and insight into public sentiment. This study analyzes Reddit discourse during the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires, spanning from the onset of the disaster to full containment. We collect 385 posts and 114,879 comments related to the Palisades and Eaton fires. We adopt topic modeling methods to identify the latent topics, enhanced by large language models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop (HITL) refinement. Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical framework to categorize latent topics, consisting of two main categories, Situational Awareness (SA) and Crisis Narratives (CN). The volume of SA category closely aligns with real-world fire progressions, peaking within the first 2-5 days as the fires reach the maximum extent. The most frequent co-occurring category set of public health and safety, loss and damage, and emergency resources expands on a wide range of health-related latent topics, including environmental health, occupational health, and one health. Grief signals and mental health risks consistently accounted for 60 percentage and 40 percentage of CN instances, respectively, with the highest total volume occurring at night. This study contributes the first annotated social media dataset on the 2025 LA fires, and introduces a scalable multi-layer framework that leverages topic modeling for crisis discourse analysis. By identifying persistent public health concerns, our results can inform more empathetic and adaptive strategies for disaster response, public health communication, and future research in comparable climate-related disaster events."
2505.10197,"Community detection, a vital technology for real-world applications, uncovers cohesive node groups (communities) by leveraging both topological and attribute similarities in social networks. However, existing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) trained to maximize modularity often converge to suboptimal solutions. Additionally, directly using human-labeled communities for training can undermine topological cohesiveness by grouping disconnected nodes based solely on node attributes. We address these issues by proposing a novel Topological and Attributive Similarity-based Community detection (TAS-Com) method. TAS-Com introduces a novel loss function that exploits the highly effective and scalable Leiden algorithm to detect community structures with global optimal modularity. Leiden is further utilized to refine human-labeled communities to ensure connectivity within each community, enabling TAS-Com to detect community structures with desirable trade-offs between modularity and compliance with human labels. Experimental results on multiple benchmark networks confirm that TAS-Com can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art algorithms."
2505.10254,"Major social media platforms increasingly adopt community-based fact-checking to address misinformation on their platforms. While previous research has largely focused on its effect on engagement (e.g., reposts, likes), an understanding of how fact-checking affects a user's follower base is missing. In this study, we employ quasi-experimental methods to causally assess whether users lose followers after their posts are corrected via community fact-checks. Based on time-series data on follower counts for N=3516 community fact-checked posts from X, we find that community fact-checks do not lead to meaningful declines in the follower counts of users who post misleading content. This suggests that followers of spreaders of misleading posts tend to remain loyal and do not view community fact-checks as a sufficient reason to disengage. Our findings underscore the need for complementary interventions to more effectively disincentivize the production of misinformation on social media."
2505.10266,"AI-generated misinformation (e.g., deepfakes) poses a growing threat to information integrity on social media. However, prior research has largely focused on its potential societal consequences rather than its real-world prevalence. In this study, we conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of AI-generated misinformation on the social media platform X. Specifically, we analyze a dataset comprising N=91,452 misleading posts, both AI-generated and non-AI-generated, that have been identified and flagged through X's Community Notes platform. Our analysis yields four main findings: (i) AI-generated misinformation is more often centered on entertaining content and tends to exhibit a more positive sentiment than conventional forms of misinformation, (ii) it is more likely to originate from smaller user accounts, (iii) despite this, it is significantly more likely to go viral, and (iv) it is slightly less believable and harmful compared to conventional misinformation. Altogether, our findings highlight the unique characteristics of AI-generated misinformation on social media. We discuss important implications for platforms and future research."
2505.10471,"Counting $(p,q)$-bicliques in bipartite graphs is crucial for a variety of applications, from recommendation systems to cohesive subgraph analysis. Yet, it remains computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion to exactly count the $(p,q)$-bicliques. In many scenarios, e.g., graph kernel methods, however, exact counts are not strictly required. To design a scalable and high-quality approximate solution, we novelly resort to $(p,q)$-broom, a special spanning tree of the $(p,q)$-biclique, which can be counted via graph coloring and efficient dynamic programming. Based on the intermediate results of the dynamic programming, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm to derive the approximate $(p,q)$-biclique count from the $(p,q)$-broom counts. Theoretically, our method offers unbiased estimates with provable error guarantees. Empirically, our solution outperforms existing approximation techniques in both accuracy (up to 8$\times$ error reduction) and runtime (up to 50$\times$ speedup) on nine real-world bipartite networks, providing a scalable solution for large-scale $(p,q)$-biclique counting."
2505.10867,"Detecting coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) is central to the study of online influence operations. However, most methods focus on text-centric platforms, leaving video-first ecosystems like TikTok largely unexplored. To address this gap, we develop and evaluate a computational framework for detecting CIB on TikTok, leveraging a network-based approach adapted to the platform's unique content and interaction structures. Building on existing approaches, we construct user similarity networks based on shared behaviors, including synchronized posting, repeated use of similar captions, multimedia content reuse, and hashtag sequence overlap, and apply graph pruning techniques to identify dense networks of likely coordinated accounts. Analyzing a dataset of 793K TikTok videos related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we uncover a range of coordinated activities, from synchronized amplification of political narratives to semi-automated content replication using AI-generated voiceovers and split-screen video formats. Our findings show that while traditional coordination indicators generalize well to TikTok, other signals, such as those based on textual similarity of video transcripts or Duet and Stitch interactions, prove ineffective, highlighting the platform's distinct content norms and interaction mechanics. This work provides the first empirical foundation for studying and detecting CIB on TikTok, paving the way for future research into influence operations in short-form video platforms."
2505.1116,"Video-sharing social media platforms, such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, implement content moderation policies aimed at reducing exposure to harmful videos among minor users. As video has become the dominant and most immersive form of online content, understanding how effectively this medium is moderated for younger audiences is urgent. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of video moderation for different age groups on three of the main video-sharing platforms: TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. We created experimental accounts for the children assigned ages 13 and 18. Using these accounts, we evaluated 3,000 videos served up by the social media platforms, in passive scrolling and search modes, recording the frequency and speed at which harmful videos were encountered. Each video was manually assessed for level and type of harm, using definitions from a unified framework of harmful content.The results show that for passive scrolling or search-based scrolling, accounts assigned to the age 13 group encountered videos that were deemed harmful, more frequently and quickly than those assigned to the age 18 group. On YouTube, 15\% of recommended videos to 13-year-old accounts during passive scrolling were assessed as harmful, compared to 8.17\% for 18-year-old accounts. On YouTube, videos labelled as harmful appeared within an average of 3:06 minutes of passive scrolling for the younger age group. Exposure occurred without user-initiated searches, indicating weaknesses in the algorithmic filtering systems. These findings point to significant gaps in current video moderation practices by social media platforms. Furthermore, the ease with which underage users can misrepresent their age demonstrates the urgent need for more robust verification methods."
2505.11228,"The spreading dynamics in social networks are often studied under the assumption that individuals' statuses, whether informed or infected, are fully observable. However, in many real-world situations, such statuses remain unobservable, which is crucial for determining an individual's potential to further spread the infection. While final statuses are hidden, intermediate indicators such as symptoms of infection are observable and provide useful representations of the underlying diffusion process. We propose a partial observability-aware Machine Learning framework to learn the characteristics of the spreading model. We term the method Distribution Classification, which utilizes the power of classifiers to infer the underlying transmission dynamics. Through extensive benchmarking against Approximate Bayesian Computation and GNN-based baselines, our framework consistently outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering accurate parameter estimates across diverse diffusion settings while scaling efficiently to large networks. We validate the method on synthetic networks and extend the study to a real-world insider trading network, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing spreading phenomena where direct observation of individual statuses is not possible."
2505.11649,"Emotionally responsive social chatbots, such as those produced by Replika andthis http URL, increasingly serve as companions that offer empathy, support, and entertainment. While these systems appear to meet fundamental human needs for connection, they raise concerns about how artificial intimacy affects emotional regulation, well-being, and social norms. Prior research has focused on user perceptions or clinical contexts but lacks large-scale, real-world analysis of how these interactions unfold. This paper addresses that gap by analyzing over 30K user-shared conversations with social chatbots to examine the emotional dynamics of human-AI relationships. Using computational methods, we identify patterns of emotional mirroring and synchrony that closely resemble how people build emotional connections. Our findings show that users-often young, male, and prone to maladaptive coping styles-engage in parasocial interactions that range from affectionate to abusive. Chatbots consistently respond in emotionally consistent and affirming ways. In some cases, these dynamics resemble toxic relationship patterns, including emotional manipulation and self-harm. These findings highlight the need for guardrails, ethical design, and public education to preserve the integrity of emotional connection in an age of artificial companionship."
2505.12145,"Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is crucial for advancing EV adoption, managing charging loads, and ensuring equitable transportation electrification. However, there remains a notable gap in comprehensive accessibility metrics that integrate the mobility of the users. This study introduces a novel accessibility metric, termed Trajectory-Integrated Public EVCS Accessibility (TI-acs), and uses it to assess public electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) accessibility for approximately 6 million residents in the San Francisco Bay Area based on detailed individual trajectory data in one week. Unlike conventional home-based metrics, TI-acs incorporates the accessibility of EVCS along individuals' travel trajectories, bringing insights on more public charging contexts, including public charging near workplaces and charging during grid off-peak periods.As of June 2024, given the current public EVCS network, Bay Area residents have, on average, 7.5 hours and 5.2 hours of access per day during which their stay locations are within 1 km (i.e. 10-12 min walking) of a public L2 and DCFC charging port, respectively. Over the past decade, TI-acs has steadily increased from the rapid expansion of the EV market and charging infrastructure. However, spatial disparities remain significant, as reflected in Gini indices of 0.38 (L2) and 0.44 (DCFC) across census tracts. Additionally, our analysis reveals racial disparities in TI-acs, driven not only by variations in charging infrastructure near residential areas but also by differences in their mobility patterns."
2505.12276,"Community detection in hypergraphs is both instrumental for functional module identification and intricate due to higher-order interactions among nodes. We define a hypergraph Ricci flow that directly operates on higher-order interactions of hypergraphs and prove long-time existence of the flow. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop HyperRCD-a Ricci-flow-based community detection approach that deforms hyperedge weights through curvature-driven evolution, which provides an effective mathematical representation of higher-order interactions mediated by weighted hyperedges between nodes. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world hypergraphs demonstrate that HyperRCD exhibits remarkable enhanced robustness to topological variations and competitive performance across diverse datasets."
2505.1229,"Although we have made progress in understanding disease spread in complex systems with non-Poissonian activity patterns, current models still fail to capture the full range of recovery time distributions. In this paper, we propose an extension of the classic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, called the general recovering process SIS (grp-SIS) model. This model incorporates arbitrary recovery time distributions for infected nodes within the system. We derive the mean-field equations assuming a homogeneous network, provide solutions for specific recovery time distributions, and investigate the probability density function (PDF) for infection times in the system's steady state. Our findings show that recovery time distributions significantly affect disease dynamics, and we suggest several future research directions, including extending the model to arbitrary infection processes and using the quasistationary method to address deviations in numerical results."
2505.12304,"Semi-supervised local community detection aims to leverage known communities to detect the community containing a given node. Although existing semi-supervised local community detection studies yield promising results, they suffer from time-consuming issues, highlighting the need for more efficient algorithms. Therefore, we apply the ""pre-train, prompt"" paradigm to semi-supervised local community detection and propose the Pre-trained Prompt-driven Semi-supervised Local community detection method (PPSL). PPSL consists of three main components: node encoding, sample generation, and prompt-driven fine-tuning. Specifically, the node encoding component employs graph neural networks to learn the representations of nodes and communities. Based on representations of nodes and communities, the sample generation component selects known communities that are structurally similar to the local structure of the given node as training samples. Finally, the prompt-driven fine-tuning component leverages these training samples as prompts to guide the final community prediction. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that PPSL outperforms baselines in both community quality and efficiency."
2505.12309,"Real-world networks often involve both keywords and locations, along with travel time variations between locations due to traffic conditions. However, most existing cohesive subgraph-based community search studies utilize a single attribute, either keywords or locations, to identify communities. They do not simultaneously consider both keywords and locations, which results in low semantic or spatial cohesiveness of the detected communities, and they fail to account for variations in travel time. Additionally, these studies traverse the entire network to build efficient indexes, but the detected community only involves nodes around the query node, leading to the traversal of nodes that are not relevant to the community. Therefore, we propose the problem of discovering semantic-spatial aware k-core, which refers to a k-core with high semantic and time-dependent spatial cohesiveness containing the query node. To address this problem, we propose an exact and a greedy algorithm, both of which gradually expand outward from the query node. They are local methods that only access the local part of the attributed network near the query node rather than the entire network. Moreover, we design a method to calculate the semantic similarity between two keywords using large language models. This method alleviates the disadvantages of keyword-matching methods used in existing community search studies, such as mismatches caused by differently expressed synonyms and the presence of irrelevant words. Experimental results show that the greedy algorithm outperforms baselines in terms of structural, semantic, and time-dependent spatial cohesiveness."
2505.12535,"Keeping track of how lawmakers vote is essential for government transparency. While many parliamentary voting records are available online, they are often difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand legislative behavior across parliaments and predict voting outcomes. Accurate prediction of votes has several potential benefits, from simplifying parliamentary work by filtering out bills with a low chance of passing to refining proposed legislation to increase its likelihood of approval. In this study, we leverage advanced machine learning and data analysis techniques to develop a comprehensive framework for predicting parliamentary voting outcomes across multiple legislatures. We introduce the Voting Prediction Framework (VPF) - a data-driven framework designed to forecast parliamentary voting outcomes at the individual legislator level and for entire bills. VPF consists of three key components: (1) Data Collection - gathering parliamentary voting records from multiple countries using APIs, web crawlers, and structured databases; (2) Parsing and Feature Integration - processing and enriching the data with meaningful features, such as legislator seniority, and content-based characteristics of a given bill; and (3) Prediction Models - using machine learning to forecast how each parliament member will vote and whether a bill is likely to pass. The framework will be open source, enabling anyone to use or modify the framework. To evaluate VPF, we analyzed over 5 million voting records from five countries - Canada, Israel, Tunisia, the United Kingdom and the USA. Our results show that VPF achieves up to 85% precision in predicting individual votes and up to 84% accuracy in predicting overall bill outcomes. These findings highlight VPF's potential as a valuable tool for political analysis, policy research, and enhancing public access to legislative decision-making."
2505.12894,"Hypergraphs offer superior modeling capabilities for social networks, particularly in capturing group phenomena that extend beyond pairwise interactions in rumor propagation. Existing approaches in rumor source detection predominantly focus on dyadic interactions, which inadequately address the complexity of more intricate relational structures. In this study, we present a novel approach for Source Detection in Hypergraphs (HyperDet) via Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion. Specifically, our methodology employs an Interactive Relationship Construction module to accurately model both the static topology and dynamic interactions among users, followed by the Feature-rich Attention Fusion module, which autonomously learns node features and discriminates between nodes using a self-attention mechanism, thereby effectively learning node representations under the framework of accurately modeled higher-order relationships. Extensive experimental validation confirms the efficacy of our HyperDet approach, showcasing its superiority relative to current state-of-the-art methods."
2505.1291,"Source detection on graphs has demonstrated high efficacy in identifying rumor origins. Despite advances in machine learning-based methods, many fail to capture intrinsic dynamics of rumor propagation. In this work, we present SourceDetMamba: A Graph-aware State Space Model for Source Detection in Sequential Hypergraphs, which harnesses the recent success of the state space model Mamba, known for its superior global modeling capabilities and computational efficiency, to address this challenge. Specifically, we first employ hypergraphs to model high-order interactions within social networks. Subsequently, temporal network snapshots generated during the propagation process are sequentially fed in reverse order into Mamba to infer underlying propagation dynamics. Finally, to empower the sequential model to effectively capture propagation patterns while integrating structural information, we propose a novel graph-aware state update mechanism, wherein the state of each node is propagated and refined by both temporal dependencies and topological context. Extensive evaluations on eight datasets demonstrate that SourceDetMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches."
2505.12954,"The problem of counting subgraphs or graphlets under local differential privacy is an important challenge that has attracted significant attention from researchers. However, much of the existing work focuses on small graphlets like triangles or $k$-stars. In this paper, we propose a non-interactive, locally differentially private algorithm capable of counting graphlets of any size $k$. When $n$ is the number of nodes in the input graph, we show that the expected $\ell_2$ error of our algorithm is $O(n^{k - 1})$. Additionally, we prove that there exists a class of input graphs and graphlets of size $k$ for which any non-interactive counting algorithm incurs an expected $\ell_2$ error of $\Omega(n^{k - 1})$, demonstrating the optimality of our result. Furthermore, we establish that for certain input graphs and graphlets, any locally differentially private algorithm must have an expected $\ell_2$ error of $\Omega(n^{k - 1.5})$. Our experimental results show that our algorithm is more accurate than the classical randomized response method."
2505.13334,"Measuring social influence is difficult due to the lack of counter-factuals and comparisons. By combining machine learning-based modeling and network science, we present general properties of social value, a recent measure for social influence using synthetic control applicable to political behavior. Social value diverges from centrality measures on in that it relies on an external regressor to predict an output variable of interest, generates a synthetic measure of influence, then distributes individual contribution based on a social network. Through theoretical derivations, we show the properties of SV under linear regression with and without interaction, across lattice networks, power-law networks, and random graphs. A reduction in computation can be achieved for any ensemble model. Through simulation, we find that the generalized friendship paradox holds -- that in certain situations, your friends have on average more influence than you do."
2505.13354,"This paper presents the first large-scale analysis of public-facing chatbots onthis http URL, a rapidly growing social media platform where users create and interact with chatbots.this http URLis distinctive in that it merges generative AI with user-generated content, enabling users to build bots-often modeled after fictional or public personas-for others to engage with. It is also popular, with over 20 million monthly active users, and impactful, with recent headlines detailing significant issues with youth engagement on the site.this http URLis thus of interest to study both substantively and conceptually. To this end, we present a descriptive overview of the site using a dataset of 2.1 million English-language prompts (or ``greetings'') for chatbots on the site, created by around 1 million users. Our work explores the prevalence of different fandoms on the site, broader tropes that persist across fandoms, and how dynamics of power intersect with gender within greetings. Overall, our findings illuminate an emerging form of online (para)social interaction that toes a unique and important intersection between generative AI and user-generated content."
2505.13894,"In this paper, we provide our milestone ensemble sort work and the first-hand practical experience, Pantheon, which transforms ensemble sorting from a ""human-curated art"" to a ""machine-optimized science"". Compared with formulation-based ensemble sort, our Pantheon has the following advantages: (1) Personalized Joint Training: our Pantheon is jointly trained with the real-time ranking model, which could capture ever-changing user personalized interests accurately. (2) Representation inheritance: instead of the highly compressed Pxtrs, our Pantheon utilizes the fine-grained hidden-states as model input, which could benefit from the Ranking model to enhance our model complexity. Meanwhile, to reach a balanced multi-objective ensemble sort, we further devise an \textbf{iterative Pareto policy optimization} (IPPO) strategy to consider the multiple objectives at the same time. To our knowledge, this paper is the first work to replace the entire formulation-based ensemble sort in industry RecSys, which was fully deployed at Kuaishou live-streaming services, serving 400 Million users daily."
2505.1428,"We investigate the polarization of the German Twittersphere by extracting the main issues discussed and the signaled opinions of users towards those issues based on (re)tweets concerning trending topics. The dataset covers daily trending topics from March 2021 to July 2023. At the opinion level, we show that the online public sphere is largely divided into two camps, one consisting mainly of left-leaning, and another of right-leaning accounts. Further we observe that political issues are strongly aligned, contrary to what one may expect from surveys. This alignment is driven by two cores of strongly active users: influencers, who generate ideologically charged content, and multipliers, who facilitate the spread of this content. The latter are specific to social media and play a crucial role as intermediaries on the platform by curating and amplifying very specific types of content that match their ideological position, resulting in the overall observation of a strongly polarized public sphere. These results contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms that shape online public opinion, and have implications for the regulation of platforms."
2505.14326,"In this paper, we present UKTwitNewsCor, a comprehensive dataset for understanding the content production, dissemination, and audience engagement dynamics of online local media in the UK. It comprises over 2.5 million online news articles published between January 2020 and December 2022 from 360 local outlets. The corpus represents all articles shared on Twitter by the social media accounts of these outlets. We augment the dataset by incorporating social media performance metrics for the articles at the tweet-level. We further augment the dataset by creating metadata about content duplication across domains. Alongside the article dataset, we supply three additional datasets: a directory of local media web domains, one of UK Local Authority Districts, and one of digital local media providers, providing statistics on the coverage scope of UKTwitNewsCor. Our contributions enable comprehensive, longitudinal analysis of UK local media, news trends, and content diversity across multiple platforms and geographic areas. In this paper, we describe the data collection methodology, assess the dataset geographic and media ownership diversity, and outline how researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders can leverage UKTwitNewsCor to advance the study of local media."
2505.14422,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as scalable tools for pilot testing, predicting public opinion distributions before deploying costly surveys. To serve as effective pilot testing tools, the performance of these LLMs is typically benchmarked against their ability to reproduce the outcomes of past structured surveys. This evaluation paradigm, however, is misaligned with the dynamic, context-rich social media environments where public opinion is increasingly formed and expressed. By design, surveys strip away the social, cultural, and temporal context that shapes public opinion, and LLM benchmarks built on this paradigm inherit these critical limitations. To bridge this gap, we introduce MindVote, the first benchmark for public opinion distribution prediction grounded in authentic social media discourse. MindVote is constructed from 3,918 naturalistic polls sourced from Reddit and Weibo, spanning 23 topics and enriched with detailed annotations for platform, topical, and temporal context. Using this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 15 LLMs. MindVote provides a robust, ecologically valid framework to move beyond survey-based evaluations and advance the development of more socially intelligent AI systems."
2505.14453,"Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising potential in fake news detection, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulations within social networks. Existing methods primarily establish connections between malicious accounts and individual target news to investigate the vulnerability of graph-based detectors, while they neglect the structural relationships surrounding targets, limiting their effectiveness in robustness evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel Structural Information principles-guided Adversarial Attack Framework, namely SI2AF, which effectively challenges graph-based detectors and further probes their detection robustness. Specifically, structural entropy is introduced to quantify the dynamic uncertainty in social engagements and identify hierarchical communities that encompass all user accounts and news posts. An influence metric is presented to measure each account's probability of engaging in random interactions, facilitating the design of multiple agents that manage distinct malicious accounts. For each target news, three attack strategies are developed through multi-agent collaboration within the associated subgraph to optimize evasion against black-box detectors. By incorporating the adversarial manipulations generated by SI2AF, we enrich the original network structure and refine graph-based detectors to improve their robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SI2AF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in attack effectiveness with an average improvement of 16.71%, and enhances GNN-based detection robustness by 41.54% on average."
2505.15118,"Cohesive subgraph mining is a fundamental problem in graph theory with numerous real-world applications, such as social network analysis and protein-protein interaction modeling. Among various cohesive subgraphs, the $\gamma$-quasi-clique is widely studied for its flexibility in requiring each vertex to connect to at least a $\gamma$ proportion of other vertices in the subgraph. However, solving the maximum $\gamma$-quasi-clique problem is NP-hard and further complicated by the lack of the hereditary property, which makes designing efficient pruning strategies challenging. Existing algorithms, such as DDA and FastQC, either struggle with scalability or exhibit significant performance declines for small values of $\gamma$. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, IterQC, which reformulates the maximum $\gamma$-quasi-clique problem as a series of $k$-plex problems that possess the hereditary property. IterQC introduces a non-trivial iterative framework and incorporates two key optimization techniques: (1) the pseudo lower bound (pseudo LB) technique, which leverages information across iterations to improve the efficiency of branch-and-bound searches, and (2) the preprocessing technique that reduces problem size and unnecessary iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterQC achieves up to four orders of magnitude speedup and solves significantly more graph instances compared to state-of-the-art algorithms DDA and FastQC."
2505.15331,"The spread of infectious diseases is often influenced by human mobility across different geographical regions. Although numerous studies have investigated how diseases like SARS and COVID-19 spread from China to various global locations, there remains a gap in understanding how the movement of individuals contributes to disease transmission on a more personal or human-to-human level. Typically, researchers have employed the concept of metapopulation movement to analyze how diseases move from one location to another. This paper shifts focus to the dynamics of disease transmission, incorporating the critical factor of distance between an infected person and a healthy individual during human movement. The study delves into the impact of distance on various parameters of epidemiological dynamics throughout human mobility. Mathematical expressions for important epidemiological metrics, such as the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) and the critical infection rate ($\beta_{critical}$), are derived in relation to the distance between individuals. The results indicate that the proposed model closely aligns with observed patterns of COVID-19 spread based on the analysis done on the available datasets."
2505.1537,"There has been considerable interest in modelling the spread of information on social networks using machine learning models. Here, we consider the problem of predicting the spread of new information, i.e. when a user propagates information about a topic previously unseen by the user. In existing work, information and users are randomly assigned to a test or training set, ensuring that both sets are drawn from the same distribution. In the spread of new information, the problem becomes an out-of-distribution generalisation classification task. Our experimental results reveal that while existing algorithms, which predominantly use features derived from the content of messages, perform well when the training and test distributions are the same, these algorithms perform much worse when the test set is out-of-distribution, i.e. when the topic (hashtag) of the testing data is absent from the training data. We then show that if the message features are supplemented or replaced with features derived from users' profile and past behaviour, the out-of-distribution prediction is greatly improved, with the F1 score increasing from 0.117 to 0.705. Our experimental results suggest that a significant component of reposting behaviour for previously unseen topics can be predicted from users' profile and past behaviour, and is largely content-agnostic."
2505.15831,"The graph alignment problem explores the concept of node correspondence and its optimality. In this paper, we focus on purely geometric graph alignment methods, namely our newly proposed Ricci Matrix Comparison (RMC) and its original form, Degree Matrix Comparison (DMC). To formulate a Ricci-curvature-based graph alignment situation, we start with discussing different ideas of constructing one of the most typical and important topological objects, the torus, and then move on to introducing the RMC based on DMC with theoretical motivations. Lastly, we will present to the reader experimental results on a torus and a complex protein-protein interaction network that indicate the potential of applying a differential-geometric view to graph alignment. Results show that a direct variation of DMC using Ricci curvature can help with identifying holes in tori and aligning line graphs of a complex network at 80-90+% accuracy. This paper contributes a new perspective to the field of graph alignment and partially shows the validity of the previous DMC method."
2505.15834,"Fake news spreads widely on social media, leading to numerous negative effects. Most existing detection algorithms focus on analyzing news content and social context to detect fake news. However, these approaches typically detect fake news based on specific platforms, ignoring differences in propagation characteristics across platforms. In this paper, we introduce the MPPFND dataset, which captures propagation structures across multiple platforms. We also describe the commenting and propagation characteristics of different platforms to show that their social contexts have distinct features. We propose a multi-platform fake news detection model (APSL) that uses graph neural networks to extract social context features from various platforms. Experiments show that accounting for cross-platform propagation differences improves fake news detection performance."
2505.15837,"Wikipedia is one of the most visited websites globally, yet its role beyond its own platform remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of how Wikipedia is referenced across the Web. Using a dataset from Common Crawl, we identify over 90 million Wikipedia links spanning 1.68% of Web domains and examine their distribution, context, and function. Our analysis of English Wikipedia reveals three key findings: (1) Wikipedia is most frequently cited by news and science websites for informational purposes, while commercial websites reference it less often. (2) The majority of Wikipedia links appear within the main content rather than in boilerplate or user-generated sections, highlighting their role in structured knowledge presentation. (3) Most links (95%) serve as explanatory references rather than as evidence or attribution, reinforcing Wikipedia's function as a background knowledge provider. While this study focuses on English Wikipedia, our publicly released Web2Wiki dataset includes links from multiple language editions, supporting future research on Wikipedia's global influence on the Web."
2505.15842,"$\textbf{Graph Coarsening (GC)}$ is a prominent graph reduction technique that compresses large graphs to enable efficient learning and inference. However, existing GC methods generate only one coarsened graph per run and must recompute from scratch for each new coarsening ratio, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Moreover, most prior approaches are tailored to $\textit{homogeneous}$ graphs and fail to accommodate the semantic constraints of $\textit{heterogeneous}$ graphs, which comprise multiple node and edge types. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that combines Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with Consistent Hashing to enable $\textit{adaptive graph coarsening}$. Leveraging hashing techniques, our method is inherently fast and scalable. For heterogeneous graphs, we propose a $\textit{type isolated coarsening}$ strategy that ensures semantic consistency by restricting merges to nodes of the same type. Our approach is the first unified framework to support both adaptive and heterogeneous coarsening. Extensive evaluations on 23 real-world datasets including homophilic, heterophilic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous graphs demonstrate that our method achieves superior scalability while preserving the structural and semantic integrity of the original graph."
2505.15857,"As large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate as autonomous agents in social contexts, evaluating their capacity for prosocial behavior is both theoretically and practically critical. However, existing research has primarily relied on static, economically framed paradigms, lacking models that capture the dynamic evolution of prosociality and its sensitivity to structural inequities. To address these gaps, we introduce ProSim, a simulation framework for modeling the prosocial behavior in LLM agents across diverse social conditions. We conduct three progressive studies to assess prosocial alignment. First, we demonstrate that LLM agents can exhibit human-like prosocial behavior across a broad range of real-world scenarios and adapt to normative policy interventions. Second, we find that agents engage in fairness-based third-party punishment and respond systematically to variations in inequity magnitude and enforcement cost. Third, we show that policy-induced inequities suppress prosocial behavior, propagate norm erosion through social networks. These findings advance prosocial behavior theory by elucidating how institutional dynamics shape the emergence, decay, and diffusion of prosocial norms in agent-driven societies."
2505.16079,"Subgraph densities play a crucial role in network analysis, especially for the identification and interpretation of meaningful substructures in complex graphs. Localized subgraph densities, in particular, can provide valuable insights into graph structures. Distinguishing between mathematically-determined and domain-driven subgraph density features, however, poses challenges. For instance, the lack or presence of certain structures can be explained by graph density or degree distribution. These differences are especially meaningful in applied contexts as they allow us to identify instances where the data induces specific network structures, such as friendships in social networks. The goal of this paper is to measure these differences across various types of graphs, conducting social media analysis from a network perspective. To this end, we first provide tighter bounds on subgraph densities. We then introduce the subgraph spread ratio to quantify the realized subgraph densities of specific networks relative to the feasible bounds. Our novel approach combines techniques from flag algebras, motif-counting, and topological data analysis. Crucially, effective adoption of the state-of-the-art in the plain flag algebra method yields feasible regions up to three times tighter than prior best-known results, thereby enabling more accurate and direct comparisons across graphs. We additionally perform an empirical analysis of 11 real-world networks. We observe that social networks consistently have smaller subgraph spread ratios than other types of networks, such as linkage-mapping networks for Wikipedia pages. This aligns with our intuition about social relationships: such networks have meaningful structure that makes them distinct. The subgraph spread ratio enables the quantification of intuitive understandings of network structures and provides a metric for comparing types of networks."
2505.16233,"Real-world complex systems exhibit intricate interconnections and dependencies, especially social networks, technological infrastructures, and communication networks. These networks are prone to disconnection due to random failures or external attacks on their components. Therefore, managing the security and resilience of such networks is a prime concern, particularly at the time of disaster. Therefore, in this research work, network is reconstructed by rewiring/addition of the edges and robustness of the networks is measured. To this aim, two approaches namely (i) Strategic rewiring (ii) budget constrained optimal rewiring are adopted. While current research often assesses robustness by examining the size of the largest connected component, this approach fails to capture the complete spectrum of vulnerability. The failure of a small number of connections leads to a sparser network yet connected network. Thus, the present research work delves deeper into evaluating the robustness of the restored network by evaluating Laplacian Energy to better comprehend the system's behavior during the restoration of the network still considering the size of the largest connected component attacks."
2505.16383,"Wikidata is a collaborative knowledge graph which provides machine-readable structured data for Wikimedia projects including Wikipedia. Managed by a community of volunteers, it has grown to become the most edited Wikimedia project. However, it features a long-tail of items with limited data and a number of systematic gaps within the available content. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic literature review aimed to understand the state of these content gaps within Wikidata. We propose a typology of gaps based on prior research and contribute a theoretical framework intended to conceptualise gaps and support their measurement. We also describe the methods and metrics present used within the literature and classify them according to our framework to identify overlooked gaps that might occur in Wikidata. We then discuss the implications for collaboration and editor activity within Wikidata as well as future research directions. Our results contribute to the understanding of quality, completeness and the impact of systematic biases within Wikidata and knowledge gaps more generally."
2505.17234,"Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports provide detailed analyses of major policy issues to members of the US Congress. We extract and analyze data from 2,010 CRS reports written between 1996 and 2024 in order to quantify the relationships between countries. The data is processed and converted into a weighted graph, representing 172 unique countries as nodes and 4,137 interests as bidirectional edges. Through the Louvain method, we use a greedy algorithm to extract non-overlapping communities from our network and identify clusters with shared interests. We then compute the eigenvector centrality of countries, effectively highlighting their network influence. The results of this work could enable improvements in sourcing evidence for analytic products and understanding the connectivity of our world."
2505.17764,"The role of high-degree nodes, or hubs, in shaping graph dynamics and structure is well-recognized in network science, yet their influence remains underexplored in the context of dynamic graph embedding. Recent advances in representation learning for graphs have shown that random walk-based methods can capture both structural and temporal patterns, but often overlook the impact of hubs on walk trajectories and embedding stability. In this paper, we introduce DeepHub, a method for dynamic graph embedding that explicitly integrates hub sensitivity into random walk sampling strategies. Focusing on dynnode2vec as a representative dynamic embedding method, we systematically analyze the effect of hub-biased walks across nine real-world temporal networks. Our findings reveal that standard random walks tend to overrepresent hub nodes, leading to embeddings that underfit the evolving local context of less-connected nodes. By contrast, hub-aware walks can balance exploration, resulting in embeddings that better preserve temporal neighborhood structure and improve downstream task performance. These results suggest that hub-awareness is an important yet overlooked factor in dynamic graph embedding, and our work provides a foundation for more robust, structure-sensitive representation learning in evolving networks."
2505.18099,"WhatsApp, a platform with more than two billion global users, plays a crucial role in digital communication, but also serves as a vector for harmful content such as misinformation, hate speech, and political propaganda. This study examines the dynamics of harmful message dissemination in WhatsApp groups, with a focus on their structural characteristics. Using a comprehensive data set of more than 5.1 million messages, including text, images, and videos, collected from approximately 6,000 groups in India, we reconstruct message propagation cascades to analyze dissemination patterns. Our findings reveal that harmful messages consistently achieve greater depth and breadth of dissemination compared to messages without harmful annotations, with videos and images emerging as the primary modes of dissemination. These results suggest a distinctive pattern of dissemination of harmful content. However, our analysis indicates that modality alone cannot fully account for the structural differences inthis http URLfindings highlight the critical role of structural characteristics in the spread of these harmful messages, suggesting that strategies targeting structural characteristics of re-sharing could be crucial in managing the dissemination of such content on private messaging platforms."
2505.18432,"User experience significantly impacts pharmaceutical drug effectiveness. Social media platforms, particularly Twitter (now X), have become prominent venues for individuals to share medication-related experiences. This is especially true for semaglutide, a widely marketed drug that has sparked substantial public discourse. Despite the volume of conversation, a comprehensive understanding of how different user subpopulations engage with these discussions remains limited. Understanding such nuanced reactions is crucial for identifying public concerns, addressing misconceptions, and improving health communication. We analyzed 859,751 semaglutide-related tweets collected from July 2021 to April 2024, using sentiment and topic modeling to explore how the drug is perceived across user groups. We applied advanced analytical tools, including RoBERTa and BERTopic, to uncover trends and insights. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive sentiment and topic modeling analysis of semaglutide discourse on Twitter. Findings reveal significant sentiment differences across subpopulations: organizational accounts expressed less negative sentiment (mean -0.014) than individuals (-0.24), especially regarding efficacy and regulatory issues. Sentiment declined notably from Nov 2022 to Jan 2023, coinciding with regulatory alerts. Negativity clustered around access and side effects; positivity stemmed from success stories and endorsements. Female users engaged more with celebrity/political discussions (19.24% vs. 14.6% for males), while males showed slightly higher positivity overall. These insights inform healthcare communication and pharmacovigilance. All data were public and anonymized to ensure privacy and ethical compliance."
2505.1879,"Communication is commonly considered a process that is dynamically situated in a temporal context. However, there remains a disconnection between such theoretical dynamicality and the non-dynamical character of communication scholars' preferred methodologies. In this paper, we argue for a new research framework that uses computational approaches to leverage the fine-grained timestamps recorded in digital trace data. In particular, we propose to maintain the hyper-longitudinal information in the trace data and analyze time-evolving 'user-sequences,' which provide rich information about user activity with high temporal resolution. To illustrate our proposed framework, we present a case study that applied six approaches (e.g., sequence analysis, process mining, and language-based models) to real-world user-sequences containing 1,262,775 timestamped traces from 309 unique users, gathered via data donations. Overall, our study suggests a conceptual reorientation towards a better understanding of the temporal dimension in communication processes, resting on the exploding supply of digital trace data and the technical advances in analytical approaches."
2505.19612,"In many network systems, events at one node trigger further activity at other nodes, e.g., social media users reacting to each other's posts or the clustering of criminal activity in urban environments. These systems are typically referred to as self-exciting networks. In such systems, targeted intervention at critical nodes can be an effective strategy for mitigating undesirable consequences such as further propagation of criminal activity or the spreading of misinformation on social media. In our work, we develop an optimal network intervention model to explore how targeted interventions at critical nodes can mitigate cascading effects throughout a Spatiotemporal Hawkes network. Similar models have been studied previously in the literature in purely temporal Hawkes networks, but in our work, we extend them to a spatiotemporal setup and demonstrate the efficacy of our methods by comparing the post-intervention reduction in intensity to other heuristic strategies in simulated networks. Subsequently, we use our method on crime data from the LA police department database to find neighborhoods for strategic intervention to demonstrate an application in predictive policing."
2505.20067,"Social media platforms have traditionally relied on internal moderation teams and partnerships with independent fact-checking organizations to identify and flag misleading content. Recently, however, platforms including X (formerly Twitter) and Meta have shifted towards community-driven content moderation by launching their own versions of crowd-sourced fact-checking -- Community Notes. If effectively scaled and governed, such crowd-checking initiatives have the potential to combat misinformation with increased scale and speed as successfully as community-driven efforts once did with spam. Nevertheless, general content moderation, especially for misinformation, is inherently more complex. Public perceptions of truth are often shaped by personal biases, political leanings, and cultural contexts, complicating consensus on what constitutes misleading content. This suggests that community efforts, while valuable, cannot replace the indispensable role of professional fact-checkers. Here we systemically examine the current approaches to misinformation detection across major platforms, explore the emerging role of community-driven moderation, and critically evaluate both the promises and challenges of crowd-checking at scale."
2505.20089,"Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs, addressing the challenge of label scarcity. In this paper, we highlight the significance of graph homophily, a pivotal factor for graph domain alignment, which, however, has long been overlooked in existing approaches. Specifically, our analysis first reveals that homophily discrepancies exist in benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that homophily discrepancies degrade GDA performance from both empirical and theoretical aspects, which further underscores the importance of homophily alignment in GDA. Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel homophily alignment algorithm that employs mixed filters to smooth graph signals, thereby effectively capturing and mitigating homophily discrepancies between graphs. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method."
2505.20185,"This study investigates how topics and sentiments on COVID-19 mitigation measures -- specifically lockdowns, mask mandates, and vaccinations -- spread through the Belgian Reddit community. We explore 655,642 posts created between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2022. In line with previous studies for other countries and platforms, we find that the volume of posts on these topics can be tied to important external events, but not within-Reddit interactions. Sentiment, however, is influenced by the sentiment of previous posts, resulting in homophily and polarisation. We define a homophily measure and find values of 0.228, 0.198, and 0.133 for lockdowns, masks and vaccination, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a novel bounded confidence model that estimates internal sentiment of users from their expressed sentiment. The Wasserstein metric between the predicted and the observed sentiments takes values between 0.493 (vaccination) and 0.607 (lockdown). These results yield insight into the way the Belgian Reddit community experienced the pandemic, and which aspects influenced the topics discussed and their associated sentiment."
2505.20378,"Multilayer networks offer a powerful framework for modeling complex systems across diverse domains, effectively capturing multiple types of connections and interdependent subsystems commonly found in real world scenarios. To analyze these networks, embedding techniques that project nodes into a lower-dimensional geometric space are essential. This paper introduces a novel hyperbolic embedding framework that advances the state of the art in multilayer network analysis. Our method, which supports heterogeneous node sets across networks and inter-layer connections, generates layer-specific hyperbolic embeddings, enabling detailed intra-layer analysis and inter-layer comparisons, while simultaneously preserving the global multilayer structure within hyperbolic space, a capability that sets it apart from existing approaches, which typically rely on independent embedding of layers. Through experiments on synthetic multilayer stochastic block models, we demonstrate that our approach effectively preserves community structure, even when layers consist of different node sets. When applied to real brain networks, the method successfully clusters disease-related brain regions from different patients, outperforming layer-independent approaches and highlighting its relevance for comparative analysis. Overall, this work provides a robust tool for multilayer network analysis, enhancing interpretability and offering new insights into the structure and function of complex systems."
2505.20584,"Mpox (formerly monkeypox) is a zoonotic disease caused by an orthopoxvirus closely related to variola and remains a significant global public health concern. During outbreaks, social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) can both inform and misinform the public, complicating efforts to convey accurate health information. To support local response efforts, we developed a researcher-focused dashboard for use by public health stakeholders and the public that enables searching and visualizing mpox-related tweets through an interactive interface. Following the CDC's designation of mpox as an emerging virus in August 2024, our dashboard recorded a marked increase in tweet volume compared to 2023, illustrating the rapid spread of health discourse across digital platforms. These findings underscore the continued need for real-time social media monitoring tools to support public health communication and track evolving sentiment and misinformation trends at the local level."
2505.20929,"Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of human mobility is crucial for addressing societal challenges, such as epidemic control and urban transportation optimization. Despite advancements in data collection, the complexity and scale of mobility data continue to pose significant analytical challenges. Existing methods often result in losing location-specific details and fail to fully capture the intricacies of human movement. This study proposes a two-step dimensionality reduction framework to overcome existing limitations. First, we construct a potential landscape of human flow from origin-destination (OD) matrices using combinatorial Hodge theory, preserving essential spatial and structural information while enabling an intuitive visualization of flow patterns. Second, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the potential landscape, systematically identifying major spatiotemporal patterns. By implementing this two-step reduction method, we reveal significant shifts during a pandemic, characterized by an overall declines in mobility and stark contrasts between weekdays and holidays. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our framework in uncovering complex mobility patterns and provide valuable insights into urban planning and public health interventions."
2505.2098,"Identifying super-spreaders can be framed as a subtask of the influence maximisation problem. It seeks to pinpoint agents within a network that, if selected as single diffusion seeds, disseminate information most effectively. Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social), and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and (iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model, TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning methods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and synthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves superior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering improved interpretability through its structured output."
2505.21388,"Web 2.0 social platforms are inherently centralized, with user data and algorithmic decisions controlled by the platform. However, users can only passively receive social predictions without being able to choose the underlying algorithm, which limits personalization. Fortunately, with the emergence of blockchain, users are allowed to choose algorithms that are tailored to their local situation, improving prediction results in a personalized way. In a blockchain environment, each user possesses its own model to perform the social prediction, capturing different perspectives on social interactions. In our work, we propose DeSocial, a decentralized social network learning framework deployed on an Ethereum (ETH) local development chain that integrates distributed data storage, node-level consensus, and user-driven model selection through Ganache. In the first stage, each user leverages DeSocial to evaluate multiple backbone models on their local subgraph. DeSocial coordinates the execution and returns model-wise prediction results, enabling the user to select the most suitable backbone for personalized social prediction. Then, DeSocial uniformly selects several validation nodes that possess the algorithm specified by each user, and aggregates the prediction results by majority voting, to prevent errors caused by any single model's misjudgment. Extensive experiments show that DeSocial has an evident improvement compared to the five classical centralized social network learning models, promoting user empowerment in blockchain-based decentralized social networks, showing the importance of multi-node validation and personalized algorithm selection based on blockchain. Our implementation is available at:this https URL."
2505.21673,"Predicting the emergence of future research collaborations between authors in academic social networks (SNs) is a very effective example that demonstrates the link prediction problem. This problem refers to predicting the potential existence or absence of a link between a pair of nodes (authors) on the co-authorship network. Various similarity and aggregation metrics were proposed in the literature for predicting the potential link between two authors on such networks. However, the relevant research did not investigate the impact of similarity of research interests of two authors or the similarity of their affiliations on the performance of predicting the potential link between them. Additionally, the impact of the aggregation of the research performance indices of two authors on link prediction performance was not highlighted. To this end, in this paper we propose an integrative supervised learning framework for predicting potential collaboration in co-authorship network based on similarity of the research interests and the similarity of the affiliations of each pair of authors in this network. Moreover, our proposed framework integrates the aggregation of research performance indices of each author pair and the similarity between the two authors nodes with the research interest and affiliation similarity as four metrics for predicting the potential link between each two authors. Our experimental results obtained from applying our proposed link prediction approach to the two largest connected graphs of two huge academic co-authorship networks, namely ArnetMiner and DBLP, show the great performance of this approach in predicting potential links between two authors on large-scale academic SNs."
2505.21706,"Network models have been widely used to study diverse systems and analyze their dynamic behaviors. Given the structural variability of networks, an intriguing question arises: Can we infer the type of system represented by a network based on its structure? This classification problem involves extracting relevant features from the network. Existing literature has proposed various methods that combine structural measurements and dynamical processes for feature extraction. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to characterize networks using statistics from random walks, which can be particularly informative about network properties. We present the employed statistical metrics and compare their performance on multiple datasets with other state-of-the-art feature extraction methods. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in many cases, often outperforming existing approaches, although some limitations are observed across certain datasets."
2505.21729,"Political discourse has grown increasingly fragmented across different social platforms, making it challenging to trace how narratives spread and evolve within such a fragmented information ecosystem. Reconstructing social graphs and information diffusion networks is challenging, and available strategies typically depend on platform-specific features and behavioral signals which are often incompatible across systems and increasingly restricted. To address these challenges, we present a platform-agnostic framework that allows to accurately and efficiently reconstruct the underlying social graph of users' cross-platform interactions, based on discovering latent narratives and users' participation therein. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in key network-based tasks: information operation detection, ideological stance prediction, and cross-platform engagement prediction$\unicode{x2013}$$\unicode{x2013}$while requiring significantly less data than existing alternatives and capturing a broader set of users. When applied to cross-platform information dynamics between Truth Social and X (formerly Twitter), our framework reveals a small, mixed-platform group of $\textit{bridge users}$, comprising just 0.33% of users and 2.14% of posts, who introduce nearly 70% of $\textit{migrating narratives}$ to the receiving platform. These findings offer a structural lens for anticipating how narratives traverse fragmented information ecosystems, with implications for cross-platform governance, content moderation, and policy interventions."
2505.21748,"Complex systems are often driven by higher-order interactions among multiple units, naturally represented as hypergraphs. Understanding dependency structures within these hypergraphs is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems but is made challenging by their combinatorial complexity and computational demands. In this paper, we introduce a class of probabilistic models that efficiently represents and discovers a broad spectrum of mesoscale structure in large-scale hypergraphs. The key insight enabling this approach is to treat classes of similar units as themselves nodes in a latent hypergraph. By modeling observed node interactions through latent interactions among classes using low-rank representations, our approach tractably captures rich structural patterns while ensuring model identifiability. This allows for direct interpretation of distinct node- and class-level structures. Empirically, our model improves link prediction over state-of-the-art methods and discovers interpretable structures in diverse real-world systems, including pharmacological and social networks, advancing the ability to incorporate large-scale higher-order data into the scientific process."
2505.22032,"As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) used Twitter to disseminate safety guidance and updates, reaching millions of users. This study analyzes two years of tweets from, to, and about the CDC using a mixed methods approach to examine discourse characteristics, credibility, and user engagement. We found that the CDCs communication remained largely one directional and did not foster reciprocal interaction, while discussions around COVID19 were deeply shaped by political and ideological polarization. Users frequently cited earlier CDC messages to critique new and sometimes contradictory guidance. Our findings highlight the role of sentiment, media richness, and source credibility in shaping the spread of public health messages. We propose design strategies to help the CDC tailor communications to diverse user groups and manage misinformation more effectively during high-stakes health crises."
2505.22345,"Different types of graphs and complex networks have been characterized, analyzed, and modeled based on measurements of their respective topology. However, the available networks may constitute approximations of the original structure as a consequence of sampling incompleteness, noise, and/or error in the representation of that structure. Therefore, it becomes of particular interest to quantify how successive modifications may impact a set of adopted topological measurements, and how respectively undergone changes can be interrelated, which has been addressed in this paper by considering similarity networks and hierarchical clustering approaches. These studies are developed respectively to several topological measurements (accessibility, degree, hierarchical degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, assortativity, and average shortest path) calculated from complex networks of three main types (Erdős-Rényi, Barabási-Albert, and geographical) with varying sizes or subjected to progressive edge removal or rewiring. The coincidence similarity index, which can implement particularly strict comparisons, is adopted for two main purposes: to quantify and visualize how the considered topological measurements respond to the considered network alterations and to represent hierarchically the relationships between the observed changes undergone by the considered topological measurements. Several results are reported and discussed, including the identification of three types of topological changes taking place as a consequence of the modifications. In addition, the changes observed for the Erdős-Rényi and Barabási-Albert networks resulted mutually more similarly affected by topological changes than for the geometrical networks. The latter type of network has been identified to have more heterogeneous topological features than the other two types of networks."
2505.22684,"Community partitioning is crucial in network analysis, with modularity optimization being the prevailing technique. However, traditional modularity-based methods often overlook fairness, a critical aspect in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce protected group networks and propose a novel fairness-modularity metric. This metric extends traditional modularity by explicitly incorporating fairness, and we prove that minimizing it yields naturally fair partitions for protected groups while maintaining theoretical soundness. We develop a general optimization framework for fairness partitioning and design the efficient Fair Fast Newman (FairFN) algorithm, enhancing the Fast Newman (FN) method to optimize both modularity and fairness. Experiments show FairFN achieves significantly improved fairness and high-quality partitions compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially on unbalanced datasets."
2505.22692,"Accurate forecasting of avian influenza outbreaks within wild bird populations requires models that account for complex, multi-scale transmission patterns driven by various factors. Spatio-temporal GNN-based models have recently gained traction for infection forecasting due to their ability to capture relations and flow between spatial regions, but most existing frameworks rely solely on spatial connections and their connections. This overlooks valuable genetic information at the case level, such as cases in one region being genetically descended from strains in another, which is essential for understanding how infectious diseases spread through epidemiological linkages beyond geography. We address this gap with BLUE, a B}i-Layer heterogeneous graph fUsion nEtwork designed to integrate genetic, spatial, and ecological data for accurate outbreak forecasting. The framework 1) builds heterogeneous graphs from multiple information sources and multiple layers, 2) smooths across relation types, 3) performs fusion while retaining structural patterns, and 4) predicts future outbreaks via an autoregressive graph sequence model that captures transmission dynamics over time. To facilitate further research, we introduce \textbf{Avian-US} dataset, the dataset for avian influenza outbreak forecasting in the United States, incorporating genetic, spatial, and ecological data across locations. BLUE achieves superior performance over existing baselines, highlighting the value of incorporating multi-layer information into infectious disease forecasting."
2505.22962,"Calls to decentralize feed-based social media have been driven by concerns about the concentrated power of centralized platforms and their societal impact. In response, numerous decentralized social media protocols have emerged, each interpreting ""decentralization"" in different ways. We analyze four such protocols -- ActivityPub, AT Protocol, Nostr, and Farcaster -- to develop a novel conceptual framework for understanding how protocols operationalize decentralization. Drawing from protocol documentation, media coverage, and first-hand interviews with protocol developers and experts, we contextualize each protocol's approach within their respective socio-technical goals. Our framework highlights how control over key components is distributed differently across each protocol, shaping who holds power over what kinds of decisions. How components are arranged in relation to one another further impacts how component owners might offset each other's power in shaping social media. We argue that examining protocols as artifacts reveals how values shape infrastructure and power dynamics -- and that with a holistic framework as a guide, we can more effectively evaluate and design decentralized platforms aligned with the social and political futures we envision."
2505.23123,"Offline map matching involves aligning historical trajectories of mobile objects, which may have positional errors, with digital maps. This is essential for applications in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), such as route analysis and traffic pattern mining. Existing methods have two main limitations: (i) they assume a uniform Localization Error Distribution (LED) across urban areas, neglecting environmental factors that lead to suboptimal path search ranges, and (ii) they struggle to efficiently handle local non-shortest paths and detours. To address these issues, we propose a novel offline map matching method for sparse trajectories, called LNSP, which integrates LED modeling and non-shortest path detection. Key innovations include: (i) leveraging public transit trajectories with fixed routes to model LED in finer detail across different city regions, optimizing path search ranges, and (ii) scoring paths using sub-region dependency LED and a sliding window, which reduces global map matching errors. Experimental results using real-world bus and taxi trajectory datasets demonstrate that the LNSP algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in both efficiency and matching accuracy."
2505.23668,"Many real-world networks have associated metadata that assigns categorical labels to nodes. Analysis of these annotations can complement the topological analysis of complex networks. Annotated networks have typically been used to evaluate community detection approaches. Here, we introduce an approach that combines the quantitative analysis of annotations and network structure, which groups nodes according to similar distributions of node annotations in their neighbourhoods. Importantly the nodes that are grouped together, which we call homologues may not be connected to each other at all. By applying our approach to three very different real-world networks we show that these groupings identify common functional roles and properties of nodes in the network."
2505.23691,"The spectral properties of traditional (dyadic) graphs, where an edge connects exactly two vertices, are widely studied in different applications. These spectral properties are closely connected to the structural properties of dyadic graphs. We generalize such connections and characterize higher-order networks by their spectral information. We first split the higher-order graphs by their ``edge orders"" into several uniform hypergraphs. For each uniform hypergraph, we extract the corresponding spectral information from the transition matrices of carefully designed random walks. From each spectrum, we compute the first few spectral moments and use all such spectral moments across different ``edge orders"" as the higher-order graph representation. We show that these moments not only clearly indicate the return probabilities of random walks but are also closely related to various higher-order network properties such as degree distribution and clustering coefficient. Extensive experiments show the utility of this new representation in various settings. For instance, graph classification on higher-order graphs shows that this representation significantly outperforms other techniques."
2505.23826,"Financial markets exhibit complex dynamics where localized events trigger ripple effects across entities. Previous event studies, constrained by static single-company analyses and simplistic assumptions, fail to capture these ripple effects. While large language models (LLMs) offer emergent reasoning capabilities, their direct application falters due to structural market unawareness and limited capacity to analyze ripple effects. We propose FinRipple, an elegant framework that empowers LLMs with the ability to analyze ripple effects through financial theory-guided large-scale reinforcement learning. We begin by relaxing the assumptions of previous methods, incorporating a time-varying knowledge graph to accurately represent market structure. By seamlessly integrating classical asset pricing theory, we align the LLM with the market, enabling it to predict ripple effects. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide a standardized definition of ripple effect prediction, a task that is extremely important yet unexplored in the financial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinRipple provides a promising solution to this task."
2505.24801,"We analyse the migration of 300,000 academic users from Twitter/X to Bluesky between 2023 and early 2025, combining rich bibliometric data, longitudinal social-media activity, and a novel cross-platform identity-matching pipeline. We show that 18% of scholars in our sample transitioned, with transition rates varying sharply by discipline, political expression, and Twitter engagement but not by traditional academic metrics. Using time-varying Cox models and a matched-pairs design, we isolate genuine peer influence from homophily. We uncover a striking asymmetry whereby information sources drive migration far more powerfully than audience, with this influence decaying exponentially within a week. We further develop an ego-level contagion classifier, revealing that simple contagion drives two-thirds of all exits, shock-driven bursts account for 16%, and complex contagion plays a marginal role. Finally, we show that scholars who rebuild a higher fraction of their former Twitter networks on Bluesky remain significantly more active and engaged. Our findings provide new insights onto theories of network externalities, directional influence, and platform migration, highlighting information sources' central role in overcoming switching costs."
2506.01479,"Hypergraphs extend traditional networks by capturing multi-way or group interactions. Given the complexity of hypergraph data and the wide range of methodology available for pairwise network analysis, hypergraph data is often projected onto a weighted and undirected network. The simplest of these projections, often referred to as a node co-occurrence matrix, is known to be non-unique, as distinct non-isomorphic hypergraphs can produce the same weighted adjacency matrix. This non-uniqueness raises important questions about the structural information lost during the projection and how to efficiently quantify the complexity of the original hypergraph. Here we develop a search algorithm to identify all hypergraphs corresponding to a given projection, analyze its runtime, and explore its parallelisability. Applying this algorithm to projections derived from a random hypergraph model, we characterize conditions under which projections are non-unique. Our findings provide a new framework and set of computational tools to investigate projections of hypergraphs."
2506.01642,"This paper examines how emotional responses to football matches influence online discourse across digital spaces on Reddit. By analysing millions of posts from dozens of subreddits, it demonstrates that real-world events trigger sentiment shifts that move across communities. It shows that negative sentiment correlates with problematic language; match outcomes directly influence sentiment and posting habits; sentiment can transfer to unrelated communities; and offers insights into the content of this shifting discourse. These findings reveal how digital spaces function not as isolated environments, but as interconnected emotional ecosystems vulnerable to cross-domain contagion triggered by real-world events, contributing to our understanding of the propagation of online toxicity. While football is used as a case-study to computationally measure affective causes and movements, these patterns have implications for understanding online communities broadly."
2506.01752,"Community detection in complex networks is fundamental across social, biological, and technological domains. While traditional single-objective methods like Louvain and Leiden are computationally efficient, they suffer from resolution bias and structural degeneracy. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) address these limitations by simultaneously optimizing conflicting structural criteria, however, their high computational costs have historically limited their application to small networks. We present HP-MOCD, a High-Performance Evolutionary Multiobjective Community Detection Algorithm built on Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), which overcomes these barriers through topology-aware genetic operators, full parallelization, and bit-level optimizations, achieving theoretical O(GN_p|V|) complexity. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks. Results demonstrate strong scalability, with HP-MOCD processing networks of over 1,000,000 nodes while maintaining high quality across varying noise levels. It outperforms other MOEAs by more than 531 times in runtime on synthetic datasets, achieving runtimes as low as 57 seconds for graphs with 40,000 nodes on moderately powered hardware. Across 14 real-world networks, HP-MOCD was the only MOEA capable of processing the six largest datasets within a reasonable time, with results competitive with single-objective approaches. Unlike single-solution methods, HP-MOCD produces a Pareto Front, enabling individual-specific trade-offs and providing decision-makers with a spectrum of high-quality community structures. It introduces the first open-source Python MOEA library compatible with networkx and igraph for large-scale community detection."
2506.02482,"This project develops an online, inductive recommendation system for newly listed products on e-commerce platforms, focusing on suggesting relevant new items to customers as they purchase other products. Using the Amazon Product Co-Purchasing Network Metadata dataset, we construct a co-purchasing graph where nodes represent products and edges capture co-purchasing relationships. To address the challenge of recommending new products with limited information, we apply a modified GraphSAGE method for link prediction. This inductive approach leverages both product features and the existing co-purchasing graph structure to predict potential co-purchasing relationships, enabling the model to generalize to unseen products. As an online method, it updates in real time, making it scalable and adaptive to evolving product catalogs. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline algorithms in predicting relevant product links, offering a promising solution for enhancing the relevance of new product recommendations in e-commerce environments.

2506.02686,"Real-world networks exhibit universal structural properties such as sparsity, small-worldness, heterogeneous degree distributions, high clustering, and community structures. Geometric network models, particularly Random Hyperbolic Graphs (RHGs), effectively capture many of these features by embedding nodes in a latent similarity space. However, networks are often characterized by specific connectivity patterns between groups of nodes -- i.e. communities -- that are not geometric, in the sense that the dissimilarity between groups do not obey the triangle inequality. Structuring connections only based on the interplay of similarity and popularity thus poses fundamental limitations on the mesoscale structure of the networks that RHGs can generate. To address this limitation, we introduce the Random Hyperbolic Block Model (RHBM), which extends RHGs by incorporating block structures within a maximum-entropy framework. We demonstrate the advantages of the RHBM through synthetic network analyses, highlighting its ability to preserve community structures where purely geometric models fail. Our findings emphasize the importance of latent geometry in network modeling while addressing its limitations in controlling mesoscale mixing patterns."
2506.02706,"Gaming environments are popular testbeds for studying human interactions and behaviors in complex artificial intelligence systems. Particularly, in multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, individuals collaborate in virtual environments of high realism that involves real-time strategic decision-making and trade-offs on resource management, information collection and sharing, team synergy and collective dynamics. This paper explores whether collective intelligence, emerging from cooperative behaviours exhibited by a group of individuals, who are not necessarily skillful but effectively engage in collaborative problem-solving tasks, exceeds individual intelligence observed within skillful individuals. This is shown via a case study in League of Legends, using machine learning algorithms and statistical methods applied to large-scale data collected for the same purpose. By modelling systematically game-specific metrics but also new game-agnostic topological and graph spectra measures of cooperative interactions, we demonstrate compelling insights about the superior performance of collective intelligence."
2506.03105,"Finding densely connected subsets of vertices in an unsupervised setting, called clustering or community detection, is one of the fundamental problems in network science. The edge clustering approach instead detects communities by clustering the edges of the graph and then assigning a vertex to a community if it has at least one edge in that community, thereby allowing for overlapping clusters of vertices. We apply the idea behind edge clustering to temporal hypergraphs, an extension of a graph where a single edge can contain any number of vertices and each edge has a timestamp. Extending to hypergraphs allows for many different patterns of interaction between edges, and by defining a suitable structural similarity function, our edge clustering algorithm can find clusters of these patterns. We test the algorithm with three structural similarity functions on a large collaboration hypergraph, and find intuitive cluster structures that could prove useful for downstream tasks."
2506.03443,"Online political discourse is increasingly shaped not by a few dominant platforms but by a fragmented ecosystem of social media spaces, each with its own user base, target audience, and algorithmic mediation of discussion. Such fragmentation may fundamentally change how polarization manifests online. In this study, we investigate the characteristics of political discourse and polarization on the emerging social media site Bluesky. We collect all activity on the platform between December 2024 and May 2025 to map out the platform's political topic landscape and detect distinct polarization patterns. Our comprehensive data collection allows us to employ a data-driven methodology for identifying political themes, classifying user stances, and measuring both structural and content-based polarization across key topics raised in English-language discussions. Our analysis reveals that approximately 13% of Bluesky posts engage with political content, with prominent topics including international conflicts, U.S. politics, and socio-technological debates. We find high levels of structural polarization across several salient political topics. However, the most polarized topics are also highly imbalanced in the numbers of users on opposing sides, with the smaller group consisting of only 1-2% of the users. While discussions in Bluesky echo familiar political narratives and polarization trends, the platform exhibits a more politically homogeneous user base than was typical prior to the current wave of platform fragmentation."
2506.03491,"Globalization has fundamentally reshaped societal dynamics, influencing how individuals interact and perceive themselves and others. One significant consequence is the evolving landscape of eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa (BN), which are increasingly driven not just by internal psychological factors but by broader sociocultural and digital contexts. While mathematical modeling has provided valuable insights, traditional frameworks often fall short in capturing the nuanced roles of social contagion, digital media, and adaptive behavior. This review synthesizes two decades of quantitative modeling efforts, including compartmental, stochastic, and delay-based approaches. We spotlight foundational work that conceptualizes BN as a socially transmissible condition and identify critical gaps, especially regarding the intensifying impact of social media. Drawing on behavioral epidemiology and the adaptive behavior framework by Fenichel et al., we advocate for a new generation of models that incorporate feedback mechanisms, content-driven influence functions, and dynamic network effects. This work outlines a roadmap for developing more realistic, data-informed models that can guide effective public health interventions in the digital era."
2506.03532,"Social network simulation is developed to provide a comprehensive understanding of social networks in the real world, which can be leveraged for a wide range of applications such as group behavior emergence, policy optimization, and business strategy development. However, billions of individuals and their evolving interactions involved in social networks pose challenges in accurately reflecting real-world complexities. In this study, we propose a comprehensive Social Network Simulation System (GA-S3) that leverages newly designed Group Agents to make intelligent decisions regarding various online events. Unlike other intelligent agents that represent an individual entity, our group agents model a collection of individuals exhibiting similar behaviors, facilitating the simulation of large-scale network phenomena with complex interactions at a manageable computational cost. Additionally, we have constructed a social network benchmark from 2024 popular online events that contains fine-grained information on Internet traffic variations. The experiment demonstrates that our approach is capable of achieving accurate and highly realistic prediction results. Code is open atthis https URL."
2506.0375,"The application of AI in psychiatric diagnosis faces significant challenges, including the subjective nature of mental health assessments, symptom overlap across disorders, and privacy constraints limiting data availability. To address these issues, we present MoodAngels, the first specialized multi-agent framework for mood disorder diagnosis. Our approach combines granular-scale analysis of clinical assessments with a structured verification process, enabling more accurate interpretation of complex psychiatric data. Complementing this framework, we introduce MoodSyn, an open-source dataset of 1,173 synthetic psychiatric cases that preserves clinical validity while ensuring patient privacy. Experimental results demonstrate that MoodAngels outperforms conventional methods, with our baseline agent achieving 12.3% higher accuracy than GPT-4o on real-world cases, and our full multi-agent system delivering further improvements. Evaluation in the MoodSyn dataset demonstrates exceptional fidelity, accurately reproducing both the core statistical patterns and complex relationships present in the original data while maintaining strong utility for machine learning applications. Together, these contributions provide both an advanced diagnostic tool and a critical research resource for computational psychiatry, bridging important gaps in AI-assisted mental health assessment."
2506.03788,"Lockdown measures, implemented by governments during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce physical contact and limit viral spread, imposed significant restrictions on in-person social interactions. Consequently, individuals turned to online social platforms to maintain connections. Ego networks, which model the organization of personal relationships according to human cognitive constraints on managing meaningful interactions, provide a framework for analyzing such dynamics. The disruption of physical contact and the predominant shift of social life online potentially altered the allocation of cognitive resources dedicated to managing these digital relationships. This research aims to investigate the impact of lockdown measures on the characteristics of online ego networks, presumably resulting from this reallocation of cognitive resources. To this end, a large dataset of Twitter users was examined, covering a seven-year period of activity. Analyzing a seven-year Twitter dataset -- including five years pre-pandemic and two years post -- we observe clear, though temporary, changes. During lockdown, ego networks expanded, social circles became more structured, and relationships intensified. Simultaneously, negative interactions increased, and users engaged with a broader range of topics, indicating greater thematic diversity. Once restrictions were lifted, these structural, emotional, and thematic shifts largely reverted to pre-pandemic norms -- suggesting a temporary adaptation to an extraordinary social context."
2506.04271,"Understanding and controlling diffusion processes in complex networks is critical across domains ranging from epidemiology to information science. Here, we present ExDiff, an interactive and modular computational framework that integrates network simulation, graph neural networks (GNNs), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to model and interpret diffusion dynamics. ExDiff combines classical compartmental models with deep learning techniques to capture both the structural and temporal characteristics of diffusion across diverse network topologies. The framework features dedicated modules for network analysis, neural modeling, simulation, and interpretability, all accessible via an intuitive interface built on Google Colab. Through a case study of the Susceptible Infectious Recovered Vaccinated Dead (SIRVD) model, we demonstrate the capacity to simulate disease spread, evaluate intervention strategies, classify node states, and reveal the structural determinants of contagion through XAI techniques. By unifying simulation and interpretability, ExDiff provides a powerful, flexible, and accessible platform for studying diffusion phenomena in networked systems, enabling both methodological innovation and practical insight."
2506.04292,"Purpose: This paper introduces a novel graph-based method, GARG-AML, for efficient and effective anti-money laundering (AML). It quantifies smurfing risk, a popular money laundering method, by providing each node in the network with a single interpretable score. The proposed method strikes a balance among computational efficiency, detection power and transparency. Different versions of GARG-AML are introduced for undirected and directed networks.Methodology: GARG-AML constructs the adjacency matrix of a node's second-order neighbourhood in a specific way. This allows us to use the density of different blocks in the adjacency matrix to express the neighbourhood's resemblance to a pure smurfing pattern. GARG-AML is extended using a decision tree and gradient-boosting classifier to increase its performance even more. The methods are tested on synthetic and on open-source data against the current state-of-the-art in AML.Findings: We find that GARG-AML obtains state-of-the-art performance on all datasets. We illustrate that GARG-AML scales well to massive transactions graphs encountered at financial institutions. By leveraging only the adjacency matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing fraud detection.Originality: This paper uses only basic network features and expert knowledge on smurfing to construct a performant AML system. The originality lies in the translation of smurfing detection to these features and network representation. Our proposed method is built around the real business needs of scalability and interpretability. It therefore provides a solution that can be easily implemented at financial institutions or incorporated in existing AML solutions."
2506.04475,"Effective teamwork is essential in structured, performance-driven environments, from professional organizations to high-stakes competitive settings. As tasks grow more complex, achieving high performance requires not only technical proficiency but also strong interpersonal skills that allow individuals to coordinate effectively within teams. While prior research has identified social skills and familiarity as key drivers of team success, their joint effects -- particularly in temporary teams -- remain underexplored due to data and methodological constraints. To address this gap, we analyze a large-scale panel dataset from the real-time strategy game Age of Empires II, where players are assigned quasi-randomly to temporary teams and must coordinate under dynamic, high-pressure conditions. We isolate individual contributions by comparing observed match outcomes with predictions based on task proficiency. Our findings confirm a robust 'team player effect': certain individuals consistently improve team outcomes beyond what their technical skills predict. This effect is significantly amplified by team familiarity -- teams with prior shared experience benefit more from the presence of such individuals. Moreover, the effect grows with team size, suggesting that social skills become increasingly valuable as coordination demands rise. Our results demonstrate that social skills and familiarity interact in a complementary, rather than additive, way. These findings contribute to the literature on team performance by documenting the strength and structure of the team player effect in a quasi-randomized, high-stakes setting, with implications for teamwork in organizations and labor markets."
2506.05086,"Online social media platforms are often seen as catalysts for radicalization, as they provide spaces where extreme beliefs can take root and spread, sometimes leading to real-world consequences. Conspiracy theories represent a specific form of radicalization that is notoriously resistant to online moderation strategies. One explanation for this resilience is the presence of a ""conspiratorial mindset"", a cognitive framework that fundamentally shapes how conspiracy believers perceive reality. However, the role of this mindset in driving online user behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyze the psycholinguistic patterns of Reddit users who become active in a prominent conspiracy community by examining their activity in mainstream communities, which allows us to isolate linguistic markers for the presence of a conspiratorial mindset. We find that conspiracy-engaged individuals exhibit distinct psycholinguistic fingerprints, setting them apart from the general user population. Crucially, this signal is already evident in their online activity prior to joining the conspiracy community, allowing us to predict their involvement years in advance. These findings suggest that individuals who adopt conspiracy beliefs do not radicalize through community involvement, but possess a pre-existing conspiratorial mindset, which predisposes them to seek out and join extreme communities. By challenging the view that online social media platforms actively radicalize users into conspiracy theory beliefs, our findings suggest that standard moderation strategies have limited impact on curbing radicalization, and highlight the need for more targeted, supportive interventions that encourage disengagement from extremist narratives. Ultimately, this work contributes to fostering safer online and offline environments for public discourse."
2506.05486,"The Artificial Benchmark for Community Detection (ABCD) graph is a random graph model with community structure and power-law distribution for both degrees and community sizes. The model generates graphs similar to the well-known LFR model but it is faster, more interpretable, and can be investigated analytically. In this paper, we use the underlying ingredients of the ABCD model, and its generalization to include outliers (ABCD+$o$), and introduce another variant that allows for overlapping communities, ABCD+$o^2$."
2506.05522,"Community-level blocklists are key to content moderation practices in decentralized social media. These blocklists enable moderators to prevent other communities, such as those acting in bad faith, from interacting with their own -- and, if shared publicly, warn others about communities worth blocking. Prior work has examined blocklists in centralized social media, noting their potential for collective moderation outcomes, but has focused on blocklists as individual-level tools. To understand how moderators perceive and utilize community-level blocklists and what additional support they may need, we examine social media communities running Mastodon, an open-source microblogging software built on the ActivityPub protocol. We conducted (1) content analysis of the community-level blocklist ecosystem, and (2) semi-structured interviews with twelve Mastodon moderators. Our content analysis revealed wide variation in blocklist goals, inclusion criteria, and transparency. Interviews showed moderators balance proactive safety, reactive practices, and caution around false positives when using blocklists for moderation. They noted challenges and limitations in current blocklist use, suggesting design improvements like comment receipts, category filters, and collaborative voting. We discuss implications for decentralized content moderation, highlighting trade-offs between openness, safety, and nuance; the complexity of moderator roles; and opportunities for future design."
2506.05868,"Research on online coordinated behaviour has predominantly focused on text-based social media platforms. However, the rise of video-first platforms such as TikTok introduces distinct challenges. The multimodal nature of video posts, combining visuals, audio, and text, allows for coordination across various modalities and complicates comparison between posts. This paper proposes an approach to detecting coordination that addresses these characteristic challenges. Our methodology, based on multilayer network analysis, is tailored to capture coordination across multiple modalities, and explicitly handles complex forms of similarity inherent in video and audio content. We test this approach on German political posts regarding the 2024 European Elections retrieved via the TikTok Research API. Our results demonstrate the ability of our approach to identify coordination within the constraints of the API, while also critically highlighting potential pitfalls and limitations."
2506.06106,"Online attention is an increasingly valuable resource in the digital age, with extraordinary events such as the COVID-19 pandemic fuelling fierce competition around it. As misinformation pervades online platforms, users seek credible sources, while news outlets compete to attract and retain their attention. Here we measure the co-evolution of online ""engagement"" with (mis)information and its ""visibility"", where engagement corresponds to user interactions on social media, and visibility to fluctuations in user follower counts. Using a scalable temporal network modelling framework applied to over 100 million COVID-related retweets spanning 3 years, we find that highly engaged sources experience sharp spikes in follower growth during major events (e.g., vaccine rollouts, epidemic severity), whereas sources with more questionable credibility tend to sustain faster growth outside of these periods. Our framework lends itself to studying other large-scale events where online attention is at stake, such as climate and political debates."
2506.06153,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly involved in shaping public understanding on contested issues. This has led to substantial discussion about the potential of LLMs to reinforce or correct misperceptions. While existing literature documents the impact of LLMs on individuals' beliefs, limited work explores how LLMs affect social networks. We address this gap with a pre-registered experiment (N = 1265) around the 2024 US presidential election, where we empirically explore the impact of personalized LLMs on belief accuracy in the context of social networks. The LLMs are constructed to be personalized, offering messages tailored to individuals' profiles, and to have guardrails for accurate information retrieval. We find that the presence of a personalized LLM leads individuals to update their beliefs towards the truth. More importantly, individuals with a personalized LLM in their social network not only choose to follow it, indicating they would like to obtain information from it in subsequent interactions, but also construct subsequent social networks to include other individuals with beliefs similar to the LLM -- in this case, more accurate beliefs. Therefore, our results show that LLMs have the capacity to influence individual beliefs and the social networks in which people exist, and highlight the potential of LLMs to act as corrective agents in online environments. Our findings can inform future strategies for responsible AI-mediated communication."
2506.06157,"Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to generalize across domains and tasks. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), a recent study explored the integration of HGNNs with LLMs for generalizable heterogeneous graph learning. However, this approach typically encodes structural information as HG tokens using HGNNs, and disparities in embedding spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension of HGs. Moreover, since these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks, the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent cloze-style 'mask' token prediction paradigm. Specifically,MLM4HG first converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover, the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of MLM4HG over state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Our code is available atthis https URL."
2506.06513,"Network classification plays a crucial role in the study of complex systems, impacting fields like biology, sociology, and computer science. In this research, we present an innovative benchmark dataset made up of synthetic networks that are categorized into various classes and subclasses. This dataset is specifically crafted to test the effectiveness and resilience of different network classification methods. To put these methods to the test, we also introduce various types and levels of structural noise. We evaluate five feature extraction techniques: traditional structural measures, Life-Like Network Automata (LLNA), Graph2Vec, Deterministic Tourist Walk (DTW), and its improved version, the Deterministic Tourist Walk with Bifurcation (DTWB). Our experimental results reveal that DTWB surpasses the other methods in classifying both classes and subclasses, even when faced with significant noise. LLNA and DTW also perform well, while Graph2Vec lands somewhere in the middle in terms of accuracy. Interestingly, topological measures, despite their simplicity and common usage, consistently show the weakest classification performance. These findings underscore the necessity of robust feature extraction techniques for effective network classification, particularly in noisy conditions."
2506.06728,"Dynamic graph learning (DGL) aims to learn informative and temporally-evolving node embeddings to support downstream tasks such as link prediction. A fundamental challenge in DGL lies in effectively modeling both the temporal dynamics and structural dependencies of evolving graph topologies. Recent advances in Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) have obtained remarkable success by leveraging message-passing mechanisms to capture pairwise node interactions. However, these approaches often overlook more complex structural patterns, particularly neighborhood overlap, which can play a critical role in characterizing node interactions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Neighborhood Overlap-Aware High-Order Graph Neural Network (NO-HGNN), which is built upon two key innovations: (a) computing a correlation score based on the extent of neighborhood overlap to better capture complex node interactions; and (b) embedding this correlation directly into the message-passing process of high-order graph neural networks in the DGL. Experiments on two real-world dynamic graphs show that NO-HGNN achieves notable improvements in link prediction accuracy, outperforming several state-of-the-art approaches."
2506.07026,"Centrality represents a fundamental research field in complex network analysis, where centrality measures identify important vertices within networks. Over the years, researchers have developed diverse centrality measures from varied perspectives. This paper proposes an $\alpha$-triangle eigenvector centrality ($\alpha$TEC), which is a global centrality measure based on both edge and triangle structures. It can dynamically adjust the influence of edges and triangles through a parameter $\alpha$ ($\alpha \in (0,1]$). The centrality scores for vertices are defined as the eigenvector corresponding to the spectral radius of a nonnegative tensor. By the Perron-Frobenius theorem, $\alpha$TEC guarantees unique positive centrality scores for all vertices in connected graphs. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world networks demonstrate that $\alpha$TEC effectively identifies the vertex's structural positioning within graphs. As $\alpha$ increases (decreases), the centrality rankings reflect a stronger (weaker) contribution from edge structure and a weaker (stronger) contribution from triangle structure. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that vertices with higher $\alpha$TEC rankings have a greater impact on network connectivity."
2506.07435,"Computing classical centrality measures such as betweenness and closeness is computationally expensive on large-scale graphs. In this work, we introduce an efficient force layout algorithm that embeds a graph into a low-dimensional space, where the radial distance from the origin serves as a proxy for various centrality measures. We evaluate our method on multiple graph families and demonstrate strong correlations with degree, PageRank, and paths-based centralities. As an application, it turns out that the proposed embedding allows to find high-influence nodes in a network, and provides a fast and scalable alternative to the standard greedy algorithm."
2506.09764,"We introduce novel null models for assessing the results obtained from observed binary transactional and sequence datasets, using statistical hypothesis testing. Our null models maintain more properties of the observed dataset than existing ones. Specifically, they preserve the Bipartite Joint Degree Matrix of the bipartite (multi-)graph corresponding to the dataset, which ensures that the number of caterpillars, i.e., paths of length three, is preserved, in addition to other properties considered by other models. We describe Alice, a suite of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for sampling datasets from our null models, based on a carefully defined set of states and efficient operations to move between them. The results of our experimental evaluation show that Alice mixes fast and scales well, and that our null model finds different significant results than ones previously considered in the literature."
2506.09866,"Hypergraph alignment is a well-known NP-hard problem with numerous practical applications across domains such as bioinformatics, social network analysis, and computer vision. Despite its computational complexity, practical and scalable solutions are urgently needed to enable pattern discovery and entity correspondence in high-order relational data. The problem remains understudied in contrast to its graph based counterpart. In this paper, we propose ELRUHNA, an elimination rule-based framework for unsupervised hypergraph alignment that operates on the bipartite representation of hypergraphs. We introduce the incidence alignment formulation, a binary quadratic optimization approach that jointly aligns vertices and hyperedges. ELRUHNA employs a novel similarity propagation scheme using local matching and cooling rules, supported by an initialization strategy based on generalized eigenvector centrality for incidence matrices. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that ELRUHNA achieves higher alignment accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, while scaling effectively to large hypergraphs."
2506.10017,"Intercepting a criminal using limited police resources presents a significant challenge in dynamic crime environments, where the criminal's location continuously changes over time. The complexity is further heightened by the vastness of the transportation network. To tackle this problem, we propose a layered graph representation, in which each time step is associated with a duplicate of the transportation network. For any given set of attacker strategies, a near-optimal defender strategy is computed using the A-Star heuristic algorithm applied to the layered graph. The defender's goal is to maximize the probability of successful interdiction. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method by comparing it with a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach used for the defender. The comparison considers both computational efficiency and solution quality. The results demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses the complexity of the problem and delivers high-quality solutions within a short computation time."
2506.10135,"Networks can have various types of mesoscale structures. One type of mesoscale structure in networks is core-periphery structure, which consists of densely-connected core nodes and sparsely-connected peripheral nodes. The core nodes are connected densely to each other and can be connected to the peripheral nodes, which are connected sparsely to other nodes. There has been much research on core-periphery structure in time-independent networks, but few core-periphery detection methods have been developed for time-dependent (i.e., ``temporal"") networks. Using a multilayer-network representation of temporal networks and an inference approach that employs stochastic block models, we generalize a recent method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure \cite{Polanco23} from time-independent networks to temporal networks. In contrast to ``onion-like'' nested core-periphery structures (where each node is assigned to a group according to how deeply it is nested in a network's core), hierarchical core-periphery structures encompass networks with nested structures, tree-like structures (where any two groups must either be disjoint or have one as a strict subset of the other), and general non-nested mesoscale structures (where the group assignments of nodes do not have to be nested in any way). To perform statistical inference and thereby identify core-periphery structure, we use a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We illustrate our method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure in two real-world temporal networks, and we briefly discuss the structures that we identify in these networks."
2506.11934,"This study investigates the emotional dynamics of Italian soccer fandoms through computational analysis of user-generated content from official Instagram accounts of 83 teams across Serie A, Serie B, and Lega Pro during the 2023-24 season. By applying sentiment analysis to fan comments, we extract temporal emotional patterns and identify distinct clusters of fan bases with similar preseason expectations. Drawing from complex systems theory, we characterize joy as displaying anti-bursty temporal distributions, while anger is marked by pronounced bursty patterns. Our analysis reveals significant correlations between these emotional signals, preseason expectations, socioeconomic factors, and final league rankings. In particular, the burstiness metric emerges as a meaningful correlate of team performance; statistical models excluding this parameter show a decrease in the coefficient of determination of 32%. These findings offer novel insights into the relationship between fan emotional expression and team outcomes, suggesting potential avenues for research in sports analytics, social media dynamics, and fan engagement studies."
2506.1275,"With the development of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) becomes a major trend in the next-generation networks. However, due to the instability of heterogeneous communication and time-varying characteristics of SAGIN, it is challenging to meet the remote Internet of Things (IoT) demands for data collection and offloading. In this paper, we investigate a two-phase hierarchical data uplink model in SAGIN. Specifically, UAVs optimize trajectories to enable efficient data collection from IoT devices, and then they transmit the data to LEO satellites with computing capabilities for further processing. The problem is formulated to minimize the total energy consumption for IoT devices, UAVs, and LEO satellites. Since the problem is in the form of mixed-integer nonlinear programming and intractable to solve directly, we decompose it into two phases. In the IoT-UAV phase, we design the algorithm to jointly optimize the IoT pairing, power allocation, and UAVs trajectories. Considering the high dynamic characteristics of LEO satellites, a real-time LEO satellite selection mechanism joint with the Satellite Tool Kit is proposed in the UAV-LEO phase. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, with about 10% less energy consumption compared with the benchmark algorithm."
2506.12814,"This position paper argues that governments should mandate a three-tier anonymity framework on social-media platforms as a reactionary measure prompted by the ease-of-production of deepfakes and large-language-model-driven misinformation. The tiers are determined by a given user's $\textit{reach score}$: Tier 1 permits full pseudonymity for smaller accounts, preserving everyday privacy; Tier 2 requires private legal-identity linkage for accounts with some influence, reinstating real-world accountability at moderate reach; Tier 3 would require per-post, independent, ML-assisted fact-checking, review for accounts that would traditionally be classed as sources-of-mass-information.An analysis of Reddit shows volunteer moderators converge on comparable gates as audience size increases -- karma thresholds, approval queues, and identity proofs -- demonstrating operational feasibility and social legitimacy. Acknowledging that existing engagement incentives deter voluntary adoption, we outline a regulatory pathway that adapts existing US jurisprudence and recent EU-UK safety statutes to embed reach-proportional identity checks into existing platform tooling, thereby curbing large-scale misinformation while preserving everyday privacy."
2506.12842,"The emergence of online social platforms, such as social networks and social media, has drastically affected the way people apprehend the information flows to which they are exposed. In such platforms, various information cascades spreading among users is the main force creating complex dynamics of opinion formation, each user being characterized by their own behavior adoption mechanism. Moreover, the spread of multiple pieces of information or beliefs in a networked population is rarely uncorrelated. In this paper, we introduce the Mixture of Interacting Cascades (MIC), a model of marked multidimensional Hawkes processes with the capacity to model jointly non-trivial interaction between cascades and users. We emphasize on the interplay between information cascades and user activity, and use a mixture of temporal point processes to build a coupled user/cascade point process model. Experiments on synthetic and real data highlight the benefits of this approach and demonstrate that MIC achieves superior performance to existing methods in modeling the spread of information cascades. Finally, we demonstrate how MIC can provide, through its learned parameters, insightful bi-layered visualizations of real social network activity data."
2506.12988,"The rapid growth of social media presents a unique opportunity to study coordinated agent behavior in an unfiltered environment. Online processes often exhibit complex structures that reflect the nature of the user behavior, whether it is authentic and genuine, or part of a coordinated effort by malicious agents to spread misinformation and disinformation. Detection of AI-generated content can be extremely challenging due to the high quality of large language model-generated text. Therefore, approaches that use metadata like post timings are required to effectively detect coordinated AI-driven campaigns. Existing work that models the spread of information online is limited in its ability to represent different control flows that occur within the network in practice. Process mining offers techniques for the discovery of process models with different routing constructs and are yet to be applied to social networks. We propose to leverage process mining methods for the discovery of AI and human agent behavior within social networks. Applying process mining techniques to real-world Twitter (now X) event data, we demonstrate how the structural and behavioral properties of discovered process models can reveal coordinated AI and human behaviors online."
2506.13319,"In real-world social systems, individual interactions are frequently shaped by reputation, which not only influences partner selection but also affects the nature and benefits of the interactions themselves. We propose a heterogeneous game transition model that incorporates a reputation-based dynamic threshold mechanism to investigate how reputation regulates game evolution. In our framework, individuals determine the type of game they engage in according to their own and their neighbors' reputation levels. In turn, the outcomes of these interactions modify their reputations, thereby driving the adaptation and evolution of future strategies in a feedback-informed manner. Through simulations on two representative topological structures, square lattice and small-world networks, we find that network topology exerts a profound influence on the evolutionary dynamics. Due to its localized connection characteristics, the square lattice network fosters the long-term coexistence of competing strategies. In contrast, the small-world network is more susceptible to changes in system parameters due to the efficiency of information dissemination and the sensitivity of strategy evolution. Additionally, the reputation mechanism is significant in promoting the formation of a dominant state of cooperation, especially in contexts of high sensitivity to reputation. Although the initial distribution of reputation influences the early stage of the evolutionary path, it has little effect on the final steady state of the system. Hence, we can conclude that the ultimate steady state of evolution is primarily determined by the reputation mechanism and the network structure."
2506.13343,"User-level stance detection (UserSD) remains challenging due to the lack of high-quality benchmarks that jointly capture linguistic and social structure. In this paper, we introduce TwiUSD, the first large-scale, manually annotated UserSD benchmark with explicit followee relationships, containing 16,211 users and 47,757 tweets. TwiUSD enables rigorous evaluation of stance models by integrating tweet content and social links, with superior scale and annotation quality. Building on this resource, we propose MRFG: a structure-aware framework that uses LLM-based relevance filtering and feature routing to address noise and context heterogeneity. MRFG employs multi-scale filtering and adaptively routes features through graph neural networks or multi-layer perceptrons based on topological informativeness. Experiments show MRFG consistently outperforms strong baselines (including PLMs, graph-based models, and LLM prompting) in both in-target and cross-target evaluation."
2506.13912,"Coordinated campaigns frequently exploit social media platforms by artificially amplifying topics, making inauthentic trends appear organic, and misleading users into engagement. Distinguishing these coordinated efforts from genuine public discourse remains a significant challenge due to the sophisticated nature of such attacks. Our work focuses on detecting coordinated campaigns by modeling the problem as a graph classification task. We leverage the recently introduced Large Engagement Networks (LEN) dataset, which contains over 300 networks capturing engagement patterns from both fake and authentic trends on Twitter prior to the 2023 Turkish elections. The graphs in LEN were constructed by collecting interactions related to campaigns that stemmed from ephemeral astroturfing. Established graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle to accurately classify campaign graphs, highlighting the challenges posed by LEN due to the large size of its networks. To address this, we introduce a new graph classification method that leverages the density of local network structures. We propose a random weighted walk (RWW) approach in which node transitions are biased by local density measures such as degree, core number, or truss number. These RWWs are encoded using the Skip-gram model, producing density-aware structural embeddings for the nodes. Training message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) on these density-aware embeddings yields superior results compared to the simpler node features available in the dataset, with nearly a 12\% and 5\% improvement in accuracy for binary and multiclass classification, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating density-aware structural encoding with MPNNs provides a robust framework for identifying coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media networks such as Twitter."
2506.13989,"Money laundering enables organized crime by moving illicit funds into the legitimate economy. Although trillions of dollars are laundered each year, detection rates remain low because launderers evade oversight, confirmed cases are rare, and institutions see only fragments of the global transaction network. Since access to real transaction data is tightly restricted, synthetic datasets are essential for developing and evaluating detection methods. However, existing datasets fall short: they often neglect partial observability, temporal dynamics, strategic behavior, uncertain labels, class imbalance, and network-level dependencies. We introduce AMLGentex, an open-source suite for generating realistic, configurable transaction data and benchmarking detection methods. AMLGentex enables systematic evaluation of anti-money laundering systems under conditions that mirror real-world challenges. By releasing multiple country-specific datasets and practical parameter guidance, we aim to empower researchers and practitioners and provide a common foundation for collaboration and progress in combating money laundering."
2506.13997,"Gerrymandering is one of the biggest threats to American democracy. By manipulating district lines, politicians effectively choose their voters rather than the other way around. Current gerrymandering identification methods (namely the Polsby-Popper and Reock scores) focus on the compactness of congressional districts, making them extremely sensitive to physical geography. To address this gap, we extend Feng and Porter's 2021 paper, which used the level-set method to turn geographic shapefiles into filtered simplicial complexes, in order to compare precinct level voting data to district level voting data. As precincts are regarded as too small to be gerrymandered, we are able to identify discrepancies between precinct and district level voting data to quantify gerrymandering in the United States. By comparing the persistent homologies of Democratic voting regions at the precinct and district levels, we detect when areas have been ""cracked"" (split across multiple districts) or ""packed"" (compressed into one district) for partisan gain. This analysis was conducted for North Carolina House of Representatives elections (2012-2024). North Carolina has been redistricted four times in the past ten years, unusually frequent as most states redistrict decennially, making it a valuable case study. By comparing persistence barcodes at the precinct and district levels (using the bottleneck distance), we show that precinct level voting patterns do not significantly fluctuate biannually, while district level patterns do, suggesting that shifts are likely a result of redistricting rather than voter behavior, providing strong evidence of gerrymandering. This research presents a novel application of topological data analysis in evaluating gerrymandering and shows persistent homology can be useful in discerning gerrymandered districts."
2506.14826,"With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of users are joining group activities on online social platforms. This elicits the requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples during cross-level interests alignment. The results of experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CI4GI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models."
2506.14836,"How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse? This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during crises, protests, and information shocks."
2506.15168,"Social platforms increasingly transition from expert fact-checking to crowd-sourced moderation, with X pioneering this shift through its Community Notes system, enabling users to collaboratively moderate misleading content. To resolve conflicting moderation, Community Notes learns a latent ideological dimension and selects notes garnering cross-partisan support. As this system, designed for and evaluated in the United States, is now deployed worldwide, we evaluate its operation across diverse polarization contexts. We analyze 1.9 million moderation notes with 135 million ratings from 1.2 million users, cross-referencing ideological scaling data across 13 countries. Our results show X's Community Notes effectively captures each country's main polarizing dimension but fails by design to moderate the most polarizing content, posing potential risks to civic discourse and electoral processes."
2506.15866,"The rise of social media has fundamentally transformed how people engage in public discourse and form opinions. While these platforms offer unprecedented opportunities for democratic engagement, they have been implicated in increasing social polarization and the formation of ideological echo chambers. Previous research has primarily relied on observational studies of social media data or theoretical modeling approaches, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of how individuals respond to and are influenced by polarized online environments. Here we present a novel experimental framework for investigating polarization dynamics that allows human users to interact with LLM-based artificial agents in a controlled social network simulation. Through a user study with 122 participants, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully reproduce key characteristics of polarized online discourse while enabling precise manipulation of environmental factors. Our results provide empirical validation of theoretical predictions about online polarization, showing that polarized environments significantly increase perceived emotionality and group identity salience while reducing expressed uncertainty. These findings extend previous observational and theoretical work by providing causal evidence for how specific features of online environments influence user perceptions and behaviors. More broadly, this research introduces a powerful new methodology for studying social media dynamics, offering researchers unprecedented control over experimental conditions while maintaining ecological validity."
2506.16302,"Online social networks (OSNs) have transformed the way individuals fulfill their social needs and consume information. As OSNs become increasingly prominent sources for news dissemination, individuals often encounter content that influences their opinions through both direct interactions and broader network dynamics. In this paper, we propose the Friedkin-Johnsen on Cascade (FJC) model, which is, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to integrate information cascades and opinion dynamics, specifically using the very popular Friedkin-Johnsen model. Our model, validated over real social cascades, highlights how the convergence of socialization and sharing news on these platforms can disrupt opinion evolution dynamics typically observed in offline settings. Our findings demonstrate that these cascades can amplify the influence of central opinion leaders, making them more resistant to divergent viewpoints, even when challenged by a critical mass of dissenting opinions. This research underscores the importance of understanding the interplay between social dynamics and information flow in shaping public discourse in the digital age."
2506.16412,"Generative AI (GAI) technologies are quickly reshaping the educational landscape. As adoption accelerates, understanding how students and educators perceive these tools is essential. This study presents one of the most comprehensive analyses to date of stakeholder discourse dynamics on GAI in education using social media data. Our dataset includes 1,199 Reddit posts and 13,959 corresponding top-level comments. We apply sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and author classification. To support this, we propose and validate a modular framework that leverages prompt-based large language models (LLMs) for analysis of online social discourse, and we evaluate this framework against classical natural language processing (NLP) models. Our GPT-4o pipeline consistently outperforms prior approaches across all tasks. For example, it achieved 90.6% accuracy in sentiment analysis against gold-standard human annotations. Topic extraction uncovered 12 latent topics in the public discourse with varying sentiment and author distributions. Teachers and students convey optimism about GAI's potential for personalized learning and productivity in higher education. However, key differences emerged: students often voice distress over false accusations of cheating by AI detectors, while teachers generally express concern about job security, academic integrity, and institutional pressures to adopt GAI tools. These contrasting perspectives highlight the tension between innovation and oversight in GAI-enabled learning environments. Our findings suggest a need for clearer institutional policies, more transparent GAI integration practices, and support mechanisms for both educators and students. More broadly, this study demonstrates the potential of LLM-based frameworks for modeling stakeholder discourse within online communities."
2506.16449,"During the 2022 French presidential election, we collected daily Twitter messages on key topics posted by political candidates and their close networks. Using a data-driven approach, we analyze interactions among political parties, identifying central topics that shape the landscape of political debate. Moving beyond traditional correlation analyses, we apply a causal inference technique: Convergent Cross Mapping, to uncover directional influences among political communities, revealing how some parties are more likely to initiate changes in activity while others tend to respond. This approach allows us to distinguish true influence from mere correlation, highlighting asymmetric relationships and hidden dynamics within the social media political network. Our findings demonstrate how specific issues, such as health and foreign policy, act as catalysts for cross-party influence, particularly during critical election phases. These insights provide a novel framework for understanding political discourse dynamics and have practical implications for campaign strategists and media analysts seeking to monitor and respond to shifts in political influence in real time."
2506.16618,"Living in the Post API age, researchers face unprecedented challenges in obtaining social media data, while users are concerned about how big tech companies use their data. Data donation offers a promising alternative, however, its scalability is limited by low participation and high dropout rates. Research suggests that data marketplaces could be a solution, but its realization remains challenging due to theoretical gaps in treating data as an asset. This paper examines whether data marketplaces can increase individuals willingness to sell their X (Twitter) data package and the minimum price they would accept. It also explores how privacy protections and the type of data buyer may affect these decisions. Results from two preregistered online survey experiments show that a data marketplace increases participants' willingness to sell their X data by 12 to 25 percentage points compared to data donation (depending on treatments), and by 6.8 points compared to onetime purchase offers. Although difference in minimum acceptable prices are not statistically significant, over 64 percentage of participants set their price within the marketplace's suggested range (0.25 to 2), substantially lower than the amounts offered in prior onetime purchase studies. Finally, in the marketplace setting, neither the type of buyer nor the inclusion of a privacy safeguard significantly influenced participants willingness to sell."
2506.17312,"Graph representation learning (GRL) has emerged as an effective technique for modeling graph-structured data. When modeling heterogeneity and dynamics in real-world complex networks, GRL methods designed for complex heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) have been proposed and have achieved successful applications in various fields. However, most existing GRL methods mainly focus on preserving the low-order topology information while ignoring higher-order group interaction relationships, which are more consistent with real-world networks. In addition, most existing hypergraph methods can only model static homogeneous graphs, limiting their ability to model high-order interactions in HTGs. Therefore, to simultaneously enable the GRL model to capture high-order interaction relationships in HTGs, we first propose a formal definition of heterogeneous temporal hypergraphs and $P$-uniform heterogeneous hyperedge construction algorithm that does not rely on additional information. Then, a novel Heterogeneous Temporal HyperGraph Neural network (HTHGN), is proposed to fully capture higher-order interactions in HTGs. HTHGN contains a hierarchical attention mechanism module that simultaneously performs temporal message-passing between heterogeneous nodes and hyperedges to capture rich semantics in a wider receptive field brought by hyperedges. Furthermore, HTHGN performs contrastive learning by maximizing the consistency between low-order correlated heterogeneous node pairs on HTG to avoid the low-order structural ambiguity issue. Detailed experimental results on three real-world HTG datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed HTHGN for modeling high-order interactions in HTGs and demonstrate significant performance improvements."
2506.17316,"This paper proposes a family of graph metrics for measuring distances between graphs of different sizes. The proposed metric family defines a general form of the graph generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and is also proved to satisfy the metric properties. Similarly to the graph GOSPA metric, the proposed graph GOSPA metric family also penalises the node attribute costs for assigned nodes between the two graphs, and the number of unassigned nodes. However, the proposed family of metrics provides more general penalties for edge mismatches than the graph GOSPA metric. This paper also shows that the graph GOSPA metric family can be approximately computed using linear programming. Simulation experiments are performed to illustrate the characteristics of the proposed graph GOSPA metric family with different choices of hyperparameters. The benefits of the proposed graph GOSPA metric family for classification tasks are also shown on real-world datasets."
2506.1764,"Unsupervised plain graph alignment (UPGA) aims to align corresponding nodes across two graphs without any auxiliary information. Existing UPGA methods rely on structural consistency while neglecting the inherent structural differences in real-world graphs, leading to biased node representations. Moreover, their one-shot alignment strategies lack mechanisms to correct erroneous matches arising from inaccurate anchor seeds. To address these issues, this paper proposes IterAlign, a novel parameter-free and efficient UPGA method. First, a simple yet powerful representation generation method based on heat diffusion is introduced to capture multi-level structural characteristics, mitigating the over-reliance on structural consistency and generating stable node representations. Two complementary node alignment strategies are then adopted to balance alignment accuracy and efficiency across graphs of varying scales. By alternating between representation generation and node alignment, IterAlign iteratively rectifies biases in nodes representations and refines the alignment process, leading to superior and robust alignment performance. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed IterAlign outperforms state-of-the-art UPGA approaches with a lower computational overhead, but also showcases the ability to approach the theoretical accuracy upper bound of unsupervised plain graph alignment task."
2506.17925,"Complex networks serve as abstract models for understanding real-world complex systems and provide frameworks for studying structured dynamical systems. This article addresses limitations in current studies on the exploration of individual birth-death and the development of community structures within dynamic systems. To bridge this gap, we propose a networked evolution model that includes the birth and death of individuals, incorporating reinforcement learning through games among individuals. Each individual has a lifespan following an arbitrary distribution, engages in games with network neighbors, selects actions using Q-learning in reinforcement learning, and moves within a two-dimensional space. The developed theories are validated through extensive experiments. Besides, we observe the evolution of cooperative behaviors and community structures in systems both with and without the birth-death process. The fitting of real-world populations and networks demonstrates the practicality of our model. Furthermore, comprehensive analyses of the model reveal that exploitation rates and payoff parameters determine the emergence of communities, learning rates affect the speed of community formation, discount factors influence stability, and two-dimensional space dimensions dictate community size. Our model offers a novel perspective on real-world community development and provides a valuable framework for studying population dynamics behaviors."
2506.18052,"The proliferation of false information in the digital age has become a pressing concern, necessitating the development of effective and robust detection methods. This paper offers a comprehensive review of existing false information detection techniques, approached from a novel perspective that emphasizes the propagation characteristics of misinformation. We introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes these methods into homogeneous and heterogeneous propagation-based approaches, providing a deeper understanding of the varying scopes and complexities involved in information dissemination. For each category, we present a formal problem formulation, review commonly used datasets, and summarize state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we identify several promising directions for future research, including the creation of a unified benchmark suite, exploration of diverse information modalities, and development of innovative rumor debunking tasks. By systematically organizing the vast array of current techniques, this work offers a clear overview of the research landscape, aiding researchers and practitioners in navigating this complex field and inspiring further advancements."
2506.18641,"Effectively preserving both the structural and dynamical properties during the reduction of complex networks remains a significant research topic. Existing network reduction methods based on renormalization group or sampling often face challenges such as high computational complexity and the loss of critical dynamic attributes. This paper proposes an efficient network reduction framework based on subgraph extraction, which accurately preserves epidemic spreading dynamics and information flow through a coordinated optimization strategy of node removal and edge pruning. Specifically, a node removal algorithm driven by enhanced degree centrality is introduced to preferentially remove low-centrality nodes, thereby constructing a smaller-scale subnetwork. Subsequently, an edge pruning algorithm is designed to regulate the edge density of the subnetwork, ensuring that its average degree remains approximately consistent with that of the original network. Experimental results on Erdös-Rényi random graphs, Barabási-Albert scale-free networks, and real-world social contact networks from various domains demonstrate that this proposed method can reduce the size of networks with heterogeneous structures by more than 85\%, while preserving their epidemic dynamics and information flow. More importantly, our method almost always achieves the highest accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques. These findings provide valuable insights for predicting the dynamical behavior of large-scale real-world networks, and also reveal that a large number of nodes and edges in real-world networks play redundant roles in information transmission."
2506.18845,"SocioXplorer is a powerful interactive tool that computational social science researchers can use to understand topics and networks in social data from Twitter (X) and YouTube. It integrates, among other things, artificial intelligence, natural language processing and social network analysis. It can be used with ``live"" datasets that receive regular updates. SocioXplorer is an extension of a previous system called TwiXplorer, which was limited to the analysis of archival Twitter (X) data. SocioXplorer builds on this by adding the ability to analyse YouTube data, greater depth of analysis and batch data processing. We release it under the Apache 2 licence."
2506.19142,"Network cascade refers to diffusion processes in which outcome changes within part of an interconnected population trigger a sequence of changes across the entire network. These cascades are governed by underlying diffusion networks, which are often latent. Inferring such networks is critical for understanding cascade pathways, uncovering Granger causality of interaction mechanisms among individuals, and enabling tasks such as forecasting or maximizing information propagation. In this project, we propose a novel double mixture directed graph model for inferring multi-layer diffusion networks from cascade data. The proposed model represents cascade pathways as a mixture of diffusion networks across different layers, effectively capturing the strong heterogeneity present in real-world cascades. Additionally, the model imposes layer-specific structural constraints, enabling diffusion networks at different layers to capture complementary cascading patterns at the population level. A key advantage of our model is its convex formulation, which allows us to establish both statistical and computational guarantees for the resulting diffusion network estimates. We conduct extensive simulation studies to demonstrate the model's performance in recovering diverse diffusion structures. Finally, we apply the proposed method to analyze cascades of research topics in the social sciences across U.S. universities, revealing the underlying diffusion networks of research topic propagation among institutions."
2506.19412,"The global energy transition towards distributed, smaller-scale resources, such as decentralized generation and flexible assets like storage and shiftable loads, demands novel control structures aligned with the emerging network architectures. These architectures consist of interconnected, self-contained clusters, commonly called microgrids or energy communities. These clusters aim to optimize collective self-sufficiency by prioritizing local energy use or operating independently during wide-area blackouts. This study addresses the challenge of defining optimal clusters, framed as a community detection problem. A novel metric, termed energy modularity, is proposed to evaluate community partitions by quantifying energy self-sufficiency within clusters while incorporating the influence of flexible resources. Furthermore, a highly scalable community detection algorithm to maximize energy modularity based on the Louvain method is presented. Therefore, energy modularity is calculated using linear programming or a more efficient simulation-based approach. The algorithm is validated on an exemplary benchmark grid, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying optimal energy clusters for modern decentralized energy systems."
2506.19485,"A common model for social networks are Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs), in which vertices draw a random position in some latent geometric space, and the probability of two vertices forming an edge depends on their geometric distance. The geometry may be modelled in two ways: either two points are defined as close if they are similar in all dimensions, or they are defined as close if they are similar in some dimensions. The first option is mathematically more natural since it can be described by metrics. However, the second option is arguably the better model for social networks if the different dimensions represent features like profession, kinship, or interests. In such cases, nodes already form bonds if they align in some, but not all dimensions. For the first option, it is known that the resulting networks are poor expanders. We study the second option in the form of Minimum-Component Distance GIRGs, and find that those behave the opposite way for dimension $d\ge 2$, and that they have strong expanding properties. More precisely, for a suitable constant $C>0$, the subgraph induced by vertices of (expected) degree at least $(\log n)^C$ forms an expander. Moreover, we study how the expansion factor of the resulting subgraph depends on the choice of $C$, and show that this expansion factor is $\omega(1)$ except for sets that already take up a constant fraction of the vertices. This has far-reaching consequences, since many algorithms and mixing processes are fast on expander graphs."
2506.1967,"Centrality indices are used to rank the nodes of a graph by importance: this is a common need in many concrete situations (social networks, citation networks, web graphs, for instance) and it was discussed many times in sociology, psychology, mathematics and computer science, giving rise to a whole zoo of definitions of centrality. Although they differ widely in nature, many centrality measures are based on shortest-path distances: such centralities are often referred to as geometric. Geometric centralities can use the shortest-path-length information in many different ways, but most of the existing geometric centralities can be defined as a linear transformation of the distance-count vector (that is, the vector containing, for every index t, the number of nodes at distance t).In this paper we study this class of centralities, that we call linear (geometric) centralities, in their full generality. In particular, we look at them in the light of the axiomatic approach, and we study their expressivity: we show to what extent linear centralities can be used to distinguish between nodes in a graph, and how many different rankings of nodes can be induced by linear centralities on a given graph. The latter problem (which has a number of possible applications, especially in an adversarial setting) is solved by means of a linear programming formulation, which is based on Farkas' lemma, and is interesting in its own right."
2506.20503,"Online Social Networks (OSNs) are a cornerstone in modern society, serving as platforms for diverse content consumption by millions of users each day. However, the challenge of ensuring the accuracy of information shared on these platforms remains significant, especially with the widespread dissemination of disinformation. Social bots -- automated accounts designed to mimic human behavior, frequently spreading misinformation -- represent one of the critical problems of OSNs. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has further complicated bot behaviors, making detection increasingly difficult. This paper presents BotHash, an innovative, training-free approach to social bot detection. BotHash leverages a simplified user representation that enables approximate nearest-neighbor search to detect bots, avoiding the complexities of Deep-Learning model training and large dataset creation. We demonstrate that BotHash effectively differentiates between human and bot accounts, even when state-of-the-art LLMs are employed to generate posts' content. BotHash offers several advantages over existing methods, including its independence from a training phase, robust performance with minimal ground-truth data, and early detection capabilities, showing promising results across various datasets."
2506.20679,"Smartphone location data have transformed urban mobility research, providing unprecedented insights into how people navigate and interact in cities. However, leveraging location data at scale presents methodological challenges. Accurately identifying individuals' home and work locations is critical for a range of applications, including commuting analysis, unemployment estimation, and urban accessibility studies. Despite their widespread use, home-work detection methods lack a standardized framework that accounts for differing data quality and that is validated against ground-truth observations. This limits the comparability and reproducibility of results across studies and datasets. In this paper, we present HoWDe, a robust algorithm for identifying home and work locations from mobility data, explicitly designed to handle missing data and varying data quality across individuals. Using two unique ground-truth datasets comprising over 5100 individuals from more than 80 countries, HoWDe achieves home and work detection accuracies of up to 97% and 88%, respectively, with consistent performance across countries and demographic groups. We examine how parameter choices shape the trade-off between accuracy and user retention, and demonstrate how these methodological decisions influence downstream applications such as employment estimation and commuting pattern analysis. By supporting in-house pre-processing through a transparent and validated pipeline, HoWDe also facilitates the sharing of privacy-preserving mobility data. Together, our tools and findings establish methodological standards that support more robust, scalable, and reproducible mobility research at both individual and urban scales."
2506.20695,"With its features of remix, TikTok is the designated platform for meme-making and dissemination. Creative combinations of video, emoji, and filters allow for an endless stream of memes and trends animated by sound. The platform has focused its moderation on upholding physical safety, hence investing in the detection of harmful challenges. In response to the DSA, TikTok implemented opt-outs for personalized feeds and features allowing users to report illegal content. At the same time, the platform remains subject to scrutiny. Centering on the role of sound and its intersections with ambiguous memes, the presented research probed right-wing extremist formations relating to the 2024 German state elections. The analysis evidences how the TikTok sound infrastructure affords a sustained presence of xenophobic content, often cloaked through vernacular modes of communication. These cloaking practices benefit from a sound infrastructure that affords the ongoing posting of user-generated sounds that instantly spread through the use-this-sound button. Importantly, these sounds are often not clearly recognizable as networkers of extremist content. Songs that do contain hateful lyrics are not eligible for personalized feeds, however, they remain online where they profit from intersecting with benign meme trends, rendering them visible in search results."
2506.20971,"In this study, we analyze 2,398 research articles published between 2020 and 2024 across eight core venues related to the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED). Using a three-step knowledge co-occurrence network analysis, we analyze the knowledge structure of the field, the evolving knowledge clusters, and the emerging frontiers. Our findings reveal that AIED research remains strongly technically focused, with sustained themes such as intelligent tutoring systems, learning analytics, and natural language processing, alongside rising interest in large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). By tracking the bridging keywords over the past five years, we identify four emerging frontiers in AIED--LLMs, GenAI, multimodal learning analytics, and human-AI collaboration. The current research interests in GenAI are centered around GAI-driven personalization, self-regulated learning, feedback, assessment, motivation, andthis http URLkey research interests and emerging frontiers in AIED reflect a growing emphasis on co-adaptive, human-centered AI for education. This study provides the first large-scale field-level mapping of AIED's transformation in the GenAI era and sheds light on the future research development and educational practices."
2506.2098,"Real-world networks usually have a property of node heterophily, that is, the connected nodes usually have different features or different labels. This heterophily issue has been extensively studied in homogeneous graphs but remains under-explored in heterogeneous graphs, where there are multiple types of nodes and edges. Capturing node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs is very challenging since both node/edge heterogeneity and node heterophily should be carefully taken into consideration. Existing methods typically convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones to learn node heterophily, which will inevitably lose the potential heterophily conveyed by heterogeneous relations. To bridge this gap, we propose Relation-Aware Separation of Homophily and Heterophily (RASH), a novel contrastive learning framework that explicitly models high-order semantics of heterogeneous interactions and adaptively separates homophilic and heterophilic patterns. Particularly, RASH introduces dual heterogeneous hypergraphs to encode multi-relational bipartite subgraphs and dynamically constructs homophilic graphs and heterophilic graphs based on relation importance. A multi-relation contrastive loss is designed to align heterogeneous and homophilic/heterophilic views by maximizing mutual information. In this way, RASH simultaneously resolves the challenges of heterogeneity and heterophily in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RASH across various downstream tasks. The code is available at:this https URL."
2506.22103,"From disparities in the number of exhibiting artists to auction opportunities, there is evidence of women's under-representation in visual art. Here we explore the exhibition history and auction sales of 65,768 contemporary artists in 20,389 institutions, revealing gender differences in the artist population, exhibitions and auctions. We distinguish between two criteria for gender equity: gender-neutrality, when artists have gender-independent access to exhibition opportunities, and gender-balanced, that strives for gender parity in representation, finding that 58\% of institutions are gender-neutral but only 24\% are gender-balanced, and that the fraction of man-overrepresented institutions increases with institutional prestige. We define artist's co-exhibition gender to capture the gender inequality of the institutions that an artist exhibits. Finally, we use logistic regression to predict an artist's access to the auction market, finding that co-exhibition gender has a stronger correlation with success than the artist's gender. These results help unveil and quantify the institutional forces that relate to the persistent gender imbalance in the art world."
2506.22165,"Legal systems heavily rely on cross-citations of legal norms as well as previous court decisions. Practitioners, novices and legal AI systems need access to these relevant data to inform appraisals and judgments. We propose a Graph-Neural-Network (GNN) link prediction model that can identify Case-Law and Case-Case citations with high proficiency through fusion of semantic and topological information. We introduce adapted relational graph convolutions operating on an extended and enriched version of the original citation graph that allow the topological integration of semantic meta-information. This further improves prediction by 3.1 points of average precision and by 8.5 points in data sparsity as well as showing robust performance over time and in challenging fully inductive prediction. Jointly learning and predicting case and norm citations achieves a large synergistic effect that improves case citation prediction by up to 4.7 points, at almost doubled efficiency."
2506.22224,"We present a large-scale, longitudinal dataset capturing user activity on the online platform of DerStandard, a major Austrian newspaper. The dataset spans ten years (2013-2022) and includes over 75 million user comments, more than 400 million votes, and detailed metadata on articles and user interactions. It provides structured conversation threads, explicit up- and downvotes of user comments and editorial topic labels, enabling rich analyses of online discourse while preserving user privacy. To ensure this privacy, all persistent identifiers are anonymized using salted hash functions, and the raw comment texts are not publicly shared.

The dataset supports research on discussion dynamics, network structures, and semantic analyses in the mid-resourced language German, offering a reusable resource across computational social science and related fields."
2506.22293,"Online social networks exert a powerful influence on public opinion. Adversaries weaponize these networks to manipulate discourse, underscoring the need for more resilient social networks. To this end, we investigate the impact of network connectivity on Stackelberg equilibria in a two-player game to shape public opinion. We model opinion evolution as a repeated competitive influence-propagation process. Players iteratively inject \textit{messages} that diffuse until reaching a steady state, modeling the dispersion of two competing messages. Opinions then update according to the discounted sum of exposure to the messages. This bi-level model captures viral-media correlation effects omitted by standard opinion-dynamics models. To solve the resulting high-dimensional game, we propose a scalable, iterative algorithm based on linear-quadratic regulators that approximates local feedback Stackelberg strategies for players with limited cognition. We analyze how the network topology shapes equilibrium outcomes through experiments on synthetic networks and real Facebook data. Our results identify structural characteristics that improve a network's resilience to adversarial influence, guiding the design of more resilient social networks."
2506.22946,"Mathematical researchers, especially those in early-career positions, face critical decisions about topic specialization with limited information about the collaborative environments of different research areas. The aim of this paper is to study how the popularity of a research topic is associated with the structure of that topic's collaboration network, as observed by a suite of measures capturing organizational structure at several scales. We apply these measures to 1,938 algorithmically discovered topics across 121,391 papers sourced from arXiv metadata during the period 2020--2025. Our analysis, which controls for the confounding effects of network size, reveals a structural dichotomy--we find that popular topics organize into modular ""schools of thought,"" while niche topics maintain hierarchical core-periphery structures centered around established experts. This divide is not an artifact of scale, but represents a size-independent structural pattern correlated with popularity. We also document a ""constraint reversal"": after controlling for size, researchers in popular fields face greater structural constraints on collaboration opportunities, contrary to conventional expectations. Our findings suggest that topic selection is an implicit choice between two fundamentally different collaborative environments, each with distinct implications for a researcher's career. To make these structural patterns transparent to the research community, we developed the Math Research Compass (this https URL), an interactive platform providing data on topic popularity and collaboration patterns across mathematical topics."
2506.22954,"Context: Due to the demand for strong algorithmic reasoning, complex logic implementation, and strict adherence to input/output formats and resource constraints, competitive programming generation by large language models (LLMs) is considered the most challenging problem in current LLM-based code generation. However, previous studies often evaluate LLMs using simple prompts and benchmark datasets prone to data leakage. Moreover, prior work has limited consideration of the diversity in algorithm types and difficulty levels. Objective: In this study, we aim to evaluate and improve LLMs in solving real-world competitive programming problems. Methods: We initially collect 117 problems from nine regional ICPC/CCPC contests held in 2024 and design four filtering criteria to construct a curated benchmark consisting of 80 problems. Leveraging DeepSeek-R1 as the LLM, we evaluate its competitive program generation capabilities through the online judge (OJ) platforms, guided by a carefully designed basic prompt. For incorrect submissions, we construct a fine-grained error taxonomy and then propose a targeted improvement framework by combining a multi-turn dialogue-based repair phase and an information-augmented regeneration phase. Results: Experimental results show that only 5 out of 80 problems are fully accepted when using basic prompts. For the unsolved problems, we construct the error taxonomy, including general errors (such as design, boundary, condition, data type, syntax, and input/output errors) and specialized errors (such as those in mathematical problems, greedy algorithms, and graph theories). After applying our proposed improvement strategies, we substantially increased the number of correct solutions, with 46 out of 80 problems successfully accepted."
2506.22993,"Social contexts -- such as families, schools, and neighborhoods -- shape life outcomes. The key question is not simply whether they matter, but rather for whom and under what conditions. Here, we argue that prediction gaps -- differences in predictive performance between statistical models of varying complexity -- offer a pathway for identifying surprising empirical patterns (i.e., not captured by simpler models) which highlight where theories succeed or fall short. Using population-scale administrative data from the Netherlands, we compare logistic regression, gradient boosting, and graph neural networks to predict university completion using early-life social contexts. Overall, prediction gaps are small, suggesting that previously identified indicators, particularly parental status, capture most measurable variation in educational attainment. However, gaps are larger for girls growing up without fathers -- suggesting that the effects of social context for these groups go beyond simple models in line with sociological theory. Our paper shows the potential of prediction methods to support sociological explanation."
2506.23179,"Nowadays, people in the modern world communicate with their friends, relatives, and colleagues through the internet. Persons/nodes and communication/edges among them form a network. Social media networks are a type of network where people share their views with the community. There are several models that capture human behavior, such as a reaction to the information received from friends or relatives. The two fundamental models of information diffusion widely discussed in the social networks are the Independent Cascade Model and the Linear Threshold Model. Liu et al. [1] propose a variant of the linear threshold model in their paper title User-driven competitive influence Maximization(UDCIM) in social networks. Authors try to simulate human behavior where they do not make a decision immediately after being influenced, but take a pause for a while, and then they make a final decision. They propose the heuristic algorithms and prove the approximation factor under community constraints( The seed vertices belong to an identical community). Even finding the community is itself an NP-hard problem. In this article, we extend the existing work with algorithms and LP-formation of the problem. We also implement and test the LP-formulated equations on small datasets by using the Gurobi Solver [2]. We furthermore propose one heuristic and one genetic algorithm. The extensive experimentation is carried out on medium to large datasets, and the outcomes of both algorithms are plotted in the results and discussion section."
2507.00422,"The evolution of cooperation in networked systems helps to understand the dynamics in social networks, multi-agent systems, and biological species. The self-persistence of individual strategies is common in real-world decision making. The self-replacement of strategies in evolutionary dynamics forms a selection amplifier, allows an agent to insist on its autologous strategy, and helps the networked system to avoid full defection. In this paper, we study the self-interaction learning in the networked evolutionary dynamics. We propose a self-interaction landscape to capture the strength of an agent's self-loop to reproduce the strategy based on local topology. We find that proper self-interaction can reduce the condition for cooperation and help cooperators to prevail in the system. For a system that favors the evolution of spite, the self-interaction can save cooperative agents from being harmed. Our results on random networks further suggest that an appropriate self-interaction landscape can significantly reduce the critical condition for advantageous mutants, especially for large-degree networks."
2507.006,"Understanding the functional roles of financial institutions within interconnected markets is critical for effective supervision, systemic risk assessment, and resolution planning. We propose an interpretable role-based clustering approach for multi-layer financial networks, designed to identify the functional positions of institutions across different market segments. Our method follows a general clustering framework defined by proximity measures, cluster evaluation criteria, and algorithm selection. We construct explainable node embeddings based on egonet features that capture both direct and indirect trading relationships within and across market layers. Using transaction-level data from the ECB's Money Market Statistical Reporting (MMSR), we demonstrate how the approach uncovers heterogeneous institutional roles such as market intermediaries, cross-segment connectors, and peripheral lenders or borrowers. The results highlight the flexibility and practical value of role-based clustering in analyzing financial networks and understanding institutional behavior in complex market structures."
2507.00619,"This paper investigates International Research Collaboration (IRC) among European Union (EU) countries from 2011 to 2022, with emphasis on gender-based authorship patterns. Drawing from the Web of Science Social Science Citation Index (WoS-SSCI) database, a large dataset of IRC articles was constructed, annotated with categories of authorship based on gender, author affiliation, and COVID-19 subject as topic. Using network science, the study maps collaboration structures and reveals gendered differences in co-authorship networks. Results highlight a substantial rise in IRC over the decade, particularly with the USA and China as key non-EU partners. Articles with at least one female author were consistently less frequent than those with at least one male author. Notably, female-exclusive collaborations showed distinctive network topologies, with more centralized (star-like) patterns and shorter tree diameters. The COVID-19 pandemic further reshaped collaboration dynamics, temporarily reducing the gender gap in IRC but also revealing vulnerabilities in female-dominated research networks. These findings underscore both progress and persistent disparities in the gender dynamics of EU participation in IRC."
2507.01978,"Social media broadly refers to digital platforms and applications that simulate social interactions online. This study investigates the impact of social media platforms and their algorithms on political interest among users. As social media usage continues to rise, platforms like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) play increasingly pivotal roles in shaping political discourse. By employing statistical analyses on data collected from over 3,300 participants, this research identifies significant differences in how various social media platforms influence political interest. Findings reveal that moderate Facebook users demonstrate decreased political engagement, whereas even minimal engagement with X significantly boosts political interest. The study further identifies demographic variations, noting that males, older individuals, Black or African American users, those with higher incomes show greater political interest. The demographic analysis highlights that Republicans are particularly active on social media - potentially influencing their social media engagement patterns. However, the study acknowledges a crucial limitation - the lack of direct data regarding the content users are exposed to which is shaping their social media experiences. Future research should explore these influences and consider additional popular platforms to enhance the understanding of social media's political impact. Addressing these gaps can provide deeper insights into digital political mobilization, aiding policymakers, educators, and platform designers in fostering healthier democratic engagement."
2507.02166,"Graph generation is an important area in network science. Traditional approaches focus on replicating specific properties of real-world graphs, such as small diameters or power-law degree distributions. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly with Graph Neural Networks, have enabled data-driven methods to learn and generate graphs without relying on predefined structural properties. Despite these advances, current models are limited by their reliance on node IDs, which restricts their ability to generate graphs larger than the input graph and ignores node attributes. To address these challenges, we propose Latent Graph Sampling Generation (LGSG), a novel framework that leverages diffusion models and node embeddings to generate graphs of varying sizes without retraining. The framework eliminates the dependency on node IDs and captures the distribution of node embeddings and subgraph structures, enabling scalable and flexible graph generation. Experimental results show that LGSG performs on par with baseline models for standard metrics while outperforming them in overlooked ones, such as the tendency of nodes to form clusters. Additionally, it maintains consistent structural characteristics across graphs of different sizes, demonstrating robustness and scalability."
2507.03448,"This paper presents a data-driven mean-field approach to model the popularity dynamics of users seeking public attention, i.e., influencers. We propose a novel analytical model that integrates individual activity patterns, expertise in producing viral content, exogenous events, and the platform's role in visibility enhancement, ultimately determining each influencer's success. We analytically derive sufficient conditions for system ergodicity, enabling predictions of popularity distributions. A sensitivity analysis explores various system configurations, highlighting conditions favoring either dominance or fair play among influencers. Our findings offer valuable insights into the potential evolution of social networks towards more equitable or biased influence ecosystems."
2507.04222,"Vaccine infodemics, driven by misinformation, disinformation, and inauthentic online behaviours, pose significant threats to global public health. This paper presents our response to this challenge, demonstrating how we developed VaxPulse Vaccine Infodemic Risk Assessment Lifecycle (VIRAL), an AI-powered social listening platform designed to monitor and assess vaccine-related infodemic risks. Leveraging interdisciplinary expertise and international collaborations, VaxPulse VIRAL integrates machine learning methods, including deep learning, active learning, and data augmentation, to provide real-time insights into public sentiments, misinformation trends, and social bot activity. Iterative feedback from domain experts and stakeholders has guided the development of dynamic dashboards that offer tailored, actionable insights to support immunisation programs and address information disorder. Ongoing improvements to VaxPulse will continue through collaboration with our international network and community leaders."
2507.04534,"Short-form video platforms such as YouTube Shorts increasingly shape how information is consumed, yet the effects of engagement-driven algorithms on content exposure remain poorly understood. This study investigates how different viewing behaviors, including fast scrolling or skipping, influence the relevance and topical continuity of recommended videos. Using a dataset of over 404,000 videos, we simulate viewer interactions across both broader geopolitical themes and more narrowly focused conflicts, including topics related to Russia, China, the Russia-Ukraine War, and the South China Sea dispute. We assess how relevance shifts across recommendation chains under varying watch-time conditions, using GPT-4o to evaluate semantic alignment between videos. Our analysis reveals patterns of amplification, drift, and topic generalization, with significant implications for content diversity and platform accountability. By bridging perspectives from computer science, media studies, and political communication, this work contributes a multidisciplinary understanding of how engagement cues influence algorithmic pathways in short-form content ecosystems."
2507.04605,"The rapid growth of YouTube Shorts, now serving over 2 billion monthly users, reflects a global shift toward short-form video as a dominant mode of online content consumption. This study investigates algorithmic bias in YouTube Shorts' recommendation system by analyzing how watch-time duration, topic sensitivity, and engagement metrics influence content visibility and drift. We focus on three content domains: the South China Sea dispute, the 2024 Taiwan presidential election, and general YouTube Shorts content. Using generative AI models, we classified 685,842 videos across relevance, topic category, and emotional tone. Our results reveal a consistent drift away from politically sensitive content toward entertainment-focused videos. Emotion analysis shows a systematic preference for joyful or neutral content, while engagement patterns indicate that highly viewed and liked videos are disproportionately promoted, reinforcing popularity bias. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of algorithmic drift in YouTube Shorts based on textual content, emotional tone, topic categorization, and varying watch-time conditions. These findings offer new insights into how algorithmic design shapes content exposure, with implications for platform transparency and information diversity."
2507.04656,"The recent vaccine-related infodemic has amplified public concerns, highlighting the need for proactive misinformation management. We describe how we enhanced the reporting surveillance system of Victoria's vaccine safety service, SAEFVIC, through the incorporation of new information sources for public sentiment analysis, topics of discussion, and hesitancies about vaccinations online. Using VaxPulse, a multi-step framework, we integrate adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) with sentiment analysis, demonstrating the importance of contextualising public concerns. Additionally, we emphasise the need to address non-English languages to stratify concerns across ethno-lingual communities, providing valuable insights for vaccine uptake strategies and combating mis/disinformation. The framework is applied to real-world examples and a case study on women's vaccine hesitancy, showcasing its benefits and adaptability by identifying public opinion from online media."
2507.04923,"Since the European Union introduced its Circular Economy (CE) Action Plan in 2015, CE research has expanded rapidly. However, the structure of this emerging field - both in terms of its constituent disciplines and researcher dynamics - remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we analyze over 25,000 CE-related publications from Scopus by combining conventional bibliometric approaches with advanced machine learning techniques, including text embeddings and clustering. This hybrid method enables both a macro-level mapping of research domains and a micro-level investigation of individual researchers' disciplinary backgrounds and collaborations.We classify CE research into 16 distinct clusters, identifying the original disciplines of researchers and visualizing patterns of interdisciplinary collaboration. Building on this foundation, we ask: Which CE-related research domains receive the most attention in academic and policy contexts? And how are different types of interdisciplinary collaboration associated with research impact?Our findings show that research in business and management attracts substantial academic and policy attention, while engineering research - though less visible - tends to achieve higher funding success. This suggests a positive dynamic in which the former draws attention to CE issues and the latter secures the economic resources necessary to realize them.We further demonstrate that CE papers co-authored by researchers from different disciplines tend to show higher research impact than intradisciplinary work. Qualitative case analyses also highlight this tendency. Centered particularly on collaborations between business-oriented and engineering-oriented disciplines, our findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary efforts in CE research and offer insights for guiding future cross-disciplinary engagement in the field."
2507.04995,"Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) provide a rich foundation for modeling urban behavior through iNETs (Interest Networks), which capture how user interests are distributed throughout urban spaces. This study compares iNETs across platforms (Google Places and Foursquare) and spatial granularities, showing that coarser levels reveal more consistent cross-platform patterns, while finer granularities expose subtle, platform-specific behaviors. Our analysis finds that, in general, user interest is primarily shaped by geographic proximity and venue similarity, while socioeconomic and political contexts play a lesser role. Building on these insights, we develop a multi-level, explainable recommendation system that predicts high-interest urban regions for different user types. The model adapts to behavior profiles -- such as explorers, who are driven by proximity, and returners, who prefer familiar venues -- and provides natural-language explanations using explainable AI (XAI) techniques. To support our approach, we introduce h3-cities, a tool for multi-scale spatial analysis, and release a public demo for interactively exploring personalized urban recommendations. Our findings contribute to urban mobility research by providing scalable, context-aware, and interpretable recommendation systems."
2507.06034,"We explore the influence and interconnectivity of philosophical thinkers within the Wikipedia knowledge network. Using a dataset of 237 articles dedicated to philosophers across nine different language editions (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish), we apply the PageRank and CheiRank algorithms to analyze their relative ranking and influence in each linguistic context. Furthermore, we compare our results with entries from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, providing insight into the differences between general knowledge networks like Wikipedia and specialized philosophical databases. A key focus of our analysis is the sub-network of 21 presocratic philosophers, grouped into four traditional schools: Italic (Pythagorean + Eleatic), Ionian, Abderian (Atomist), and Sophist. Using the reduced Google matrix method, we uncover both direct and hidden links between these early thinkers, offering new perspectives on their intellectual relationships and influence within the Western philosophical tradition."
2507.06086,"Ensuring secure and efficient data processing in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems is a critical challenge. While quantum key distribution (QKD) offers unconditionally secure key exchange and homomorphic encryption (HE) enables privacy-preserving data processing, existing research fails to address the comprehensive trade-offs among QKD utility, HE security, and system costs. This paper proposes a novel framework integrating QKD, transciphering, and HE for secure and efficient MEC. QKD distributes symmetric keys, transciphering bridges symmetric encryption, and HE processes encrypted data at the server. We formulate an optimization problem balancing QKD utility, HE security, processing and wireless transmission costs. However, the formulated optimization is non-convex and NPhard. To solve it efficiently, we propose the Quantum-enhanced Homomorphic Encryption resource allocation (QuHE) algorithm. Theoretical analysis proves the proposed QuHE algorithm's convergence and optimality, and simulations demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple performance metrics."
2507.06164,"Complex networks have become essential tools for understanding diverse phenomena in social systems, traffic systems, biomolecular systems, and financial systems. Identifying critical nodes is a central theme in contemporary research, serving as a vital bridge between theoretical foundations and practical applications. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity and structural heterogeneity characterizing real-world networks, with particular emphasis on dynamic and higher-order networks, present substantial obstacles to the development of universal frameworks for critical node identification. This paper provides a comprehensive review of critical node identification techniques, categorizing them into seven main classes: centrality, critical nodes deletion problem, influence maximization, network control, artificial intelligence, higher-order and dynamic methods. Our review bridges the gaps in existing surveys by systematically classifying methods based on their methodological foundations and practical implications, and by highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability across different network types. Our work enhances the understanding of critical node research by identifying key challenges, such as algorithmic universality, real-time evaluation in dynamic networks, analysis of higher-order structures, and computational efficiency in large-scale networks. The structured synthesis consolidates current progress and highlights open questions, particularly in modeling temporal dynamics, advancing efficient algorithms, integrating machine learning approaches, and developing scalable and interpretable metrics for complex systems."
2507.06465,"Temporal networks consisting of timestamped interactions between a set of nodes provide a useful representation for analyzing complex networked systems that evolve over time. Beyond pairwise interactions between nodes, temporal motifs capture patterns of higher-order interactions such as directed triangles over short time periods. We propose temporal motif participation profiles (TMPPs) to capture the behavior of nodes in temporal motifs. Two nodes with similar TMPPs take similar positions within temporal motifs, possibly with different nodes. TMPPs serve as unsupervised embeddings for nodes in temporal networks that are directly interpretable, as each entry denotes the frequency at which a node participates in a particular position in a specific temporal motif. We demonstrate that clustering TMPPs reveals groups of nodes with similar roles in a temporal network through simulation experiments and a case study on a network of militarized interstate disputes."
2507.06541,"In recent years, there has been a growing effort to develop effective and efficient algorithms for fake account detection in online social networks. This survey comprehensively reviews existing methods, with a focus on graph-based techniques that utilise topological features of social graphs (in addition to account information, such as their shared contents and profile data) to distinguish between fake and real accounts. We provide several categorisations of these methods (for example, based on techniques used, input data, and detection time), discuss their strengths and limitations, and explain how these methods connect in the broader context. We also investigate the available datasets, including both real-world data and synthesised models. We conclude the paper by proposing several potential avenues for future research."
2507.07036,"Spatial phenomena often exhibit heterogeneity across spatial extents and in proximity, making them complex to model-especially in dynamic regions like ice shelves and sea ice. In this study, we address this challenge by exploring the linkages between sea ice retreat and Antarctic ice shelf (AIS) melt. Although atmospheric forcing and basal melting have been widely studied, the direct impact of sea ice retreat on AIS mass loss remains underexplored. Traditional models treat sea ice and AIS as separate systems. It limits their ability to capture localized linkages and cascading feedback. To overcome this, we propose Spatial-Link, a novel graph-based framework that quantifies spatial heterogeneity to capture linkages between sea ice retreat and AIS melt. Our method constructs a spatial graph using Delaunay triangulation of satellite-derived ice change matrices, where nodes represent regions of significant change and edges encode proximity and directional consistency. We extract and statistically validate linkage paths using breadth-first search and Monte Carlo simulations. Results reveal non-local, spatially heterogeneous coupling patterns, suggesting sea ice loss can initiate or amplify downstream AIS melt. Our analysis shows how sea ice retreat evolves over an oceanic grid and progresses toward ice shelves-establishing a direct linkage. To our knowledge, this is the first proposed methodology linking sea ice retreat to AIS melt. Spatial-Link offers a scalable, data-driven tool to improve sea-level rise projections and inform climate adaptation strategies."
2507.0766,"Traditional network analysis focuses on binary edges, while real-world relationships are more nuanced, encompassing cooperation, neutrality, and conflict. The rise of negative edges in social media discussions spurred interest in analyzing signed interactions, especially in polarized debates. However, the vast data generated by digital networks presents challenges for traditional methods like Stochastic Block Models (SBM) and Exponential Family Random Graph Models (ERGM), particularly due to the homogeneity assumption and global dependence, which become increasingly unrealistic as network size grows. To address this, we propose a novel method that combines the strengths of SBM and ERGM while mitigating their weaknesses by incorporating local dependence based on non-overlapping blocks. Our approach involves a two-step process: first, decomposing the network into sub-networks using SBM approximation, and then estimating parameters using ERGM methods. We validate our method on large synthetic networks and apply it to a signed Wikipedia network of thousands of editors. Through the use of local dependence, we find patterns consistent with structural balance theory."
2507.07727,"Understanding and predicting mobility dynamics in transportation networks is critical for infrastructure planning, resilience analysis, and traffic management. Traditional graph-based models typically assume memoryless movement, limiting their ability to capture sequential dependencies inherent in real-world mobility patterns. In this study, we introduce a novel higher-order network framework for modeling memory-dependent dynamics in transportation systems. By extending classical graph representations through higher-order Markov chains and de Bruijn graph structures, our framework encodes the spatial and temporal ordering of traversed paths, enabling the analysis of structurally and functionally critical components with improved fidelity. We generalize key network analytics, including betweenness centrality, PageRank, and next-step prediction, to this higher-order setting and validate our approach on the Sioux Falls transportation network using agent-based trajectory data generated with MATSim. Experimental results demonstrate that higher-order models outperform first-order baselines across multiple tasks, with the third-order model achieving an optimal balance between predictive accuracy and model complexity. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating memory effects into network-based transportation analysis and offer a scalable, data-driven methodology for capturing complex mobility behaviors in infrastructure systems."
2507.07884,"Is demand for conspiracy theories online linked to real-world hate crimes? By analyzing online search trends for 36 racially and politically-charged conspiracy theories in Michigan (2015-2019), we employ a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to predict hate crime occurrences offline. A subset of theories including the Rothschilds family, Q-Anon, and The Great Replacement improves prediction accuracy, with effects emerging two to three weeks after fluctuations in searches. However, most theories showed no clear connection to offline hate crimes. Aligning with neutralization and differential association theories, our findings provide a partial empirical link between specific racially charged conspiracy theories and real-world violence. Just as well, this study underscores the potential for machine learning to be used in identifying harmful online patterns and advancing social science research."
2507.08169,"News outlets are well known to have political associations, and many national outlets cultivate political biases to cater to different audiences. Journalists working for these news outlets have a big impact on the stories they cover. In this work, we present a methodology to analyze the role of journalists, affiliated with popular news outlets, in propagating their bias using some form of propaganda-like language. We introduce JMBX(Journalist Media Bias on X), a systematically collected and annotated dataset of 1874 tweets from Twitter (now known as X). These tweets are authored by popular journalists from 10 news outlets whose political biases range from extreme left to extreme right. We extract several insights from the data and conclude that journalists who are affiliated with outlets with extreme biases are more likely to use propaganda-like language in their writings compared to those who are affiliated with outlets with mild political leans. We compare eight different Large Language Models (LLM) by OpenAI and Google. We find that LLMs generally performs better when detecting propaganda in social media and news article compared to BERT-based model which is fine-tuned for propaganda detection. While the performance improvements of using large language models (LLMs) are significant, they come at a notable monetary and environmental cost. This study provides an analysis of both the financial costs, based on token usage, and the environmental impact, utilizing tools that estimate carbon emissions associated with LLM operations."
2507.08265,"The source detection problem in network analysis involves identifying the origins of diffusion processes, such as disease outbreaks or misinformation propagation. Traditional methods often focus on single sources, whereas real-world scenarios frequently involve multiple sources, complicating detection efforts. This study addresses the multiple-source detection (MSD) problem by integrating edge clustering algorithms into the community-based label propagation framework, effectively handling mixed-membership issues where nodes belong to multiple communities.The proposed approach applies the automated latent space edge clustering model to a network, partitioning infected networks into edge-based clusters to identify multiple sources. Simulation studies on ADD HEALTH social network datasets demonstrate that this method achieves superior accuracy, as measured by the F1-Measure, compared to state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. The results highlight the robustness of edge clustering in accurately detecting sources, particularly in networks with complex and overlapping source regions. This work advances the applicability of clustering-based methods to MSD problems, offering improved accuracy and adaptability for real-world network analyses."
2507.08328,"Hypergraphs, increasingly utilised to model complex and diverse relationships in modern networks, have gained significant attention for representing intricate higher-order interactions. Among various challenges, cohesive subgraph discovery is one of the fundamental problems and offers deep insights into these structures, yet the task of selecting appropriate parameters is an open question. To address this question, we aim to design an efficient indexing structure to retrieve cohesive subgraphs in an online manner. The main idea is to enable the discovery of corresponding structures within a reasonable time without the need for exhaustive graph traversals. Our method enables faster and more effective retrieval of cohesive structures, which supports decision-making in applications that require online analysis of large-scale hypergraphs. Through extensive experiments on real-world networks, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed indexing technique."
2507.08363,"The stability of communities - whether biological, social, economic, technological or ecological depends on the balance between cooperation and cheating. While cooperation strengthens communities, selfish individuals, or ""cheaters,"" exploit collective benefits without contributing. If cheaters become too prevalent, they can trigger the collapse of cooperation and of the community, often in an abrupt manner. A key challenge is determining whether the risk of such a collapse can be detected in advance. To address this, we use a combination of evolutionary graph theory and machine learning to examine how one can predict the unravel of cooperation on complex networks. By introducing few cheaters into a structured population, we employ machine learning to detect and anticipate the spreading of cheaters and cooperation collapse. Using temporal and structural data, the presented results show that prediction accuracy improves with stronger selection strength and larger observation windows, with CNN-Seq-LSTM and Seq-LSTM best performing models. Moreover, the accuracy for the predictions depends crucially on the type of game played between cooperators and cheaters (i.e., accuracy improves when it is more advantageous to defect) and on the community structure. Overall, this work introduces a machine learning approach into detecting abrupt shifts in evolutionary graph theory and offer potential strategies for anticipating and preventing cooperation collapse in complex social networks."
2507.09055,"The rapid spread of health misinformation on online social networks (OSNs) during global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges to public health, social stability, and institutional trust. Centrality metrics have long been pivotal in understanding the dynamics of information flow, particularly in the context of health misinformation. However, the increasing complexity and dynamism of online networks, especially during crises, highlight the limitations of these traditional approaches. This study introduces and compares three novel centrality metrics: dynamic influence centrality (DIC), health misinformation vulnerability centrality (MVC), and propagation centrality (PC). These metrics incorporate temporal dynamics, susceptibility, and multilayered network interactions. Using the FibVID dataset, we compared traditional and novel metrics to identify influential nodes, propagation pathways, and misinformation influencers. Traditional metrics identified 29 influential nodes, while the new metrics uncovered 24 unique nodes, resulting in 42 combined nodes, an increase of 44.83%. Baseline interventions reduced health misinformation by 50%, while incorporating the new metrics increased this to 62.5%, an improvement of 25%. To evaluate the broader applicability of the proposed metrics, we validated our framework on a second dataset, Monant Medical Misinformation, which covers a diverse range of health misinformation discussions beyond COVID-19. The results confirmed that the advanced metrics generalised successfully, identifying distinct influential actors not captured by traditional methods. In general, the findings suggest that a combination of traditional and novel centrality measures offers a more robust and generalisable framework for understanding and mitigating the spread of health misinformation in different online network contexts."
2507.09149,"Health misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly challenged public health efforts globally. This study applies the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to enhance misinformation detection on social media using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The model aims to enhance the detection accuracy and reliability of misinformation classification by integrating ELM-based features such as text readability, sentiment polarity, and heuristic cues (e.g., punctuation frequency). The enhanced model achieved an accuracy of 97.37%, precision of 96.88%, recall of 98.50%, F1-score of 97.41%, and ROC-AUC of 99.50%. A combined model incorporating feature engineering further improved performance, achieving a precision of 98.88%, recall of 99.80%, F1-score of 99.41%, and ROC-AUC of 99.80%. These findings highlight the value of ELM features in improving detection performance, offering valuable contextual information. This study demonstrates the practical application of psychological theories in developing advanced machine learning algorithms to address health misinformation effectively."
2507.09657,"We use generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to simulate a social network in a shared residential building, driving the temperature decisions for a central heating system. Agents, divided into Family Members and Representatives, consider personal preferences, personal traits, connections, and weather conditions. Daily simulations involve family-level consensus followed by building-wide decisions among representatives. We tested three personality traits distributions (positive, mixed, and negative) and found that positive traits correlate with higher happiness and stronger friendships. Temperature preferences, assertiveness, and selflessness have a significant impact on happiness and decisions. This work demonstrates how LLM-driven agents can help simulate nuanced human behavior where complex real-life human simulations are difficult to set."
2507.10262,"Retrieving cohesive subgraphs in networks is a fundamental problem in social network analysis and graph data management. These subgraphs can be used for marketing strategies or recommendation systems. Despite the introduction of numerous models over the years, a systematic comparison of their performance, especially across varied network configurations, remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluated various cohesive subgraph models using task-based evaluations and conducted extensive experimental studies on both synthetic and real-world networks. Thus, we unveil the characteristics of cohesive subgraph models, highlighting their efficiency and applicability. Our findings not only provide a detailed evaluation of current models but also lay the groundwork for future research by shedding light on the balance between the interpretability and cohesion of the subgraphs. This research guides the selection of suitable models for specific analytical needs and applications, providing valuable insights."
2507.1057,"Hypergraphs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems and networks with higher-order interactions beyond simple pairwise relationships. However, graph-based clustering approaches, which focus primarily on pairwise relations, fail to represent higher-order interactions, often resulting in low-quality clustering outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for local clustering in hypergraphs based on higher-order motifs, small connected subgraphs in which nodes may be linked by interactions of any order, extending motif-based techniques previously applied to standard graphs. Our method exploits hypergraph-specific higher-order motifs to better characterize local structures and optimize motif conductance. We propose two alternative strategies for identifying local clusters around a seed hyperedge: a core-based method utilizing hypergraph core decomposition and a BFS-based method based on breadth-first exploration. We construct an auxiliary hypergraph to facilitate efficient partitioning and introduce a framework for local motif-based clustering. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide a comparative analysis of the two proposed clustering strategies in terms of clustering quality and computational efficiency."
2507.10608,"Conventional anti-money laundering (AML) systems predominantly focus on identifying anomalous entities or transactions, flagging them for manual investigation based on statistical deviation or suspicious behavior. This paradigm, however, misconstrues the true nature of money laundering, which is rarely anomalous but often deliberate, repeated, and concealed within consistent behavioral routines. In this paper, we challenge the entity-centric approach and propose a network-theoretic perspective that emphasizes detecting predefined laundering patterns across directed transaction networks. We introduce the notion of behavioral consistency as the core trait of laundering activity, and argue that such patterns are better captured through subgraph structures expressing semantic and functional roles - not solely geometry. Crucially, we explore the concept of pattern fragility: the sensitivity of laundering patterns to small attribute changes and, conversely, their semantic robustness even under drastic topological transformations. We claim that laundering detection should not hinge on statistical outliers, but on preservation of behavioral essence, and propose a reconceptualization of pattern similarity grounded in this insight. This philosophical and practical shift has implications for how AML systems model, scan, and interpret networks in the fight against financial crime."
2507.10795,"The Artificial Benchmark for Community Detection (ABCD) model is a random graph model with community structure and power-law distribution for both degrees and community sizes. The model generates graphs similar to the well-known LFR model but it is faster, more interpretable, and can be investigated analytically. In this paper, we use the underlying ingredients of the ABCD model and introduce its variant for multilayer networks, mABCD."
2507.10936,"State-sponsored information operations (IOs) increasingly influence global discourse on social media platforms, yet their emotional and rhetorical strategies remain inadequately characterized in scientific literature. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of toxic language deployment within such campaigns, examining 56 million posts from over 42 thousand accounts linked to 18 distinct geopolitical entities on X/Twitter. Using Google's Perspective API, we systematically detect and quantify six categories of toxic content and analyze their distribution across national origins, linguistic structures, and engagement metrics, providing essential information regarding the underlying patterns of such operations. Our findings reveal that while toxic content constitutes only 1.53% of all posts, they are associated with disproportionately high engagement and appear to be strategically deployed in specific geopolitical contexts. Notably, toxic content originating from Russian influence operations receives significantly higher user engagement compared to influence operations from any other country in our dataset. Our code is available atthis https URL."
2507.11057,"Delineating areas within metropolitan regions stands as an important focus among urban researchers, shedding light on the urban perimeters shaped by evolving population dynamics. Applications to urban science are numerous, from facilitating comparisons between delineated districts and administrative divisions to informing policymakers of the shifting economic and labor landscapes. In this study, we propose using commute networks sourced from the census for the purpose of urban delineation, by modeling them with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture. We derive low-dimensional representations of granular urban areas (nodes) using GNNs. Subsequently, nodes' embeddings are clustered to identify spatially cohesive communities in urban areas. Our experiments across the U.S. demonstrate the effectiveness of network embeddings in capturing significant socioeconomic disparities between communities in various cities, particularly in factors such as median household income. The role of census mobility data in regional delineation is also noted, and we establish the utility of GNNs in urban community detection, as a powerful alternative to existing methods in this domain. The results offer insights into the wider effects of commute networks and their use in building meaningful representations of urban regions."
2507.1109,"With the rapid growth of online social networks, strengthening their stability has emerged as a key research focus. This study aims to identify influential relationships that significantly impact community stability. In this paper, we introduce and explore the anchor trussness reinforcement problem to reinforce the overall user engagement of networks by anchoring some edges. Specifically, for a given graph $G$ and a budget $b$, we aim to identify $b$ edges whose anchoring maximizes the trussness gain, which is the cumulative increment of trussness across all edges in $G$. We establish the NP-hardness of the problem. To address this problem, we introduce a greedy framework that iteratively selects the current best edge. To scale for larger networks, we first propose an upward-route method to constrain potential trussness increment edges. Augmented with a support check strategy, this approach enables the efficient computation of the trussness gain for anchoring one edge. Then, we design a classification tree structure to minimize redundant computations in each iteration by organizing edges based on their trussness. We conduct extensive experiments on 8 real-world networks to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model and methods."
2507.12007,"Predicting changes in consumer attention for cultural products, such as books, movies, and songs, is notoriously difficult. Past research on predicting the popularity of individual products suggests the existence of intrinsic prediction limits. However, little is known about the limits for predicting collective attention across cultural products. Here, we analyze four years of nationwide library loan data for approximately 2 million individuals, comprising over 100 million loans of more than 660,000 unique books. We find that culture, as measured by popularity distributions of loaned books, drifts continually from month to month at a near-constant rate, leading to a growing divergence over time, and that drifts vary between different book genres. By linking book loans to registry data, we investigate the influence of age, sex, educational level, and geographical area on cultural drift, finding heterogeneous effects from the different demographic groups. Our findings have important implications for market forecasting and developing robust recommender systems, highlighting the need to account for specific drift dynamics for different types of items and demographic groups."
2507.12063,"A wide variety of information is disseminated through social media, and content that spreads at scale can have tangible effects on the real world. To curb the spread of harmful content and promote the dissemination of reliable information, research on cascade graph mining has attracted increasing attention. A promising approach in this area is Contrastive Cascade Graph Learning (CCGL). One important task in cascade graph mining is cascade classification, which involves categorizing cascade graphs based on their structural characteristics. Although CCGL is expected to be effective for this task, its performance has not yet been thoroughly evaluated. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of CCGL for cascade classification. Our findings demonstrate the strong performance of CCGL in capturing platform- and model-specific structural patterns in cascade graphs, highlighting its potential for a range of downstream information diffusion analysis tasks."
2507.12108,"Coordinated online behavior, which spans from beneficial collective actions to harmful manipulation such as disinformation campaigns, has become a key focus in digital ecosystem analysis. Traditional methods often rely on monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other. However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of coordination dynamics. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze coordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the integrity of digital platforms."
2507.12711,"Dismantling criminal networks or containing epidemics or misinformation through node removal is a well-studied problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of such efforts, one must measure the strength of the network before and after node removal. Process P1 is considered more effective than P2 if the strength of the residual network after removing k nodes via P1 is smaller than that from P2. This leads to the central question: How should network strength be measured?Existing metrics rely solely on structural properties of the graph, such as connectivity. However, in real-world scenarios, particularly in law enforcement, the perception of agents regarding network strength can differ significantly from structural assessments. These perceptions are often ignored in traditional metrics.We propose a new strength metric that integrates both structural properties and human perception. Using human subject surveys, we validate our approach against existing metrics. Our metric not only aligns more closely with human judgment but also outperforms traditional methods in identifying authoritative nodes and effectively dismantling both synthetic and real-world networks."
2507.1288,"Information diffusion prediction (IDP) is a pivotal task for understanding how information propagates among users. Most existing methods commonly adhere to a conventional training-test paradigm, where models are pretrained on training data and then directly applied to test samples. However, the success of this paradigm hinges on the assumption that the data are independently and identically distributed, which often fails in practical social networks due to the inherent uncertainty and variability of user behavior. In the paper, we address the novel challenge of distribution shifts within IDP tasks and propose a robust test-time training (TTT)-based framework for multi-scale diffusion prediction, named T3MAL. The core idea is to flexibly adapt a trained model to accommodate the distribution of each test instance before making predictions via a self-supervised auxiliary task. Specifically, T3MAL introduces a BYOL-inspired self-supervised auxiliary network that shares a common feature extraction backbone with the primary diffusion prediction network to guide instance-specific adaptation during testing. Furthermore, T3MAL enables fast and accurate test-time adaptation by incorporating a novel meta-auxiliary learning scheme and a lightweight adaptor, which together provide better weight initialization for TTT and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that T3MAL outperforms various state-of-the-art methods."
2507.13059,"We revisit the classical friendship paradox which states that on an average one's friends have at least as many friends as oneself and generalize it to a variety of network centrality measures. In particular, we show that for any irreducible, undirected graph $G$, the ""friends-average"" of degree, eigenvector-centrality, walk-count, Katz, and PageRank centralities exceeds the global average. We show that the result follows from the variational characterisation of the eigenvector corresponding to the Perron eigenvalue."
2507.13366,"Urban mobility data has significant connections with economic growth and plays an essential role in various smart-city applications. However, due to privacy concerns and substantial data collection costs, fine-grained human mobility trajectories are difficult to become publicly available on a large scale. A promising solution to address this issue is trajectory synthesizing. However, existing works often ignore the inherent structural complexity of trajectories, unable to handle complicated high-dimensional distributions and generate realistic fine-grained trajectories. In this paper, we propose Cardiff, a coarse-to-fine Cascaded hybrid diffusion-based trajectory synthesizing framework for fine-grained and privacy-preserving mobility generation. By leveraging the hierarchical nature of urban mobility, Cardiff decomposes the generation process into two distinct levels, i.e., discrete road segment-level and continuous fine-grained GPS-level: (i) In the segment-level, to reduce computational costs and redundancy in raw trajectories, we first encode the discrete road segments into low-dimensional latent embeddings and design a diffusion transformer-based latent denoising network for segment-level trajectory synthesis. (ii) Taking the first stage of generation as conditions, we then design a fine-grained GPS-level conditional denoising network with a noise augmentation mechanism to achieve robust and high-fidelity generation. Additionally, the Cardiff framework not only progressively generates high-fidelity trajectories through cascaded denoising but also flexibly enables a tunable balance between privacy preservation and utility. Experimental results on three large real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics."
2507.13368,"Deep graph clustering (DGC), which aims to unsupervisedly separate the nodes in an attribute graph into different clusters, has seen substantial potential in various industrial scenarios like community detection and recommendation. However, the real-world attribute graphs, e.g., social networks interactions, are usually large-scale and attribute-missing. To solve these two problems, we propose a novel DGC method termed \underline{\textbf{C}}omplementary \underline{\textbf{M}}ulti-\underline{\textbf{V}}iew \underline{\textbf{N}}eighborhood \underline{\textbf{D}}ifferentiation (\textit{CMV-ND}), which preprocesses graph structural information into multiple views in a complete but non-redundant manner. First, to ensure completeness of the structural information, we propose a recursive neighborhood search that recursively explores the local structure of the graph by completely expanding node neighborhoods across different hop distances. Second, to eliminate the redundancy between neighborhoods at different hops, we introduce a neighborhood differential strategy that ensures no overlapping nodes between the differential hop representations. Then, we construct $K+1$ complementary views from the $K$ differential hop representations and the features of the target node. Last, we apply existing multi-view clustering or DGC methods to the views. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets demonstrate that CMV-ND significantly improves the performance of various methods."
2507.1337,"The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it also presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus. Existing methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group connections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke psychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus. Additionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local consensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these issues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework, H-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles, considering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts. Additionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that adaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths through a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user interactions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0% to 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This approach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user interaction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance."
2507.13379,"The rise of digital platforms has enabled the large scale observation of individual and collective behavior through high resolution interaction data. This development has opened new analytical pathways for investigating how information circulates, how opinions evolve, and how coordination emerges in online environments. Yet despite a growing body of research, the field remains fragmented and marked by methodological heterogeneity, limited model validation, and weak integration across domains. This survey offers a systematic synthesis of empirical findings and formal models. We examine platform-level regularities, assess the methodological architectures that generate them, and evaluate the extent to which current modeling frameworks account for observed dynamics. The goal is to consolidate a shared empirical baseline and clarify the structural constraints that shape inference in this domain, laying the groundwork for more robust, comparable, and actionable analyses of online social systems."
2507.13398,"Conspiracy theories have long drawn public attention, but their explosive growth on platforms like Telegram during the COVID-19 pandemic raises pressing questions about their impact on societal trust, democracy, and public health. We provide a geographical, temporal and network analysis of the structure of of conspiracy-related German-language Telegram chats in a novel large-scale data set. We examine how information flows between regional user groups and influential broadcasting channels, revealing the interplay between decentralized discussions and content spread driven by a small number of key actors.Our findings reveal that conspiracy-related activity spikes during major COVID-19-related events, correlating with societal stressors and mirroring prior research on how crises amplify conspiratorial beliefs. By analysing the interplay between regional, national and transnational chats, we uncover how information flows from larger national or transnational discourse to localised, community-driven discussions. Furthermore, we find that the top 10% of chats account for 94% of all forwarded content, portraying the large influence of a few actors in disseminating information. However, these chats operate independently, with minimal interconnection between each other, primarily forwarding messages to low-traffic groups. Notably, 43% of links shared in the data set point to untrustworthy sources as identified by NewsGuard, a proportion far exceeding their share on other platforms and in other discourse contexts, underscoring the role of conspiracy-related discussions on Telegram as vector for the spread of misinformation."
2507.13477,"The Internet facilitates sex trafficking through adult service websites (ASWs) that host online advertisements for sexual services (sex ads). Since the closure of the popular sitethis http URL, the ecosystem of ASWs has expanded to include multiple competing sites that are hosted outside US jurisdiction. Gaining intelligence for counter-trafficking efforts requires collecting, linking, and cleaning the data from multiple sites. However, high ad volumes, disparate data types, and the existence of generic and misappropriated data make this process challenging. We present an end-to-end process for linking sex ad data and filtering potentially erroneous links. Outputs of the developed process have been used to inform counter-trafficking operations that have helped identify more than 60 potential victims of sex trafficking, some of whom are getting help to transition out of the life. Our process leverages concepts and techniques from network science, information systems, and artificial intelligence to link ads across sites at the level of an individual or unique posting entity. Our approach is computationally efficient, allowing millions of ads to be processed in under an hour. A key component of our process is an edge filtering procedure that identifies and removes potentially erroneous links in a graph representation of sex ad data. A comparison of the proposed process to an existing approach shows that our process is typically more computationally efficient and yields substantial increases in the number of individuals for which we can derive actionable intelligence. The proposed process is an efficient and effective approach for transforming the high volumes of disparate data from sex ads into intelligence that can save lives. It has been refined over years of collaboration with practitioners and represents a strong foundation upon which further counter-trafficking tools can be built."
2507.13577,"We represent interdependent infrastructure systems and communities alike with a hetero-functional graph (HFG) that encodes the dependencies between functionalities. This graph naturally imposes a partial order of functionalities that can inform the sequence of repair decisions to be made during a disaster across affected communities. However, using such technical criteria alone provides limited guidance at the point where the functionalities directly impact the communities, since these can be repaired in any order without violating the system constraints. To address this gap and improve resilience, we integrate community preferences to refine this partial order from the HFG into a total order. Our strategy involves getting the communities' opinions on their preferred sequence for repair crews to address infrastructure issues, considering potential constraints on resources. Due to the delay and cost associated with real-world survey data, we utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) as a proxy survey tool. We use the LLM to craft distinct personas representing individuals, each with varied disaster experiences. We construct diverse disaster scenarios, and each simulated persona provides input on prioritizing infrastructure repair needs across various communities. Finally, we apply learning algorithms to generate a global order based on the aggregated responses from these LLM-generated personas."
2507.13636,"This paper investigates inauthentic duplication on social media, where multiple accounts share identical misinformation tweets. Leveraging a dataset of misinformation verified by AltNews, an Indian fact-checking organization, we analyze over 12 million posts from 5,493 accounts known to have duplicated such content. Contrary to common assumptions that bots are primarily responsible for spreading false information, fewer than 1\% of these accounts exhibit bot-like behavior. We present TweeXster, a framework for detecting and analyzing duplication campaigns, revealing clusters of accounts involved in repeated and sometimes revived dissemination of false or abusive content."
2507.13939,"Transportation researchers and planners utilize a wide range of roadway metrics that are usually associated with different basemaps. Conflation is an important process for transferring these metrics onto a single basemap. However, conflation is often an expensive and time-consuming process based on proprietary algorithms that require manual verification.In this paper, an automated open-source process is used to conflate two basemaps: the linear reference system (LRS) basemap produced by the Virginia Department of Transportation and the OpenStreetMap (OSM) basemap for Virginia. This process loads one LRS route at a time, determines the correct direction of travel, interpolates to fill gaps larger than 12 meters, and then uses Valhalla's map-matching algorithm to find the corresponding points along OSM's segments. Valhalla's map-matching process uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Viterbi search-based approach to find the most likely OSM segments matching the LRS route.This work has three key contributions. First, it conflates the Virginia roadway network LRS map with OSM using an automated conflation method based on HMM and Viterbi search. Second, it demonstrates a novel open-source processing pipeline that could be replicated without the need for proprietary licenses. Finally, the overall conflation process yields over 98% successful matches, which is an improvement over most automated processes currently available for this type of conflation."
2507.14465,"This study examines how TikTok refugees moved to Xiaohongshu after TikTok was about to be banned in the United States. It utilizes Foucault's idea of heterotopia to demonstrate how Xiaohongshu became a crisis space for cross-cultural discussions across the Great Firewall. Through Critical Discourse Analysis of 586 user comments, the study reveals how Chinese and international users collaboratively constructed and contested a new online order through language negotiation, identity positioning, and playful platform policing. The findings highlight distinct discursive strategies between domestic and overseas users, reflecting both cultural resistance and adaptation. This research contributes to the understanding of digital migration, heterotopic spaces in social media, and emerging dynamics of cross-cultural discourse during geopolitical crises."
2507.14623,"This study examines cross-cultural interactions between Chinese users and self-identified ""TikTok Refugees""(foreign users who migrated to RedNote after TikTok's U.S. ban). Based on a dataset of 1,862 posts and 403,054 comments, we use large language model-based sentiment classification and BERT-based topic modelling to explore how both groups engage with the TikTok refugee phenomenon. We analyse what themes foreign users express, how Chinese users respond, how stances (Pro-China, Neutral, Pro-Foreign) shape emotional expression, and how affective responses differ across topics and identities. Results show strong affective asymmetry: Chinese users respond with varying emotional intensities across topics and stances: pride and praise dominate cultural threads, while political discussions elicit high levels of contempt and anger, especially from Pro-China commenters. Pro-Foreign users exhibit the strongest negative emotions across all topics, whereas neutral users express curiosity and joy but still reinforce mainstream discursive norms. Cross-topic comparisons reveal that appearance-related content produces the most emotionally balanced interactions, while politics generates the highest polarization. Our findings reveal distinct emotion-stance structures in Sino-foreign online interactions and offer empirical insights into identity negotiation in transnational digital publics."
2507.14696,"Faculty hiring shapes the flow of ideas, resources, and opportunities in academia, influencing not only individual career trajectories but also broader patterns of institutional prestige and scientific progress. While traditional studies have found strong correlations between faculty hiring and attributes such as doctoral department prestige and publication record, they rarely assess whether these associations generalize to individual hiring outcomes, particularly for future candidates outside the original sample. Here, we consider faculty placement as an individual-level prediction task. Our data consist of temporal co-authorship networks with conventional attributes such as doctoral department prestige and bibliometric features. We observe that using the co-authorship network significantly improves predictive accuracy by up to 10% over traditional indicators alone, with the largest gains observed for placements at the most elite (top-10) departments. Our results underscore the role that social networks, professional endorsements, and implicit advocacy play in faculty hiring beyond traditional measures of scholarly productivity and institutional prestige. By introducing a predictive framing of faculty placement and establishing the benefit of considering co-authorship networks, this work provides a new lens for understanding structural biases in academia that could inform targeted interventions aimed at increasing transparency, fairness, and equity in academic hiring practices."
2507.14864,"Online social networks have become an integral part of modern society, profoundly influencing how individuals form and exchange opinions across diverse domains ranging from politics to public health. The Friedkin-Johnsen model serves as a foundational framework for modeling opinion formation dynamics in such networks. In this paper, we address the computational task of efficiently determining the equilibrium opinion vector and associated metrics including polarization and disagreement, applicable to both directed and undirected social networks. We propose a deterministic local algorithm with relative error guarantees, scaling to networks exceeding ten million nodes. Further acceleration is achieved through integration with successive over-relaxation techniques, where a relaxation factor optimizes convergence rates. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world networks validate the practical effectiveness of our approaches, demonstrating significant improvements in computational efficiency and scalability compared to conventional methods."
2507.15124,"The rise of social networking platforms has amplified privacy threats as users increasingly share sensitive information across profiles, content, and social connections. We present a Comprehensive Privacy Risk Scoring (CPRS) framework that quantifies privacy risk by integrating user attributes, social graph structures, and user-generated content. Our framework computes risk scores across these dimensions using sensitivity, visibility, structural similarity, and entity-level analysis, then aggregates them into a unified risk score. We validate CPRS on two real-world datasets: the SNAP Facebook Ego Network (4,039 users) and the Koo microblogging dataset (1M posts, 1M comments). The average CPRS is 0.478 with equal weighting, rising to 0.501 in graph-sensitive scenarios. Component-wise, graph-based risks (mean 0.52) surpass content (0.48) and profile attributes (0.45). High-risk attributes include email, date of birth, and mobile number. Our user study with 100 participants shows 85% rated the dashboard as clear and actionable, confirming CPRS's practical utility. This work enables personalized privacy risk insights and contributes a holistic, scalable methodology for privacy management. Future directions include incorporating temporal dynamics and multimodal content for broader applicability."
2507.1546,"Personalized News Recommendation systems (PNR) have emerged as a solution to information overload by predicting and suggesting news items tailored to individual user interests. However, traditional PNR systems face several challenges, including an overreliance on textual content, common neglect of short-term user interests, and significant privacy concerns due to centralized data storage. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel multimodal federated learning-based approach for news recommendation. First, it integrates both textual and visual features of news items using a multimodal model, enabling a more comprehensive representation of content. Second, it employs a time-aware model that balances users' long-term and short-term interests through multi-head self-attention networks, improving recommendation accuracy. Finally, to enhance privacy, a federated learning framework is implemented, enabling collaborative model training without sharing user data. The framework divides the recommendation model into a large server-maintained news model and a lightweight user model shared between the server and clients. The client requests news representations (vectors) and a user model from the central server, then computes gradients with user local data, and finally sends their locally computed gradients to the server for aggregation. The central server aggregates gradients to update the global user model and news model. The updated news model is further used to infer news representation by the server. To further safeguard user privacy, a secure aggregation algorithm based on Shamir's secret sharing is employed. Experiments on a real-world news dataset demonstrate strong performance compared to existing systems, representing a significant advancement in privacy-preserving personalized news recommendation."
2507.16046,"The internet has transformed activism, giving rise to more organic, diverse, and dynamic social movements that transcend geo-political boundaries. Despite extensive research on the role of social media and the internet in cross-cultural activism, the fundamental motivations driving these global movements remain poorly understood. This study examines two plausible explanations for cross-cultural activism: first, that it is driven by influential online opinion leaders, and second, that it results from individuals resonating with emergent sets of beliefs, values, and norms. We conduct a case study of the interaction between K-pop fans and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement on Twitter following the murder of George Floyd. Our findings provide strong evidence that belief alignment, where people resonate with common beliefs, is a primary driver of cross-cultural interactions in digital activism. We also demonstrate that while the actions of potential opinion leaders--in this case, K-pop entertainers--may amplify activism and lead to further expressions of love and admiration from fans, they do not appear to be a direct cause of activism. Finally, we report some initial evidence that the interaction between BLM and K-pop led to slight increases in their overall belief similarity."
2507.16298,"WhatsApp tiplines, first launched in 2019 to combat misinformation, enable users to interact with fact-checkers to verify misleading content. This study analyzes 580 unique claims (tips) from 451 users, covering both high-resource languages (English, Hindi) and a low-resource language (Telugu) during the 2021 Indian assembly elections using a mixed-method approach. We categorize the claims into three categories, election, COVID-19, and others, and observe variations across languages. We compare content similarity through frequent word analysis and clustering of neural sentence embeddings. We also investigate user overlap across languages and fact-checking organizations. We measure the average time required to debunk claims and inform tipline users. Results reveal similarities in claims across languages, with some users submitting tips in multiple languages to the same fact-checkers. Fact-checkers generally require a couple of days to debunk a new claim and share the results with users. Notably, no user submits claims to multiple fact-checking organizations, indicating that each organization maintains a unique audience. We provide practical recommendations for using tiplines during elections with ethical consideration of users' information."
2507.16583,"Detection of communities in a graph entails identifying clusters of densely connected vertices; the area has a variety of important applications and a rich literature. The problem has previously been situated in the realm of error correcting codes by viewing a graph as a noisy version of the assumed underlying communities. In this paper, we introduce an encoding of community structure along with the resulting code's parameters. We then present a novel algorithm, SASH, to decode to estimated communities given an observed dataset. We demonstrate the performance of SASH via simulations on an assortative planted partition model and on the Zachary's Karate Club dataset."
2507.1682,"This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric and topic analysis of the disaster informatics literature published between January 2020 to September 2022. Leveraging a large-scale corpus and advanced techniques such as pre-trained language models and generative AI, we identify the most active countries, institutions, authors, collaboration networks, emergent topics, patterns among the most significant topics, and shifts in research priorities spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight (1) countries that were most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic were also among the most active, with each country having specific research interests, (2) countries and institutions within the same region or share a common language tend to collaborate, (3) top active authors tend to form close partnerships with one or two key partners, (4) authors typically specialized in one or two specific topics, while institutions had more diverse interests across several topics, and (5) the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced research priorities in disaster informatics, placing greater emphasis on public health. We further demonstrate that the field is converging on multidimensional resilience strategies and cross-sectoral data-sharing collaborations or projects, reflecting a heightened awareness of global vulnerability and interdependency. Collecting and quality assurance strategies, data analytic practices, LLM-based topic extraction and summarization approaches, and result visualization tools can be applied to comparable datasets or solve similar analytic problems. By mapping out the trends in disaster informatics, our analysis offers strategic insights for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars aiming to enhance disaster informatics capacities in an increasingly uncertain and complex risk landscape."
2507.16847,"Social media platforms serve as a significant medium for sharing personal emotions, daily activities, and various life events, ensuring individuals stay informed about the latest developments. From the initiation of an account, users progressively expand their circle of friends or followers, engaging actively by posting, commenting, and sharing content. Over time, user behavior on these platforms evolves, influenced by demographic attributes and the networks they form. In this study, we present a novel approach that leverages open-source models Llama-3-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct, Gemma-7B-IT through prompt engineering, combined with GPT-2, BERT, and RoBERTa using a joint embedding technique, to analyze and predict the evolution of user behavior on social media over their lifetime. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of these models to forecast future stages of a user's social evolution, including network changes, future connections, and shifts in user activities. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our approach, with GPT-2 achieving the lowest perplexity (8.21) in a Cross-modal configuration, outperforming RoBERTa (9.11) and BERT, and underscoring the importance of leveraging Cross-modal configurations for superior performance. This approach addresses critical challenges in social media, such as friend recommendations and activity predictions, offering insights into the trajectory of user behavior. By anticipating future interactions and activities, this research aims to provide early warnings about potential negative outcomes, enabling users to make informed decisions and mitigate risks in the long term."
2507.16848,"In the human-bot symbiotic information ecosystem, social bots play key roles in spreading and correcting disinformation. Understanding their influence is essential for risk control and better governance. However, current studies often rely on simplistic user and network modeling, overlook the dynamic behavior of bots, and lack quantitative evaluation of correction strategies. To fill these gaps, we propose MADD, a Multi Agent based framework for Disinformation Dissemination. MADD constructs a more realistic propagation network by integrating the Barabasi Albert Model for scale free topology and the Stochastic Block Model for community structures, while designing node attributes based on real world user data. Furthermore, MADD incorporates both malicious and legitimate bots, with their controlled dynamic participation allows for quantitative analysis of correction strategies. We evaluate MADD using individual and group level metrics. We experimentally verify the real world consistency of MADD user attributes and network structure, and we simulate the dissemination of six disinformation topics, demonstrating the differential effects of fact based and narrative based correction strategies."
2507.16857,"This study investigates potential indicators of coordinated influence activity among users participating in both r/Sino and r/China, two ideologically divergent Reddit communities focused on Chinese political discourse. Topic modeling and sentiment analysis are applied to all posts and comments authored by dual-subreddit users to construct a user-topic sentiment matrix. Individual sentiment patterns are compared to global topic baselines derived from the broader r/Sino and r/China populations. Behavioral profiling is performed using full user activity histories and metadata, incorporating measures such as lexical diversity, language consistency, account age, posting frequency, and karma distribution. Users exhibiting multiple behavioral anomalies are identified and examined within a subreddit co-participation network to assess structural overlap. The combined linguistic and behavioral analysis enables the identification of patterns consistent with inauthentic or strategically structured participation. These findings demonstrate the utility of integrating content and activity-based signals in the analysis of online influence behavior within contested information environments."
2507.16858,"Following the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters increasingly migrated from mainstream social media plat-forms like X (formerly Twitter) to decentralized alternatives such as Bluesky. This study investigates how Congressional Democrats use Bluesky to form networks of influence and disseminate political messaging in a platform environment that lacks algorithmic amplification. We employ a mixed-methods approach that combines social network analysis, expo-nential random graph modeling (ERGM), and transformer-based topic mod-eling (BERTopic) to analyze follows, mentions, reposts, and discourse pat-terns among 182 verified Democratic members of Congress. Our findings show that while party leaders such as Hakeem Jeffries and Elizabeth War-ren dominate visibility metrics, overlooked figures like Marcy Kaptur, Donald Beyer, and Dwight Evans occupy structurally central positions, suggesting latent influence within the digital party ecosystem. ERGM re-sults reveal significant homophily along ideological, state, and leadership lines, with Senate leadership exhibiting lower connectivity. Topic analysis identifies both shared themes (e.g., reproductive rights, foreign conflicts) and subgroup-specific issues, with The Squad showing the most distinct discourse profile. These results demonstrate the potential of decentralized platforms to reshape intra-party communication dynamics and highlight the need for continued computational research on elite political behavior in emerging digital environments."
2507.1686,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it easier to create realistic fake profiles on platforms like LinkedIn. This poses a significant risk for text-based fake profile detectors. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of existing detectors against LLM-generated profiles. While highly effective in detecting manually created fake profiles (False Accept Rate: 6-7%), the existing detectors fail to identify GPT-generated profiles (False Accept Rate: 42-52%). We propose GPT-assisted adversarial training as a countermeasure, restoring the False Accept Rate to between 1-7% without impacting the False Reject Rates (0.5-2%). Ablation studies revealed that detectors trained on combined numerical and textual embeddings exhibit the highest robustness, followed by those using numerical-only embeddings, and lastly those using textual-only embeddings. Complementary analysis on the ability of prompt-based GPT-4Turbo and human evaluators affirms the need for robust automated detectors such as the one proposed in this study."
2507.17177,"In social networks, it is often of interest to identify the most influential users who can successfully spread information to others. This is particularly important for marketing (e.g., targeting influencers for a marketing campaign) and to understand the dynamics of information diffusion (e.g., who is the most central user in the spreading of a certain type of information). However, different opinions often split the audience and make the network polarised. In polarised networks, information becomes soiled within communities in the network, and the most influential user within a network might not be the most influential across all communities. Additionally, influential users and their influence may change over time as users may change their opinion or choose to decrease or halt their engagement on the subject. In this work, we aim to study the temporal dynamics of users' influence in a polarised social network. We compare the stability of influence ranking using temporal centrality measures, while extending them to account for community structure across a number of network evolution behaviours. We show that we can successfully aggregate nodes into influence bands, and how to aggregate centrality scores to analyse the influence of communities over time. A modified version of the temporal independent cascade model and the temporal degree centrality perform the best in this setting, as they are able to reliably isolate nodes into their bands."
2507.17626,"We introduce Quotegraph, a novel large-scale social network derived from speaker-attributed quotations in English news articles published between 2008 and 2020. Quotegraph consists of 528 thousand unique nodes and 8.63 million directed edges, pointing from speakers to persons they mention. The nodes are linked to their corresponding items in Wikidata, thereby endowing the dataset with detailed biographic entity information, including nationality, gender, and political affiliation. Being derived from Quotebank, a massive corpus of quotations, relations in Quotegraph are additionally enriched with the information about the context in which they are featured. Each part of the network construction pipeline is language agnostic, enabling the construction of similar datasets based on non-English news corpora. We believe Quotegraph is a compelling resource for computational social scientists, complementary to online social networks, with the potential to yield novel insights into the behavior of public figures and how it is captured in the news."
2507.18652,"In this paper we analyze the PageRank of a complex network as a function of its personalization vector. By using this approach, a complete characterization of the existence and uniqueness of fixed points of PageRank of a graph is given in terms of the number and nature of its strongly connected components. The method presented includes the use of a feedback-PageRank in order to compute exactly the fixed points following the classic Power's Method in terms of the (left-hand) Perron vector of each strongly connected components."
2507.193,"Although news negativity is often studied, missing is comparative evidence on the prevalence of and engagement with negative political and non-political news posts on social media. We use 6,081,134 Facebook posts published between January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2024, by 97 media organizations in six countries (U.S., UK, Ireland, Poland, France, Spain) and develop two multilingual classifiers for labeling posts as (non-)political and (non-)negative. We show that: (1) negative news posts constitute a relatively small fraction (12.6%); (2) political news posts are neither more nor less negative than non-political news posts; (3) U.S. political news posts are less negative relative to the other countries on average (40% lower odds); (4) Negative news posts get 15% fewer likes and 13% fewer comments than non-negative news posts. Lastly, (5) we provide estimates of the proportion of the total volume of user engagement with negative news posts and show that only between 10.2% to 13.1% of engagement is linked to negative posts by the analyzed news organizations."
2507.19373,"Platforms, especially Facebook, are primary news sources in the US. In its widely criticized ""War on News,"" Meta algorithmically deprioritized news and political content. We use data from 40 news organizations (5,243,302 Facebook posts, 7,875,372,958 user reactions) and 21 non-news pages (396,468 posts; 1,909,088,308 reactions) between January 1, 2016 and February 13, 2025 to examine how these changes influenced news visibility on the platform. Reactions to news declined by 78% between 2021 and 2024 while reactions to non-news pages increased, indicating targeted suppression of news visibility. Low-quality sources were especially suppressed, yet the 2025 end to ""War on News"" increased user reactions to news, especially low-quality ones. These changes do not reflect decreased news supply, Facebook user base, or interest in news over this period."
2507.19702,"Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a critical task with a wide range of applications across different domains. However, existing approaches often face trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose 1D-CGS, a lightweight and effective hybrid model that integrates the speed of one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) with the topological representation power of GraphSAGE for efficient node ranking. The model uses a lightweight input representation built on two straightforward and significant topological features: node degree and average neighbor degree. These features are processed through 1D convolutions to extract local patterns, followed by GraphSAGE layers to aggregate neighborhood information. We formulate the node ranking task as a regression problem and use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to generate ground truth influence scores. 1D-CGS is initially trained on synthetic networks generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and then applied to real world networks for identifying influential nodes. Experimental evaluations on twelve real world networks demonstrate that 1D-CGS significantly outperforms traditional centrality measures and recent deep learning models in ranking accuracy, while operating in very fast runtime. The proposed model achieves an average improvement of 4.73% in Kendall's Tau correlation and 7.67% in Jaccard Similarity over the best performing deep learning baselines. It also achieves an average Monotonicity Index (MI) score 0.99 and produces near perfect rank distributions, indicating highly unique and discriminative rankings. Furthermore, all experiments confirm that 1D-CGS operates in a highly reasonable time, running significantly faster than existing deep learning methods, making it suitable for large scale applications."
2507.19792,"This paper proposes a mathematical model to study the coupled dynamics of a Recommender System (RS) algorithm and content consumers (users). The model posits that a large population of users, each with an opinion, consumes personalised content recommended by the RS. The RS can select from a range of content to recommend, based on users' past engagement, while users can engage with the content (like, watch), and in doing so, users' opinions evolve. This occurs repeatedly to capture the endless content available for user consumption on social media. We employ a campaign of Monte Carlo simulations using this model to study how recommender systems influence users' opinions, and in turn how users' opinions shape the subsequent recommended content. We take an interest in both the performance of the RS (e.g., how users engage with the content) and the user's opinions, focusing on polarisation and radicalisation of opinions. We find that different opinion distributions are more susceptible to becoming polarised than others, many content stances are ineffective in changing user opinions, and creating viral content is an effective measure in combating polarisation of opinions."
2507.20066,"This thesis develops a continuous scale measurement of similarity to disinformation narratives that can serve to detect disinformation and capture the nuanced, partial truths that are characteristic of it. To do so, two tools are developed and their methodologies are documented. The tracing tool takes tweets and a target narrative, rates the similarities of each to the target narrative, and graphs it as a timeline. The second narrative synthesis tool clusters tweets above a similarity threshold and generates the dominant narratives within each cluster. These tools are combined into a Tweet Narrative Analysis Dashboard. The tracing tool is validated on the GLUE STS-B benchmark, and then the two tools are used to analyze two case studies for further empirical validation. The first case study uses the target narrative ""The 2020 election was stolen"" and analyzes a dataset of Donald Trump's tweets during 2020. The second case study uses the target narrative, ""Transgender people are harmful to society"" and analyzes tens of thousands of tweets from the media outlets The New York Times, The Guardian, The Gateway Pundit, and Fox News. Together, the empirical findings from these case studies demonstrate semantic similarity for nuanced disinformation detection, tracing, and characterization.The tools developed in this thesis are hosted and can be accessed through the permission of the author.

2507.20265,"Collaborative content generation (CCG) enables collective creation of artifacts like scientific articles. Quality is a paramount concern in CCG, and a multitude of methods have been proposed to evaluate the quality of artifacts. Nevertheless, the majority of these methods are reliant on centralized architectures, which present challenges pertaining to security, privacy, and availability. Blockchain technology proffers a potential resolution to these challenges, by furnishing a decentralized and immutable ledger of quality scores. In this manuscript, we introduce a blockchain-based quality control model for CCG that uses a semi-iterative algorithm to interdependently compute quality scores of artifacts and reputation of nodes. Our model addresses critical challenges in academic informetrics, such as citation manipulation, transparency in collaborative scholarship, and decentralized trust in metric computation. Our model also exhibits sensitivity to processing latency, rendering it more agile in the presence of delays. Our model's quality scores, evaluated against PageRank and HITS baselines, show comparable performance, with additional assessments of throughput, latency, and robustness against malicious nodes confirming its reliability. A theoretical comparison with recent studies validates its feasibility for real world informetric application."
2507.20682,"Evaluating node importance is a critical aspect of analyzing complex systems, with broad applications in digital marketing, rumor suppression, and disease control. However, existing methods typically rely on conventional network structures and fail to capture the polyadic interactions intrinsic to many real-world systems. To address this limitation, we study key node identification in hypergraphs, where higher-order interactions are naturally modeled as hyperedges. We propose a novel framework, AHGA, which integrates an Autoencoder for extracting higher-order structural features, a HyperGraph neural network-based pre-training module (HGNN), and an Active learning-based fine-tuning process. This fine-tuning step plays a vital role in mitigating the gap between synthetic and real-world data, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and generalization across diverse hypergraph topologies. Extensive experiments on eight empirical hypergraphs show that AHGA outperforms classical centrality-based baselines by approximately 37.4%. Furthermore, the nodes identified by AHGA exhibit both high influence and strong structural disruption capability, demonstrating their superiority in detecting multifunctional nodes."
2507.21187,"Consumption of YouTube news videos significantly shapes public opinion and political narratives. While prior works have studied the longitudinal dissemination dynamics of YouTube News videos across extended periods, limited attention has been paid to the short-term trends. In this paper, we investigate the early-stage diffusion patterns and dispersion rate of news videos on YouTube, focusing on the first 24 hours. To this end, we introduce and analyze a rich dataset of over 50,000 videos across 75 countries and six continents. We provide the first quantitative evaluation of the 24-hour half-life of YouTube news videos as well as identify their distinct diffusion patterns. According to the findings, the average 24-hour half-life is approximately 7 hours, with substantial variance both within and across countries, ranging from as short as 2 hours to as long as 15 hours. Additionally, we explore the problem of predicting the latency of news videos' 24-hour half-lives. Leveraging the presented datasets, we train and contrast the performance of 6 different models based on statistical as well as Deep Learning techniques. The difference in prediction results across the models is traced and analyzed. Lastly, we investigate the importance of video- and channel-related predictors through Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The dataset, analysis codebase and the trained models are released atthis http URLto facilitate further research in this area."
2507.21418,"In the online public sphere, discussions about immigration often become increasingly fractious, marked by toxic language and polarization. Drawing on 4 million X posts over six months, we combine a user- and topic-centric approach to study how shifts in toxicity manifest as topical shifts. Our topic discovery method, which leverages instruction-based embeddings and recursive HDBSCAN, uncovers 157 fine-grained subtopics within the U.S. immigration discourse. We focus on users in four groups: (1) those with increasing toxicity, (2) those with decreasing toxicity, and two reference groups with no significant toxicity trend but matched toxicity levels. Treating each posting history as a trajectory through a five-dimensional topic space, we compare average group trajectories using permutational MANOVA. Our findings show that users with increasing toxicity drift toward alarmist, fear-based frames, whereas those with decreasing toxicity pivot toward legal and policy-focused themes. Both patterns diverge statistically significantly from their reference groups. This pipeline, which combines hierarchical topic discovery with trajectory analysis, offers a replicable method for studying dynamic conversations around social issues at scale."
2507.21903,"As news reporting becomes increasingly global and decentralized online, tracking related events across multiple sources presents significant challenges. Existing news summarization methods typically utilizes Large Language Models and Graphical methods on article-based summaries. However, this is not effective since it only considers the textual content of similarly dated articles to understand the gist of the event. To counteract the lack of analysis on the parties involved, it is essential to come up with a novel framework to gauge the importance of stakeholders and the connection of related events through the relevant entities involved. Therefore, we present SUnSET: Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for the task of Timeline Summarization (TLS). We leverage powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) to build SET triplets and introduced the use of stakeholder-based ranking to construct a $Relevancy$ metric, which can be extended into general situations. Our experimental results outperform all prior baselines and emerged as the new State-of-the-Art, highlighting the impact of stakeholder information within news article."
2507.22254,"We study properties of opinion formation on Wikipedia Ising Networks. Each Wikipedia article is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of one article to another generating a directed network of a given language edition with millions of nodes. Ising spins are placed at each node and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized steady-state phase. This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process. The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of this Ising Network Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between political leaders, world countries and social concepts. This approach is also generalized to the competition between three groups of different opinions described by three colors, for example Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025. We argue that this approach provides a generic description of opinion formation in various complex networks."
2507.22589,"The increasing prominence of temporal networks in online social platforms and dynamic communication systems has made influence maximization a critical research area. Various diffusion models have been proposed to capture the spread of information, yet selecting the most suitable model for a given scenario remains challenging. This article provides a structured guide to making the best choice among diffusion models for influence maximization on temporal networks. We categorize existing models based on their underlying mechanisms and assess their effectiveness in different network settings. We analyze seed selection strategies, highlighting how the inherent properties of influence spread enable the development of efficient algorithms that can find near-optimal sets of influential nodes. By comparing key advancements, challenges, and practical applications, we offer a comprehensive roadmap for researchers and practitioners to navigate the landscape of temporal influence maximization effectively."
2507.22799,"Human mobility forms the backbone of contact patterns through which infectious diseases propagate, fundamentally shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of epidemics and pandemics. While traditional models are often based on the assumption that all individuals have the same probability of infecting every other individual in the population, a so-called random homogeneous mixing, they struggle to capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of real-world human interactions. Recent advancements in data-driven methodologies and computational capabilities have unlocked the potential of integrating high-resolution human mobility data into epidemic modeling, significantly improving the accuracy, timeliness, and applicability of epidemic risk assessment, contact tracing, and intervention strategies. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current landscape in human mobility-informed epidemic modeling. We explore diverse sources and representations of human mobility data, and then examine the behavioral and structural roles of mobility and contact in shaping disease transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the review spans a wide range of epidemic modeling approaches, ranging from classical compartmental models to network-based, agent-based, and machine learning models. And we also discuss how mobility integration enhances risk management and response strategies during epidemics. By synthesizing these insights, the review can serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, bridging the gap between epidemiological theory and the dynamic complexities of human interaction while charting clear directions for future research."
2507.22955,"Community detection in social network graphs plays a vital role in uncovering group dynamics, influence pathways, and the spread of information. Traditional methods focus primarily on graph structural properties, but recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) open up new avenues for integrating semantic and contextual information into this task. In this paper, we present a detailed investigation into how various LLM-based approaches perform in identifying communities within social graphs. We introduce a two-step framework called CommLLM, which leverages the GPT-4o model along with prompt-based reasoning to fuse language model outputs with graph structure. Evaluations are conducted on six real-world social network datasets, measuring performance using key metrics such as Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Variation of Information (VOI), and cluster purity. Our findings reveal that LLMs, particularly when guided by graph-aware strategies, can be successfully applied to community detection tasks in small to medium-sized graphs. We observe that the integration of instruction-tuned models and carefully engineered prompts significantly improves the accuracy and coherence of detected communities. These insights not only highlight the potential of LLMs in graph-based research but also underscore the importance of tailoring model interactions to the specific structure of graph data."
2507.23025,"In recent years, many large directed networks such as online social networks are collected with the help of powerful data engineering and data storage techniques. Analyses of such networks attract significant attention from both the academics and industries. However, analyses of large directed networks are often time-consuming and expensive because the complexities of a lot of graph algorithms are often polynomial with the size of the graph. Hence, sampling algorithms that can generate graphs preserving properties of original graph are of great importance because they can speed up the analysis process. We propose a promising framework to sample directed graphs: Construct a sample graph with linearly rescaled Joint Degree Matrix (JDM) and Degree Correlation Matrix (DCM). Previous work shows that graphs with the same JDM and DCM will have a range of very similar graph properties. We also conduct experiments on real-world datasets to show that the numbers of non-zero entries in JDM and DCM are quite small compared to the number of edges and nodes. Adopting this framework, we propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that can provably preserves in-degree and out-degree distributions, which are two most fundamental properties of a graph. We also prove the upper bound for deviations in the joint degree distribution and degree correlation distribution, which correspond to JDM and DCM. Besides, we prove that the deviations in these distributions are negatively correlated with the sparsity of the JDM and DCM. Considering that these two matrices are always quite sparse, we believe that proposed algorithm will have a better-than-theory performance on real-world large directed networks."
2507.23148,"To mitigate the adverse effects of low-quality or false information, studies have shown the effectiveness of various intervention techniques through debunking or so-called pre-bunking. However, the effectiveness of such interventions can decay. Here, we investigate the role of the detailed social structure of the local villages within which the intervened individuals live, which provides opportunities for the targeted individuals to discuss and internalize new knowledge. We evaluated this with respect to a critically important topic, information about maternal and child health care, delivered via a 22-month in-home intervention. Specifically, we examined the effect of having friendship ties on the retention of knowledge interventions among targeted individuals in 110 isolated Honduran villages. We hypothesize that individuals who receive specific knowledge can internalize and consolidate this information by engaging in social interactions where, for instance, they have an opportunity to discuss it with others in the process. The opportunity to explain information to others (knowledge sharing) promotes deeper cognitive processing and elaborative encoding, which ultimately enhances memory retention. We found that well-connected individuals within a social network experience an enhanced effectiveness of knowledge interventions. These individuals may be more likely to internalize and retain the information and reinforce it in others, due to increased opportunities for social interaction where they teach others or learn from them, a mechanism we refer to as ""social boosting"". These findings underscore the role of social interactions in reinforcing health knowledge interventions over the long term. We believe these findings would be of interest to the health policy, the global health workforce, and healthcare professionals focusing on disadvantaged populations and UN missions on infodemics."

2507.23699,"This study investigates the presence of left-wing extremism on thethis http URLinstance of the decentralized social media platform Lemmy, from its launch in 2019 up to a month after the bans of the subreddits r/GenZedong and r/GenZhou. We conduct a temporal analysis onthis http URL's user activity, with also measuring the degree of highly abusive or hateful content. Furthermore, we explore the content of their posts using a transformer-based topic modeling approach. Our findings reveal a substantial increase in user activity and toxicity levels following the migration of these subreddits tothis http URL. We also identify posts that support authoritarian regimes, endorse the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and feature anti-Zionist and antisemitic content. Overall, our findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of political extremism within decentralized social networks and emphasize the necessity of analyzing both ends of the political spectrum in research."
2508.00497,"Public response prediction is critical for understanding how individuals or groups might react to specific events, policies, or social phenomena, making it highly valuable for crisis management, policy-making, and social media analysis. However, existing works face notable limitations. First, they lack micro-level personalization, producing generic responses that ignore individual user preferences. Moreover, they overlook macro-level sentiment distribution and only deal with individual-level sentiment, constraining them from analyzing broader societal trends and group sentiment dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose SocialAlign, a unified framework that predicts real-world responses at both micro and macro levels in social contexts. At the micro level, SocialAlign employs SocialLLM with an articulate Personalized Analyze-Compose LoRA (PAC-LoRA) structure, which deploys specialized expert modules for content analysis and response generation across diverse topics and user profiles, enabling the generation of personalized comments with corresponding sentiments. At the macro level, it models group sentiment distributions and aligns predictions with real-world sentiment trends derived from social media data. To evaluate SocialAlign in real-world scenarios, we introduce SentiWeibo, a large-scale dataset curated from authentic social interactions on the Weibo platform. Experimental results on our SentiWeibo and related LaMP benchmark demonstrate that SocialAlign surpasses strong baselines, showing improved accuracy, interpretability, and generalization in public response prediction. We hope our work inspires further research in public response prediction and computational social science:this https URL."
2508.00893,"In this paper, we consider the soft geometric block model (SGBM) with a fixed number $k \geq 2$ of homogeneous communities in the dense regime, and we introduce a spectral clustering algorithm for community recovery on graphs generated by this model. Given such a graph, the algorithm produces an embedding into $\mathbb{R}^{k-1}$ using the eigenvectors associated with the $k-1$ eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph that are closest to a value determined by the parameters of the model. It then applies $k$-means clustering to the embedding. We prove weak consistency and show that a simple local refinement step ensures strong consistency. A key ingredient is an application of a non-standard version of Davis-Kahan theorem to control eigenspace perturbations when eigenvalues are not simple. We also analyze the limiting spectrum of the adjacency matrix, using a combination of combinatorial and matrix techniques."
2508.00927,"Overlapping community detection (OCD) is a fundamental graph data analysis task for extracting graph patterns. Traditional OCD methods can be broadly divided into node clustering and link clustering approaches, both of which rely solely on link information to identify overlapping communities. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have made significant advancements for this task. However, existing GNN-based approaches often face difficulties in effectively integrating link, attribute, and prior information, along with challenges like limited receptive fields and over-smoothing, which hinder their performance on complex overlapping community detection. In this paper, we propose a Weak-clique based Overlapping Community Detection method, namely WOCD, which incorporates prior information and optimizes the use of link information to improve detection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce pseudo-labels within a semi-supervised framework to strengthen the generalization ability, making WOCD more versatile. Furthermore, we initialize pseudo-labels using weak cliques to fully leverage link and prior information, leading to better detection accuracy. Additionally, we employ a single-layer Graph Transformer combined with GNN, which achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining efficiency. We evaluate WOCD on eight real-world attributed datasets, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised OCD method by a significant margin in terms of accuracy."
2508.00975,"Social network motifs are recurring patterns of small subgraphs that indicate fundamental patterns of social communication. In this work, we study the simple star network motifs that recur on X during the COVID-19 discourse. We study the profile of the manifestation of the star network among bot and human users. There are six primary patterns of the star motif, differentiating by the bots and humans being either egos and alters. We describe the presentation of each of these six patterns in our data, demonstrating how the motif patterns can inform social media behavioral analysis."
2508.00998,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more sophisticated, there is a possibility to harness LLMs to power social media bots. This work investigates the realism of generating LLM-Powered social media bot networks. Through a combination of manual effort, network science and LLMs, we create synthetic bot agent personas, their tweets and their interactions, thereby simulating social media networks. We compare the generated networks against empirical bot/human data, observing that both network and linguistic properties of LLM-Powered Bots differ from Wild Bots/Humans. This has implications towards the detection and effectiveness of LLM-Powered Bots."
2508.01124,"As a countermeasure against misinformation that undermines the healthy use of social media, a preventive intervention known as \textit{prebunking} has recently attracted attention in the field of psychology. Prebunking aims to strengthen individuals' cognitive resistance to misinformation by presenting weakened doses of misinformation or by teaching common manipulation techniques before they encounter actual misinformation. Despite the growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness in reducing susceptibility to misinformation at the individual level, an important open question remains: how best to identify the optimal targets for prebunking interventions to mitigate the spread of misinformation in a social network. To address this issue, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem, called the \textit{network prebunking problem}, which aims to select optimal prebunking targets that minimizes the spread of misinformation in a social network under limited intervention budgets. We show that the problem is NP-hard and that its objective function is monotone and submodular, which provides a theoretical foundation for approximation guarantees of greedy algorithms. However, since the greedy algorithm is computationally expensive and does not scale to large networks, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm, MIA-NPP, based on the Maximum Influence Arborescence (MIA) approach, which restricts influence propagation around each node to a local directed tree rooted at that node. Through numerical experiments using real-world social network datasets, we demonstrate that MIA-NPP effectively suppresses the spread of misinformation under both fully observed and uncertain model parameter settings."
2508.01125,"Journalists have incorporated social networks into their work as a standard tool, enhancing their ability to produce and disseminate information and making it easier for them to connect more directly with their audiences. However, this greater presence in the digital public sphere has also increased their exposure to harassment and hate speech, particularly in the case of women journalists. This study analyzes the presence of harassment and hate speech in responses (n = 60,684) to messages that 200 journalists and media outlets posted on X (formerly Twitter) accounts during the days immediately preceding and following the July 23 (23-J) general elections held in Spain in 2023. The results indicate that the most common forms of harassment were insults and political hate, which were more frequently aimed at personal accounts than institutional ones, highlighting the significant role of political polarization-particularly during election periods-in shaping the hostility that journalists face. Moreover, although, generally speaking, the total number of harassing messages was similar for men and women, it was found that a greater number of sexist messages were aimed at women journalists, and an ideological dimension was identified in the hate speech that extremists or right-wing populists directed at them. This study corroborates that this is a minor but systemic issue, particularly from a political and gender perspective. To counteract this, the media must develop proactive policies and protective actions extending even to the individual level, where this issue usually applies."
2508.01244,"Community search is a widely studied semi-supervised graph clustering problem, retrieving a high-quality connected subgraph containing the user-specified query vertex. However, existing methods primarily focus on cohesiveness within the community but ignore the sparsity outside the community, obtaining sub-par results. Inspired by this, we adopt the well-known conductance metric to measure the quality of a community and introduce a novel problem of conductance-based community search (CCS). CCS aims at finding a subgraph with the smallest conductance among all connected subgraphs that contain the query vertex. We prove that the CCS problem is NP-hard. To efficiently query CCS, a four-stage subgraph-conductance-based community search algorithm, SCCS, is proposed. Specifically, we first greatly reduce the entire graph using local sampling techniques. Then, a three-stage local optimization strategy is employed to continuously refine the community quality. Namely, we first utilize a seeding strategy to obtain an initial community to enhance its internal cohesiveness. Then, we iteratively add qualified vertices in the expansion stage to guarantee the internal cohesiveness and external sparsity of the community. Finally, we gradually remove unqualified vertices during the verification stage. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets containing one billion-scale graph and synthetic datasets show the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our solutions."
2508.01278,"Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is of great importance, and has many applications in practice. For example, finding influential nodes in e-commerce network can provide merchants with customers with strong purchase intent; identifying influential nodes in computer information system can help locating the components that cause the system break down and identifying influential nodes in these networks can accelerate the flow of information in networks. Thus, a lot of efforts have been made on the problem of indentifying influential nodes. However, previous efforts either consider only one aspect of the network structure, or using global centralities with high time consuming as node features to identify influential nodes, and the existing methods do not consider the relationships between different centralities. To solve these problems, we propose a Graph Convolutional Network Framework based on Feature Network, abbreviated as FNGCN (graph convolutional network is abbreviated as GCN in the following text). Further, to exclude noises and reduce redundency, FNGCN utilizes feature network to represent the complicated relationships among the local centralities, based on which the most suitable local centralities are determined. By taking a shallow GCN and a deep GCN into the FNGCN framework, two FNGCNs are developed. With ground truth obtained from the widely used Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model, the two FNGCNs are compared with the state-of-art methods on several real-world networks. Experimental results show that the two FNGCNs can identify the influential nodes more accurately than the compared methods, indicating that the proposed framework is effective in identifying influential nodes in complex networks."
2508.01398,"What has been the impact of the enormous amounts of time, effort and money spent promoting pro-vaccine science from pre-COVID-19 to now? We answer this using a unique mapping of online competition between pro- and anti-vaccination views among ~100M Facebook Page members, tracking 1,356 interconnected communities through platform interventions. Remarkably, the network's fundamental architecture shows no change: the isolation of established expertise and the symbiosis of anti and mainstream neutral communities persist. This means that even if the same time, effort and money continue to be spent, nothing will likely change. The reason for this resilience lies in ""glocal"" evolution: Communities blend multiple topics while bridging neighborhood-level to international scales, creating redundant pathways that transcend categorical targeting. The solution going forward is to focus on the system's network. We show how network engineering approaches can achieve opinion moderation without content removal, representing a paradigm shift from suppression towards structural interventions."
2508.01485,"Social networks, characterized by community structures, often rely on nodes called structural hole spanners to facilitate inter-community information dissemination. However, the dynamic nature of these networks, where spanner nodes may be removed, necessitates resilient methods to maintain inter-community communication. To this end, we introduce robust spanners (RS) as nodes uniquely equipped to bridge communities despite disruptions, such as node or edge removals. We propose a novel scoring technique to identify RS nodes and present a parallel algorithm with a CUDA implementation for efficient RS detection in large networks. Empirical analysis of real-world social networks reveals that high-scoring nodes exhibit a spanning capacity comparable to those identified by benchmark spanner detection algorithms while offering superior robustness. Our implementation on Nvidia GPUs achieves an average speedup of 244X over traditional spanner detection techniques, demonstrating its efficacy to identify RS in large social networks."
2508.01552,"The battlefield of information warfare has moved to online social networks, where influence campaigns operate at unprecedented speed and scale. As with any strategic domain, success requires understanding the terrain, modeling adversaries, and executing interventions. This tutorial introduces a formal optimization framework for social media information operations (IO), where the objective is to shape opinions through targeted actions. This framework is parameterized by quantities such as network structure, user opinions, and activity levels - all of which must be estimated or inferred from data. We discuss analytic tools that support this process, including centrality measures for identifying influential users, clustering algorithms for detecting community structure, and sentiment analysis for gauging public opinion. These tools either feed directly into the optimization pipeline or help defense analysts interpret the information environment. With the landscape mapped, we highlight threats such as coordinated bot networks, extremist recruitment, and viral misinformation. Countermeasures range from content-level interventions to mathematically optimized influence strategies. Finally, the emergence of generative AI transforms both offense and defense, democratizing persuasive capabilities while enabling scalable defenses. This shift calls for algorithmic innovation, policy reform, and ethical vigilance to protect the integrity of our digital public sphere."
2508.02089,"This study investigates how social media sentiment derived from Reddit comments can be used to enhance investment decisions in a way that offers higher returns with lower risk. Using BERTweet we analyzed over 2 million Reddit comments from the subreddit r/wallstreetbets and developed a Sentiment Volume Change (SVC) metric combining sentiment and comment volume changes, which showed significantly improved correlation with next-day returns compared to sentiment alone. We then implemented two different investment strategies that relied solely on SVC to make decisions. Back testing these strategies over four years (2020-2023) our strategies significantly outperformed a comparable buy-and-hold (B&H) strategy in a bull market, achieving 70% higher returns in 2023 and 84.4% higher returns in 2021 while also mitigating losses by 4% in a declining market in 2022. Our results confirm that comment sentiment and volume data derived from Reddit can be effective in predicting short-term stock price movements and sentiment-powered strategies can offer superior risk-adjusted returns as compared to the market, implying that social media sentiment can potentially be a valuable investment tool."
2508.03385,"Social media platforms have been widely linked to societal harms, including rising polarization and the erosion of constructive debate. Can these problems be mitigated through prosocial interventions? We address this question using a novel method - generative social simulation - that embeds Large Language Models within Agent-Based Models to create socially rich synthetic platforms. We create a minimal platform where agents can post, repost, and follow others. We find that the resulting following-networks reproduce three well-documented dysfunctions: (1) partisan echo chambers; (2) concentrated influence among a small elite; and (3) the amplification of polarized voices - creating a 'social media prism' that distorts political discourse. We test six proposed interventions, from chronological feeds to bridging algorithms, finding only modest improvements - and in some cases, worsened outcomes. These results suggest that core dysfunctions may be rooted in the feedback between reactive engagement and network growth, raising the possibility that meaningful reform will require rethinking the foundational dynamics of platform architecture."
2508.03599,"This paper examines the role of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) on Twitter regarding the Russo-Ukrainian war, distinguishing between genuine OSINT and deceptive misinformation efforts, termed ""BULLSHINT."" Utilizing a dataset spanning from January 2022 to July 2023, we analyze nearly 2 million tweets from approximately 1,040 users involved in discussing real-time military engagements, strategic analyses, and misinformation related to the conflict. Using sentiment analysis, partisanship detection, misinformation identification, and Named Entity Recognition (NER), we uncover communicative patterns and dissemination strategies within the OSINT community. Significant findings reveal a predominant negative sentiment influenced by war events, a nuanced distribution of pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian partisanship, and the potential strategic manipulation of information. Additionally, we apply community detection techniques, which are able to identify distinct clusters partisanship, topics, and misinformation, highlighting the complex dynamics of information spread on social media. This research contributes to the understanding of digital warfare and misinformation dynamics, offering insights into the operationalization of OSINT in geopolitical conflicts."
2508.03747,"Human mobility regularity is crucial for understanding urban dynamics and informing decision-making processes. This study first quantifies the periodicity in complex human mobility data as a sparse identification of dominant positive auto-correlations in time series autoregression and then discovers periodic patterns. We apply the framework to large-scale metro passenger flow data in Hangzhou, China and multi-modal mobility data in New York City and Chicago, USA, revealing the interpretable weekly periodicity across different spatial locations over past several years. The analysis of ridesharing data from 2019 to 2024 demonstrates the disruptive impact of the pandemic on mobility regularity and the subsequent recovery trends. In 2024, the periodic mobility patterns of ridesharing, taxi, subway, and bikesharing in Manhattan uncover the regularity and variability of these travel modes. Our findings highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning to discover spatiotemporal mobility patterns and offer a valuable tool for understanding urban systems."
2508.03843,"A relevant, sometimes overlooked, quality criterion for communities in graphs is that they should be well-connected in addition to being edge-dense. Prior work has shown that leading community detection methods can produce poorly-connected communities, and some even produce internally disconnected communities. A recent study by Park et al. in Complex Networks and their Applications 2024 showed that this problem is evident in clusterings from three Stochastic Block Models (SBMs) in graph-tool, a popular software package. To address this issue, Park et al. presented a simple technique, Well-Connected Clusters (WCC), that repeatedly finds and removes small edge cuts of size at most $\log_{10}n$ in clusters, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the cluster, and showed that treatment of graph-tool SBM clusterings with WCC improves accuracy. Here we examine the question of cluster connectivity for clusterings computed using other SBM software or nested SBMs within graph-tool. Our study, using a wide range of real-world and synthetic networks, shows that all tested SBM clustering methods produce communities that are disconnected, and that graph-tool improves on PySBM. We provide insight into why graph-tool degree-corrected SBM clustering produces disconnected clusters by examining the description length formula it uses, and explore the impact of modifications to the description length formula. Finally, we show that WCC provides an improvement in accuracy for both flat and nested SBMs and establish that it scales to networks with millions of nodes."
2508.04034,"Identifying meaningful structure across multiple scales remains a central challenge in network science. We introduce Hierarchical Clustering Entropy (HCE), a general and model-agnostic framework for detecting informative levels in hierarchical community structures. Unlike existing approaches, HCE operates directly on dendrograms without relying on edge-level statistics. It selects resolution levels that maximize a principled trade-off between the entropy of the community size distribution and the number of communities, corresponding to scales of high structural heterogeneity. This criterion applies to dendrograms produced by a wide range of clustering algorithms and distance metrics, including modularity-based and correlation-based methods. We evaluate HCE on synthetic benchmarks with varying degrees of hierarchy, size imbalance, and noise, including LFR and both symmetric and asymmetric multiscale models, and show that it consistently identifies partitions closely aligned with ground truth. Applied to real-world networks in social and neuroscience systems, HCE reveals interpretable modular hierarchies that align with known structural and functional organizations. As a scalable and principled method, HCE offers a general, domain-independent approach to hierarchical community detection with potential applications across biological, social, and technological systems."
2508.04174,"Discovering quasi-cliques -- subgraphs whose edge density exceeds a given threshold -- is a fundamental task in graph mining with applications to web spam detection, fraud screening, and e-commerce recommendation. However, existing methods for quasi-clique discovery on large-scale web graphs are often sensitive to random seeds or lack of explicit edge-density guarantees, making the task challenging in practice. This paper presents EDQC, an energy diffusion-based method for quasi-clique discovery. EDQC first employs an adaptive energy diffusion process to generate an energy ranking that highlights structurally cohesive regions. Guided by this energy ranking, the algorithm identifies a high-quality subgraph by minimizing conductance, a standard measure from community detection. This subgraph is then refined to meet the specified density threshold. Extensive experiments on 75 real-world graphs show that EDQC finds larger quasi-cliques on most datasets, with consistently lower variance across runs and competitive runtime. To the best of our knowledge, EDQC is the first method to incorporate energy diffusion into quasi-clique discovery."
2508.04187,"The concept of the mutual influence that awareness and disease may exert on each other has recently presented significant challenges. The actions individuals take to prevent contracting a disease and their level of awareness can profoundly affect the dynamics of its spread. Simultaneously, disease outbreaks impact how people become aware. In response, we initially propose a null model that couples two Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) dynamics and analyze it using a mean-field approach. Subsequently, we explore the parameter space to quantify the effects of this mutual influence on various observables. Finally, based on this null model, we conduct an empirical analysis of Twitter data related to COVID-19 and confirmed cases within American states. Our findings indicate that in specific regions of the parameter space, it is possible to suppress the epidemic by increasing awareness, and we investigate phase transitions. Furthermore, our model demonstrates the ability to alter the dominant population group by adjusting parameters throughout the course of the outbreak. Additionally, using the model, we assign a set of parameters to each state, revealing that these parameters change at different pandemic peaks. Notably, a robust correlation emerges between the ranking of states' Twitter activity, as gathered from empirical data, and the immunity parameters assigned to each state using our model. This observation underscores the pivotal role of sustained awareness transitioning from the initial to the subsequent peaks in the disease progression."
2508.04252,"With the development of social media, rumors spread quickly, cause great harm to society and economy. Thereby, many effective rumor detection methods have been developed, among which the rumor propagation structure learning based methods are particularly effective compared to other methods. However, the existing methods still suffer from many issues including the difficulty to obtain large-scale labeled rumor datasets, which leads to the low generalization ability and the performance degeneration on new events since rumors are time-critical and usually appear with hot topics or newly emergent events. In order to solve the above problems, in this study, we used large-scale unlabeled topic datasets crawled from the social media platform Weibo and Twitter with claim propagation structure to improve the semantic learning ability of a graph reprentation learing model on various topics. We use three typical graph self-supervised methods, InfoGraph, JOAO and GraphMAE in two commonly used training strategies, to verify the performance of general graph semi-supervised methods in rumor detection tasks. In addition, for alleviating the time and topic difference between unlabeled topic data and rumor data, we also collected a rumor dataset covering a variety of topics over a decade (10-year ago from 2022) from the Weibo rumor-refuting platform. Our experiments show that these general graph self-supervised learning methods outperform previous methods specifically designed for rumor detection tasks and achieve good performance under few-shot conditions, demonstrating the better generalization ability with the help of our massive unlabeled topic dataset."
2508.04608,"The assortative behavior of a network is the tendency of similar (or dissimilar) nodes to connect to each other. This tendency can have an influence on various properties of the network, such as its robustness or the dynamics of spreading processes. In this paper, we study degree assortativity both in real-world networks and in several generative models for networks with heavy-tailed degree distribution based on latent spaces. In particular, we study Chung-Lu Graphs and Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs).Previous research on assortativity has primarily focused on measuring the degree assortativity in real-world networks using the Pearson assortativity coefficient, despite reservations against this coefficient. We rigorously confirm these reservations by mathematically proving that the Pearson assortativity coefficient does not measure assortativity in any network with sufficiently heavy-tailed degree distributions, which is typical for real-world networks. Moreover, we find that other single-valued assortativity coefficients also do not sufficiently capture the wiring preferences of nodes, which often vary greatly by node degree. We therefore take a more fine-grained approach, analyzing a wide range of conditional and joint weight and degree distributions of connected nodes, both numerically in real-world networks and mathematically in the generative graph models. We provide several methods of visualizing the results.We show that the generative models are assortativity-neutral, while many real-world networks are not. Therefore, we also propose an extension of the GIRG model which retains the manifold desirable properties induced by the degree distribution and the latent space, but also exhibits tunable assortativity. We analyze the resulting model mathematically, and give a fine-grained quantification of its assortativity."
2508.04694,"Analyzing the structure and function of urban transportation networks is critical for enhancing mobility, equity, and resilience. This paper leverages network science to conduct a multi-modal analysis of San Diego's transportation system. We construct a multi-layer graph using data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS), representing driving, walking, and public transit layers. By integrating thousands of Points of Interest (POIs), we analyze network accessibility, structure, and resilience through centrality measures, community detection, and a proposed metric for walkability.Our analysis reveals a system defined by a stark core-periphery divide. We find that while the urban core is well-integrated, 30.3% of POIs are isolated from public transit within a walkable distance, indicating significant equity gaps in suburban and rural access. Centrality analysis highlights the driving network's over-reliance on critical freeways as bottlenecks, suggesting low network resilience, while confirming that San Diego is not a broadly walkable city. Furthermore, community detection demonstrates that transportation mode dictates the scale of mobility, producing compact, local clusters for walking and broad, regional clusters for driving. Collectively, this work provides a comprehensive framework for diagnosing urban mobility systems, offering quantitative insights that can inform targeted interventions to improve transportation equity and infrastructure resilience in San Diego."
2508.04889,"Most social applications, from Twitter to Wikipedia, have rigid one-size-fits-all designs, but building new social applications is both technically challenging and results in applications that are siloed away from existing communities. We present Graffiti, a system that can be used to build a wide variety of personalized social applications with relative ease that also interoperate with each other. People can freely move between a plurality of designs -- each with its own aesthetic, feature set, and moderation -- all without losing their friends or data.Our concept of total reification makes it possible for seemingly contradictory designs, including conflicting moderation rules, to interoperate. Conversely, our concept of channels prevents interoperation from occurring by accident, avoiding context collapse.Graffiti applications interact through a minimal client-side API, which we show admits at least two decentralized implementations. Above the API, we built a Vue plugin, which we use to develop applications similar to Twitter, Messenger, and Wikipedia using only client-side code. Our case studies explore how these and other novel applications interoperate, as well as the broader ecosystem that Graffiti enables."
2508.05107,"Social recommendation, which seeks to leverage social ties among users to alleviate the sparsity issue of user-item interactions, has emerged as a popular technique for elevating personalized services in recommender systems. Despite being effective, existing social recommendation models are mainly devised for recommending regular items such as blogs, images, and products, and largely fail for community recommendations due to overlooking the unique characteristics of communities. Distinctly, communities are constituted by individuals, who present high dynamicity and relate to rich structural patterns in social networks. To our knowledge, limited research has been devoted to comprehensively exploiting this information for recommending communities.To bridge this gap, this paper presents CASO, a novel and effective model specially designed for social community recommendation. Under the hood, CASO harnesses three carefully-crafted encoders for user embedding, wherein two of them extract community-related global and local structures from the social network via social modularity maximization and social closeness aggregation, while the third one captures user preferences using collaborative filtering with observed user-community affiliations. To further eliminate feature redundancy therein, we introduce a mutual exclusion between social and collaborative signals. Finally, CASO includes a community detection loss in the model optimization, thereby producing community-aware embeddings for communities. Our extensive experiments evaluating CASO against nine strong baselines on six real-world social networks demonstrate its consistent and remarkable superiority over the state of the art in terms of community recommendation performance."
2508.05488,"A multiplex social network captures multiple types of social relations among the same set of people, with each layer representing a distinct type of relationship. Understanding the structure of such systems allows us to identify how social exchanges may be driven by a person's own attributes and actions (independence), the status or resources of others (dependence), and mutual influence between entities (interdependence). Characterizing structure in multiplex networks is challenging, as the distinct layers can reflect different yet complementary roles, with interdependence emerging across multiple scales. Here, we introduce the Multiplex Latent Trade-off Model (MLT), a framework for extracting roles in multiplex social networks that accounts for independence, dependence, and interdependence. MLT defines roles as trade-offs, requiring each node to distribute its source and target roles across layers while simultaneously distributing community memberships within hierarchical, multi-scale structures. Applying the MLT approach to 176 real-world multiplex networks, composed of social, health, and economic layers, from villages in western Honduras, we see core social exchange principles emerging, while also revealing local, layer-specific, and multi-scale communities. Link prediction analyses reveal that modeling interdependence yields the greatest performance gains in the social layer, with subtler effects in health and economic layers. This suggests that social ties are structurally embedded, whereas health and economic ties are primarily shaped by individual status and behavioral engagement. Our findings offer new insights into the structure of human social systems."
2508.06655,"Dense subgraph mining is a fundamental technique in graph mining, commonly applied in fraud detection, community detection, product recommendation, and document summarization. In such applications, we are often interested in identifying communities, recommendations, or summaries that reflect different constituencies, styles or genres, and points of view. For this task, we introduce a new variant of the Densest $k$-Subgraph (D$k$S) problem that incorporates the attribute values of vertices. The proposed Vertex-Attribute-Constrained Densest $k$-Subgraph (VAC-D$k$S) problem retains the NP-hardness and inapproximability properties of the classical D$k$S. Nevertheless, we prove that a suitable continuous relaxation of VAC-D$k$S is tight and can be efficiently tackled using a projection-free Frank--Wolfe algorithm. We also present an insightful analysis of the optimization landscape of the relaxed problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed formulation and algorithm, and its ability to scale up to large graphs. We further elucidate the properties of VAC-D$k$S versus classical D$k$S in a political network mining application, where VAC-D$k$S identifies a balanced and more meaningful set of politicians representing different ideological camps, in contrast to the classical D$k$S solution which is unbalanced and rather mundane."
2508.06811,"Many have observed that the development and deployment of generative machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models follow a distinctive pattern in which pre-trained models are adapted and fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. However, there is limited empirical work that examines the structure of these interactions. This paper analyzes 1.86 million models on Hugging Face, a leading peer production platform for model development. Our study of model family trees -- networks that connect fine-tuned models to their base or parent -- reveals sprawling fine-tuning lineages that vary widely in size and structure. Using an evolutionary biology lens to study ML models, we use model metadata and model cards to measure the genetic similarity and mutation of traits over model families. We find that models tend to exhibit a family resemblance, meaning their genetic markers and traits exhibit more overlap when they belong to the same model family. However, these similarities depart in certain ways from standard models of asexual reproduction, because mutations are fast and directed, such that two `sibling' models tend to exhibit more similarity than parent/child pairs. Further analysis of the directional drifts of these mutations reveals qualitative insights about the open machine learning ecosystem: Licenses counter-intuitively drift from restrictive, commercial licenses towards permissive or copyleft licenses, often in violation of upstream license's terms; models evolve from multi-lingual compatibility towards english-only compatibility; and model cards reduce in length and standardize by turning, more often, to templates and automatically generated text. Overall, this work takes a step toward an empirically grounded understanding of model fine-tuning and suggests that ecological models and methods can yield novel scientific insights."
2508.07201,"Rumor detection on social media has become increasingly important. Most existing graph-based models presume rumor propagation trees (RPTs) have deep structures and learn sequential stance features along branches. However, through statistical analysis on real-world datasets, we find RPTs exhibit wide structures, with most nodes being shallow 1-level replies. To focus learning on intensive substructures, we propose Rumor Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning (RAGCL) method with adaptive view augmentation guided by node centralities. We summarize three principles for RPT augmentation: 1) exempt root nodes, 2) retain deep reply nodes, 3) preserve lower-level nodes in deep sections. We employ node dropping, attribute masking and edge dropping with probabilities from centrality-based importance scores to generate views. A graph contrastive objective then learns robust rumor representations. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate RAGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our work reveals the wide-structure nature of RPTs and contributes an effective graph contrastive learning approach tailored for rumor detection through principled adaptive augmentation. The proposed principles and augmentation techniques can potentially benefit other applications involving tree-structured graphs."
2508.07205,"Current rumor detection methods based on propagation structure learning predominately treat rumor detection as a class-balanced classification task on limited labeled data. However, real-world social media data exhibits an imbalanced distribution with a minority of rumors among massive regular posts. To address the data scarcity and imbalance issues, we construct two large-scale conversation datasets from Weibo and Twitter and analyze the domain distributions. We find obvious differences between rumor and non-rumor distributions, with non-rumors mostly in entertainment domains while rumors concentrate in news, indicating the conformity of rumor detection to an anomaly detection paradigm. Correspondingly, we propose the Anomaly Detection framework with Graph Supervised Contrastive Learning (AD-GSCL). It heuristically treats unlabeled data as non-rumors and adapts graph contrastive learning for rumor detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate AD-GSCL's superiority under class-balanced, imbalanced, and few-shot conditions. Our findings provide valuable insights for real-world rumor detection featuring imbalanced data distributions."
2508.07264,"Multimodal classification requires robust integration of visual and textual signals, yet common fusion strategies are brittle and vulnerable to modality-specific noise. In this paper, we present \textsc{FLUID}-Flow-Latent Unified Integration via Token Distillation for Expert Specialization, a principled token-level pipeline that improves cross-modal robustness and scalability. \textsc{FLUID} contributes three core elements: (1) \emph{Q-transforms}, learnable query tokens that distill and retain salient token-level features from modality-specific backbones; (2) a two-stage fusion scheme that enforces cross-modal consistency via contrastive alignment and then performs adaptive, task-aware fusion through a gating mechanism and a \emph{Q-bottleneck} that selectively compresses information for downstream reasoning; and (3) a lightweight, load-balanced Mixture-of-Experts at prediction time that enables efficient specialization to diverse semantic patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{FLUID} attains \(91\%\) accuracy on the GLAMI-1M benchmark, significantly outperforming prior baselines and exhibiting strong resilience to label noise, long-tail class imbalance, and semantic heterogeneity. Targeted ablation studies corroborate both the individual and synergistic benefits of the proposed components, positioning \textsc{FLUID} as a scalable, noise-resilient solution for multimodal product classification."
2508.07489,"Using edge weights is essential for modeling real-world systems where links possess relevant information, and preserving this information in low-dimensional representations is relevant for classification and prediction tasks. This paper systematically investigates how different random walk strategies - traditional unweighted, strength-based, and fully weight-aware - keeps edge weight information when generating node embeddings. Using network models, real-world graphs, and networks subjected to low-weight edge removal, we measured the correlation between original edge weights and the similarity of node pairs in the embedding space generated by random walk strategies. Our results consistently showed that weight-aware random walks significantly outperform other strategies, achieving correlations above 0.90 in network models. However, performance in real-world networks was more heterogeneous, influenced by factors like topology and weight distribution. Our analysis also revealed that removing weak edges via thresholding can initially improve correlation by reducing noise, but excessive pruning degrades representation quality. Our findings suggest that simply using a weight-aware random walk is generally the best approach for preserving node weight information in embeddings, but it is not a universal solution."
2508.07579,"Hashtags serve as identity markers and connection tools in online queer communities. Recently, the Western-origin #wlw (women-loving-women) hashtag has risen in the Chinese lesbian community on RedNote, coinciding with user migration triggered by the temporary US TikTok ban. This event provides a unique lens to study cross-cultural hashtag ingress and diffusion through the populations' responsive behaviors in cyber-migration. In this paper, we conducted a two-phase content analysis of 418 #wlw posts from January and April, examining different usage patterns during the hashtag's ingress and diffusion. Results indicate that the successful introduction of #wlw was facilitated by TikTok immigrants' bold importation, both populations' mutual interpretation, and RedNote natives' discussions. In current manifestation of diffusion, #wlw becomes a RedNote-recognized queer hashtag for sharing queer life, and semantically expands to support feminism discourse. Our findings provide empirical insights for enhancing the marginalized communities' cross-cultural communication."
2508.07845,"Misinformation is a growing concern in a decade involving critical global events. While social media regulation is mainly dedicated towards the detection and prevention of fake news and political misinformation, there is limited research about religious misinformation which has only been addressed through qualitative approaches. In this work, we study the spread of fabricated quotes (Hadith) that are claimed to belong to Prophet Muhammad (the prophet of Islam) as a case study demonstrating one of the most common religious misinformation forms on Arabic social media. We attempt through quantitative methods to understand the characteristics of social media users who interact with fabricated Hadith. We spotted users who frequently circulate fabricated Hadith and others who frequently debunk it to understand the main differences between the two groups. We used Logistic Regression to automatically predict their behaviors and analyzed its weights to gain insights about the characteristics and interests of each group. We find that both fabricated Hadith circulators and debunkers have generally a lot of ties to religious accounts. However, circulators are identified by many accounts that follow the Shia branch of Islam, Sunni Islamic public figures from the gulf countries, and many Sunni non-professional pages posting Islamic content. On the other hand, debunkers are identified by following academic Islamic scholars from multiple countries and by having more intellectual non-religious interests like charity, politics, and activism."
2508.08596,"Sense of Community (SOC) is vital to individual and collective well-being. Although social interactions have moved increasingly online, still little is known about the specific relationships between the nature of these interactions and Sense of Virtual Community (SOVC). This study addresses this gap by exploring how conversational structure and linguistic style predict SOVC in online communities, using a large-scale survey of 2,826 Reddit users across 281 varied subreddits. We develop a hierarchical model to predict self-reported SOVC based on automatically quantifiable and highly generalizable features that are agnostic to community topic and that describe both individual users and entire communities. We identify specific interaction patterns (e.g., reciprocal reply chains, use of prosocial language) associated with stronger communities and identify three primary dimensions of SOVC within Reddit -- Membership & Belonging, Cooperation & Shared Values, and Connection & Influence. This study provides the first quantitative evidence linking patterns of social interaction to SOVC and highlights actionable strategies for fostering stronger community attachment, using an approach that can generalize readily across community topics, languages, and platforms. These insights offer theoretical implications for the study of online communities and practical suggestions for the design of features to help more individuals experience the positive benefits of online community participation."
2508.08807,"An attributed hypergraph comprises nodes with attributes and hyperedges that connect varying numbers of nodes. Attributed hypergraph node and hyperedge embedding (AHNEE) maps nodes and hyperedges to compact vectors for use in important tasks such as node classification, hyperedge link prediction, and hyperedge classification. Generating high-quality embeddings is challenging due to the complexity of attributed hypergraphs and the need to embed both nodes and hyperedges, especially in large-scale data. Existing solutions often fall short by focusing only on nodes or lacking native support for attributed hypergraphs, leading to inferior quality, and struggle with scalability on large attributed hypergraphs.We propose SAHE, an efficient and effective approach that unifies node and hyperedge embeddings for AHNEE computation, advancing the state of the art via comprehensive embedding formulations and algorithmic designs. First, we introduce two higher-order similarity measures, HMS-N and HMS-E, to capture similarities between node pairs and hyperedge pairs, respectively. These measures consider multi-hop connections and global topology within an extended hypergraph that incorporates attribute-based hyperedges. SAHE formulates the AHNEE objective to jointly preserve all-pair HMS-N and HMS-N similarities. Direct optimization is computationally expensive, so we analyze and unify core approximations of all-pair HMS-N and HMS-N to solve them simultaneously. To enhance efficiency, we design several non-trivial optimizations that avoid iteratively materializing large dense matrices while maintaining high-quality results. Extensive experiments on diverse attributed hypergraphs and 3 downstream tasks, compared against 11 baselines, show that SAHE consistently outperforms existing methods in embedding quality and is up to orders of magnitude faster."
2508.08837,"The rise of LLMs poses new possibilities in modeling opinion evolution, a long-standing task in simulation, by leveraging advanced reasoning abilities to recreate complex, large-scale human cognitive trends. While most prior works focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens' perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale, long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural tolerance."
2508.09452,"A multi-view attributed graph (MVAG) G captures the diverse relationships and properties of real-world entities through multiple graph views and attribute views. Effectively utilizing all views in G is essential for MVAG clustering and embedding, which are important for applications like recommendation systems, anomaly detection, social network analysis, etc. Existing methods either achieve inferior result quality or incur significant computational costs to handle large-scale MVAGs.In this paper, we present a spectrum-guided Laplacian aggregation scheme with an effective objective formulation and two efficient algorithms SGLA and SGLA+, to cohesively integrate all views of G into an MVAG Laplacian matrix, which readily enables classic graph algorithms to handle G with superior performance in clustering and embedding tasks. We begin by conducting a theoretical analysis to design an integrated objective that consists of two components, the eigengap and connectivity objectives, aiming to link the spectral properties of the aggregated MVAG Laplacian with the underlying community and connectivity properties of G. A constrained optimization problem is then formulated for the integration, which is computationally expensive to solve. Thus, we first develop the SGLA algorithm, which already achieves excellent performance compared with existing methods. To further enhance efficiency, we design SGLA+ to reduce the number of costly objective evaluations via sampling and approximation to quickly find an approximate optimum. Extensive experiments compare our methods against 12 baselines for clustering and 8 baselines for embedding on 8 multi-view attributed graphs, validating the superior performance of SGLA and SGLA+ in terms of result quality and efficiency. Compared with the most effective baselines, our methods are significantly faster, often by up to orders of magnitude."
2508.09549,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks, yet their application to graph structure analysis, particularly in community search, remains underexplored. Community search, a fundamental task in graph analysis, aims to identify groups of nodes with dense interconnections, which is crucial for understanding the macroscopic structure of graphs. In this paper, we propose GraphCS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs in community search tasks. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs exhibit preliminary potential, they frequently fail to return meaningful results and suffer from output bias. To address these limitations, we introduce CS-Agent, a dual-agent collaborative framework to enhance LLM-based community search. CS-Agent leverages the complementary strengths of two LLMs acting as Solver and Validator. Through iterative feedback and refinement, CS-Agent dynamically refines initial results without fine-tuning or additional training. After the multi-round dialogue, Decider module selects the optimal community. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-Agent significantly improves the quality and stability of identified communities compared to baseline methods. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply LLMs to community search, bridging the gap between LLMs and graph analysis while providing a robust and adaptive solution for real-world applications."
2508.1004,"The global spread of misinformation and concerns about content trustworthiness have driven the development of automated fact-checking systems. Since false information often exploits social media dynamics such as ""likes"" and user networks to amplify its reach, effective solutions must go beyond content analysis to incorporate these factors. Moreover, simply labelling content as false can be ineffective or even reinforce biases such as automation and confirmation bias. This paper proposes an explainable framework that combines content, social media, and graph-based features to enhance fact-checking. It integrates a misinformation classifier with explainability techniques to deliver complete and interpretable insights supporting classification decisions. Experiments demonstrate that multimodal information improves performance over single modalities, with evaluations conducted on datasets in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Additionally, the framework's explanations were assessed for interpretability, trustworthiness, and robustness with a novel protocol, showing that it effectively generates human-understandable justifications for its predictions."
2508.10046,"Social media platforms have become valuable tools for understanding public health challenges by offering insights into patient behaviors, medication use, and mental health issues. However, analyzing such data remains difficult due to the prevalence of informal language, slang, and coded communication, which can obscure the detection of opioid misuse. This study addresses the issue of opioid-related user behavior on social media, including informal expressions, slang terms, and misspelled or coded language. We analyzed the existing Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) technique and developed a BERT-BiLSTM-3CNN hybrid deep learning model, named SABIA, to create a single-task classifier that effectively captures the features of the target dataset. The SABIA model demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing semantics and contextual information. The proposed approach includes: (1) data preprocessing, (2) data representation using the SABIA model, (3) a fine-tuning phase, and (4) classification of user behavior into five categories. A new dataset was constructed from Reddit posts, identifying opioid user behaviors across five classes: Dealers, Active Opioid Users, Recovered Users, Prescription Users, and Non-Users, supported by detailed annotation guidelines. Experiments were conducted using supervised learning. Results show that SABIA achieved benchmark performance, outperforming the baseline (Logistic Regression, LR = 0.86) and improving accuracy by 9.30%. Comparisons with seven previous studies confirmed its effectiveness and robustness. This study demonstrates the potential of hybrid deep learning models for detecting complex opioid-related behaviors on social media, supporting public health monitoring and intervention efforts."
2508.10289,"Identifying influential nodes is crucial in social network analysis. Existing methods often neglect local opinion leader tendencies, resulting in overlapping influence ranges for seed nodes. Furthermore, approaches based on vanilla graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle to effectively aggregate influence characteristics during message passing, particularly with varying influence intensities. Current techniques also fail to adequately address the multi-layer nature of social networks and node heterogeneity. To address these issues, this paper proposes Inf-MDE, a novel multi-layer influence maximization method leveraging differentiated graph embedding. Inf-MDE models social relationships using a multi-layer network structure. The model extracts a self-influence propagation subgraph to eliminate the representation bias between node embeddings and propagation dynamics. Additionally, Inf-MDE incorporates an adaptive local influence aggregation mechanism within its GNN design. This mechanism dynamically adjusts influence feature aggregation during message passing based on local context and influence intensity, enabling it to effectively capture both inter-layer propagation heterogeneity and intra-layer diffusion dynamics. Extensive experiments across four distinct multi-layer social network datasets demonstrate that Inf-MDE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
2508.10466,"Ideologically homogeneous online environments - often described as ""echo chambers"" or ""filter bubbles"" - are widely seen as drivers of polarization, radicalization, and misinformation. A central debate asks whether such homophily stems primarily from algorithmic curation or users' preference for like-minded peers. This study challenges that view by showing that homogeneity can emerge in the absence of both filtering algorithms and user preferences. Using an agent-based model inspired by Schelling's model of residential segregation, we demonstrate that weak individual preferences, combined with simple group-based interaction structures, can trigger feedback loops that drive communities toward segregation. Once a small imbalance forms, cascades of user exits and regrouping amplify homogeneity across the system. Counterintuitively, algorithmic filtering - often blamed for ""filter bubbles"" - can in fact sustain diversity by stabilizing mixed communities. These findings highlight online polarization as an emergent system-level dynamic and underscore the importance of applying a complexity lens to the study of digital public spheres."
2508.11516,"Recommender systems increasingly suffer from echo chambers and user homogenization, systemic distortions arising from the dynamic interplay between algorithmic recommendations and human behavior. While prior work has studied these phenomena through the lens of algorithmic bias or social network structure, we argue that the psychological mechanisms of users and the closed-loop interaction between users and recommenders are critical yet understudied drivers of these emergent effects. To bridge this gap, we propose the Confirmation-Aware Social Dynamic Model which incorporates user psychology and social relationships to simulate the actual user and recommender interaction process. Our theoretical analysis proves that echo chambers and homogenization traps, defined respectively as reduced recommendation diversity and homogenized user representations, will inevitably occur. We also conduct extensive empirical simulations on two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset with five well-designed metrics, exploring the root factors influencing the aforementioned phenomena from three level perspectives: the stochasticity and social integration degree of recommender (system-level), the psychological mechanisms of users (user-level), and the dataset scale (platform-level). Furthermore, we demonstrate four practical mitigation strategies that help alleviate echo chambers and user homogenization at the cost of some recommendation accuracy. Our findings provide both theoretical and empirical insights into the emergence and drivers of echo chambers and user homogenization, as well as actionable guidelines for human-centered recommender design."
2508.11863,"In several applications in distributed systems, an important design criterion is ensuring that the network is sparse, i.e., does not contain too many edges, while achieving reliable connectivity. Sparsity ensures communication overhead remains low, while reliable connectivity is tied to reliable communication and inference on decentralized data reservoirs and computational resources. A class of network models called random K-out graphs appear widely as a heuristic to balance connectivity and sparsity, especially in settings with limited trust, e.g., privacy-preserving aggregation of networked data in which networks are deployed. However, several questions remain regarding how to choose network parameters in response to different operational requirements, including the need to go beyond asymptotic results and the ability to model the stochastic and adversarial environments. To address this gap, we present theorems to inform the choice of network parameters that guarantee reliable connectivity in regimes where nodes can be finite or unreliable. We first derive upper and lower bounds for probability of connectivity in random K-out graphs when the number of nodes is finite. Next, we analyze the property of r-robustness, a stronger notion than connectivity that enables resilient consensus in the presence of malicious nodes. Finally, motivated by aggregation mechanisms based on pairwise masking, we model and analyze the impact of a subset of adversarial nodes, modeled as deletions, on connectivity and giant component size - metrics that are closely tied to privacy guarantees. Together, our results pave the way for end-to-end performance guarantees for a suite of algorithms for reliable inference on networks."
2508.11942,"We study the intricate relationships within healthcare systems, focusing on interactions among doctors, departments, and hospitals. Leveraging an evolutionary graph framework, the proposed model emphasizes both intra-layer and inter-layer trust relationships to better understand and optimize healthcare services. The trust-based network facilitates the identification of key healthcare entities by integrating their social and professional interactions, culminating in a trust-based algorithm that quantifies the importance of these entities. Validation with a real-world dataset reveals a strong correlation (0.91) between the proposed trust measures and the ratings of hospitals and departments, though doctor ratings demonstrate skewed distributions due to potential biases. By modeling these relationships and trust dynamics, the framework supports scalable healthcare infrastructure, enabling effective patient referrals, personalized recommendations, and enhanced decision-making pathways."
2508.12164,"Influence Maximization (IM) is a pivotal concept in social network analysis, involving the identification of influential nodes within a network to maximize the number of influenced nodes, and has a wide variety of applications that range from viral marketing and information dissemination to public health campaigns. IM can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem with a black-box objective function, where the goal is to select $B$ seed nodes that maximize the expected influence spread. Direct search methods, which do not require gradient information, are well-suited for such problems. Unlike gradient-based approaches, direct search algorithms, in fact, only evaluate the objective function at a suitably chosen set of trial points around the current solution to guide the search process. However, these methods often suffer from scalability issues due to the high cost of function evaluations, especially when applied to combinatorial problems like IM. This work, therefore, proposes the Network-aware Direct Search (NaDS) method, an innovative direct search approach that integrates the network structure into its neighborhood formulation and is used to tackle a mixed-integer programming formulation of the IM problem, the so-called General Information Propagation model. We tested our method on large-scale networks, comparing it to existing state-of-the-art approaches for the IM problem, including direct search methods and various greedy techniques and heuristics. The results of the experiments empirically confirm the assumptions underlying NaDS, demonstrating that exploiting the graph structure of the IM problem in the algorithmic framework can significantly improve its computational efficiency in the considered context."
2508.12186,"Despite the growing popularity of audio platforms, fact-checking spoken content remains significantly underdeveloped. Misinformation in speech often unfolds across multi-turn dialogues, shaped by speaker interactions, disfluencies, overlapping speech, and emotional tone-factors that complicate both claim detection and verification. Existing datasets fall short by focusing on isolated sentences or text transcripts, without modeling the conversational and acoustic complexity of spoken misinformation. We introduce MAD (Multi-turn Audio Dialogues), the first fact-checking dataset aligned with multi-turn spoken dialogues and corresponding audio. MAD captures how misinformation is introduced, contested, and reinforced through natural conversation. Each dialogue includes annotations for speaker turns, dialogue scenarios, information spread styles, sentence-level check-worthiness, and both sentence- and dialogue-level veracity. The dataset supports two core tasks: check-worthy claim detection and claim verification. Benchmarking shows that even strong pretrained models reach only 72-74% accuracy at the sentence level and 71-72% at the dialogue level in claim verification, underscoring MAD's difficulty. MAD offers a high-quality benchmark for advancing multimodal and conversational fact-checking, while also surfacing open challenges related to reasoning over speech and dialogue dynamics."
2508.1224,"Women's health in Bangladesh faces risks due to an alarming rise in cesarean section (CS) rates, exceeding 72% in hospital-based deliveries, far surpassing the WHO's recommended limit of 15%. This study, guided by the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), explored socio-cultural factors influencing childbirth mode decisions. Among 503 survey participants, 91% of CS cases occurred against initial preferences, revealing a disconnect between health beliefs and behavior. Subjective norms, particularly family influence and social expectations, emerged as more critical in shaping CS decisions than physician recommendations."
2508.12574,"With the development of social media networks, rumor detection models have attracted more and more attention. Whereas, these models primarily focus on classifying contexts as rumors or not, lacking the capability to locate and mark specific rumor content. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel rumor detection model named Insight Rumors to locate and mark rumor content within textual data. Specifically, we propose the Bidirectional Mamba2 Network with Dot-Product Attention (Att_BiMamba2), a network that constructs a bidirectional Mamba2 model and applies dot-product attention to weight and combine the outputs from both directions, thereby enhancing the representation of high-dimensional rumor features. Simultaneously, a Rumor Locating and Marking module is designed to locate and mark rumors. The module constructs a skip-connection network to project high-dimensional rumor features onto low-dimensional label features. Moreover, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is employed to impose strong constraints on the output label features, ensuring accurate rumor content location. Additionally, a labeled dataset for rumor locating and marking is constructed, with the effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated through comprehensive experiments. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed scheme not only detects rumors accurately but also locates and marks them in context precisely, outperforming state-of-the-art schemes that can only discriminate rumors roughly."
2508.13029,"This paper provides an empirical study of the Social Sphere Model for influence prediction, previously introduced by the authors, combining link prediction with top-k centrality-based selection. We apply the model to the temporal arXiv General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology collaboration network, evaluating its performance under varying edge sampling rates and prediction horizons to reflect different levels of initial data completeness and network evolution. Accuracy is assessed using mean squared error in both link prediction and influence maximization tasks. The results show that the model effectively identifies latent influencers, i.e., nodes that are not initially central but later influential, and performs best with denser initial graphs. Among the similarity measures tested, the newly introduced RA-2 metric consistently yields the lowest prediction errors. These findings support the practical applicability of the model to predict real-world influence in evolving networks."
2508.13295,"Social infrastructure plays a critical role in shaping neighborhood well-being by fostering social and cultural interaction, enabling service provision, and encouraging exposure to diverse environments. Despite the growing knowledge of its spatial accessibility, time use at social infrastructure places is underexplored due to the lack of a spatially resolved national dataset. We address this gap by developing scalable Social-Infrastructure Time Use measures (STU) that capture length and depth of engagement, activity diversity, and spatial inequality, supported by first-of-their-kind datasets spanning multiple geographic scales from census tracts to metropolitan areas. Our datasets leverage anonymized and aggregated foot traffic data collected between 2019 and 2024 across 49 continental U.S. states. The data description reveals variances in STU across time, space, and differing neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics. Validation demonstrates generally robust population representation, consistent with established national survey findings while revealing more nuanced patterns. Future analyses could link STU with public health outcomes and environmental factors to inform targeted interventions aimed at enhancing population well-being and guiding social infrastructure planning and usage."
2508.13375,"State and geopolitical censorship on Twitter, now X, has been turning into a routine, raising concerns about the boundaries between criminal content and freedom of speech. One such censorship practice, withholding content in a particular state has renewed attention due to Elon Musk's apparent willingness to comply with state demands. In this study, we present the first quantitative analysis of the impact of state censorship by withholding on social media using a dataset in which two prominent patterns emerged: Russian accounts censored in the EU for spreading state-sponsored narratives, and Turkish accounts blocked within Turkey for promoting militant propaganda. We find that censorship has little impact on posting frequency but significantly reduces likes and retweets by 25%, and follower growth by 90%-especially when the censored region aligns with the account's primary audience. Meanwhile, some Russian accounts continue to experience growth as their audience is outside the withholding jurisdictions. We develop a user-level binary classifier with a transformer backbone and temporal aggregation strategies, aiming to predict whether an account is likely to be withheld. Through an ablation study, we find that tweet content is the primary signal in predicting censorship, while tweet metadata and profile features contribute marginally. Our best model achieves an F1 score of 0.73 and an AUC of 0.83. This work informs debates on platform governance, free speech, and digital repression."
2508.13927,"The rapid and unregulated dissemination of information in the digital era has amplified the global ""infodemic,"" complicating the identification of high quality information. We present a lightweight, interpretable and non-invasive framework for assessing information quality based solely on diffusion dynamics, demonstrated here in the context of academic publications. Using a heterogeneous dataset of 29,264 sciences, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) and social science papers from ArnetMiner and OpenAlex, we model the diffusion network of each paper as a set of three theoretically motivated features: diversity, timeliness, and salience. A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) trained on these features achieved Pearson correlations of 0.834 for next-year citation gain and up to 95.62% accuracy in predicting high-impact papers. Feature relevance studies reveal timeliness and salience as the most robust predictors, while diversity offers less stable benefits in the academic setting but may be more informative in social media contexts. The framework's transparency, domain-agnostic design, and minimal feature requirements position it as a scalable tool for global information quality assessment, opening new avenues for moving beyond binary credibility labels toward richer, diffusion-informed evaluation metrics."
2508.14028,"Data sharing is the fuel of the galloping artificial intelligence economy, providing diverse datasets for training robust models. Trust between data providers and data consumers is widely considered one of the most important factors for enabling data sharing initiatives. Concerns about data sensitivity, privacy breaches, and misuse contribute to reluctance in sharing data across various domains. In recent years, there has been a rise in technological and algorithmic solutions to measure, capture and manage trust, trustworthiness, and reputation in what we collectively refer to as Trust and Reputation Management Systems (TRMSs). Such approaches have been developed and applied to different domains of computer science, such as autonomous vehicles, or IoT networks, but there have not been dedicated approaches to data sharing and its unique characteristics. In this survey, we examine TRMSs from a data-sharing perspective, analyzing how they assess the trustworthiness of both data and entities across different environments. We develop novel taxonomies for system designs, trust evaluation framework, and evaluation metrics for both data and entity, and we systematically analyze the applicability of existing TRMSs in data sharing. Finally, we identify open challenges and propose future research directions to enhance the explainability, comprehensiveness, and accuracy of TRMSs in large-scale data-sharing ecosystems."
2508.14092,"Graph-searching algorithms play a crucial role in various computational domains, enabling efficient exploration and pathfinding in structured data. Traditional approaches, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), follow rigid traversal patterns -- DFS explores branches exhaustively, while BFS expands level by level. In this paper, we propose the Hybrid Depth-Breadth Meaningful Search (HDBMS) algorithm, a novel graph traversal method that dynamically adapts its exploration strategy based on probabilistic node transitions. Unlike conventional methods, HDBMS prioritizes traversal paths by estimating the likelihood that a node contains the desired information, ensuring a more contextually relevant search. Through extensive experimentation on diverse directed graphs with varying structural properties, we demonstrate that HDBMS not only maintains competitive computational efficiency but also outperforms traditional algorithms in identifying meaningful paths. By integrating probabilistic decision-making, HDBMS constructs an adaptive and structured traversal order that balances exploration across depth and breadth, making it particularly effective in applications such as information retrieval, social network analysis, and recommendation systems. Our results highlight the robustness of HDBMS in scenarios where the most valuable connections emerge unpredictably, positioning it as a powerful alternative to traditional graph-searching techniques."
2508.14097,"Community detection in graphs aims to cluster nodes into meaningful groups, a task particularly challenging in heterophilic graphs, where nodes sharing similarities and membership to the same community are typically distantly connected. This is particularly evident when this task is tackled by graph neural networks, since they rely on an inherently local message passing scheme to learn the node representations that serve to cluster nodes into communities. In this work, we argue that the ability to propagate long-range information during message passing is key to effectively perform community detection in heterophilic graphs. To this end, we introduce the Unsupervised Antisymmetric Graph Neural Network (uAGNN), a novel unsupervised community detection approach leveraging non-dissipative dynamical systems to ensure stability and to propagate long-range information effectively. By employing antisymmetric weight matrices, uAGNN captures both local and global graph structures, overcoming the limitations posed by heterophilic scenarios. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate uAGNN's superior performance in high and medium heterophilic settings, where traditional methods fail to exploit long-range dependencies. These results highlight uAGNN's potential as a powerful tool for unsupervised community detection in diverse graph environments."
2508.15061,"On social platforms like Twitter, strategic targeted attacks are becoming increasingly common, especially against vulnerable groups such as female journalists. Two key challenges in identifying strategic online behavior are the complex structure of online conversations and the hidden nature of potential strategies that drive user behavior. To address these, we develop a new tree structured Transformer model that categorizes replies based on their hierarchical conversation structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed classification model can effectively detect different user groups, namely attackers, supporters, and bystanders, and their latent strategies. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply this classifier to real time Twitter data and conduct a series of quantitative analyses on the interactions between journalists with different groups of users. Our classification approach allows us to not only explore strategic behaviors of attackers but also those of supporters and bystanders who engage in online interactions. When examining the impact of online attacks, we find a strong correlation between the presence of attackers' interactions and chilling effects, where journalists tend to slow their subsequent posting behavior. This paper provides a deeper understanding of how different user groups engage in online discussions and highlights the detrimental effects of attacker presence on journalists, other users, and conversational outcomes. Our findings underscore the need for social platforms to develop tools that address coordinated toxicity. By detecting patterns of coordinated attacks early, platforms could limit the visibility of toxic content to prevent escalation. Additionally, providing journalists and users with tools for real time reporting could empower them to manage hostile interactions more effectively."
2508.15312,"Predicting user influence in social networks is a critical problem, and hypergraphs, as a prevalent higher-order modeling approach, provide new perspectives for this task. However, the absence of explicit cascade or infection probability data makes it particularly challenging to infer influence in hypergraphs. To address this, we introduce HIP, a unified and model-independent framework for influence prediction without knowing the underlying spreading model. HIP fuses multi-dimensional centrality indicators with a temporally reinterpreted distance matrix to effectively represent node-level diffusion capacity in the absence of observable spreading. These representations are further processed through a multi-hop Hypergraph Neural Network (HNN) to capture complex higher-order structural dependencies, while temporal correlations are modeled using a hybrid module that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Notably, HIP is inherently modular: substituting the standard HGNN with the advanced DPHGNN, and the LSTM with xLSTM, yields similarly strong performance, showcasing its architectural generality and robustness. Empirical evaluations across 14 real-world hypergraph datasets demonstrate that HIP consistently surpasses existing baselines in prediction accuracy, resilience, and identification of top influencers, all without relying on any diffusion trajectories or prior knowledge of the spreading model. These findings underline HIP's effectiveness and adaptability as a general-purpose solution for influence prediction in complex hypergraph environments."
2508.16223,"With the rapid evolution of technology and the Internet, the proliferation of fake news on social media has become a critical issue, leading to widespread misinformation that can cause societal harm. Traditional fact checking methods are often too slow to prevent the dissemination of false information. Therefore, the need for rapid, automated detection of fake news is paramount. We introduce DaCFake, a novel fake news detection model using a divide and conquer strategy that combines content and context based features. Our approach extracts over eighty linguistic features from news articles and integrates them with either a continuous bag of words or a skipgram model for enhanced detection accuracy. We evaluated the performance of DaCFake on three datasets including Kaggle, McIntire + PolitiFact, and Reuter achieving impressive accuracy rates of 97.88%, 96.05%, and 97.32%, respectively. Additionally, we employed a ten-fold cross validation to further enhance the model's robustness and accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness of DaCFake in early detection of fake news, offering a promising solution to curb misinformation on social media platforms."
2508.16453,"Distrust of public serving institutions and anti-establishment views are on the rise (especially in the U.S.). As people turn to social media for information, it is imperative to understand whether and how social media environments may be contributing to distrust of institutions. In social media, content creators, influencers, and other opinion leaders often position themselves as having expertise and authority on a range of topics from health to politics, and in many cases devalue and dismiss institutional expertise to build a following and increase their own visibility. However, the extent to which this content appears and whether such content increases engagement is unclear. This study analyzes the prevalence of anti-establishment sentiment (AES) on the social media platform TikTok. Despite its popularity as a source of information, TikTok remains relatively understudied and may provide important insights into how people form attitudes towards institutions. We employ a computational approach to label TikTok posts as containing AES or not across topical domains where content creators tend to frame themselves as experts: finance and wellness. As a comparison, we also consider the topic of conspiracy theories, where AES is expected to be common. We find that AES is most prevalent in conspiracy theory content, and relatively rare in content related to the other two topics. However, we find that engagement patterns with such content varies by area, and that there may be platform incentives for users to post content that expresses anti-establishment sentiment."
2508.16865,"Social media platforms facilitate the dissemination of science and access to it. However, gender inequalities in the participation and visibility of communicators persist. This study examined the differences in reach and audience response between YouTube and TikTok from a gender perspective. To do so, the ten most influential science accounts on YouTube and TikTok were selected, with the sample divided equally between men and women, to conduct a comparative study. A total of 4293 videos on TikTok and 4825 on YouTube were analyzed, along with 277,528 comments, considering metrics of views and interaction. The results show that on YouTube, men received more likes and views, while on TikTok, audience response was more balanced. The participation of women on both platforms also had a differential impact, as the number of women engaging with content on YouTube negatively correlated with interaction levels, whereas on TikTok, their impact was slightly positive. In conclusion, TikTok emerges as a more inclusive space for scientific communication, though structural challenges remain on both platforms, encouraging further research into strategies that promote gender equity in online science communication."
2508.17013,"We propose DSC-Flow-Iter, a new community detection algorithm that is based on iterative extraction of dense subgraphs. Although DSC-Flow-Iter leaves many nodes unclustered, it is competitive with leading methods and has high-precision and low-recall, making it complementary to modularity-based methods that typically have high recall but lower precision. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel cluster ensemble technique that combines DSC-Flow-Iter with modularity-based clustering, to provide improved accuracy. We show that our proposed pipeline, which uses this ensemble technique, outperforms its individual components and improves upon the baseline techniques on a large collection of synthetic networks."
2508.17236,"Real-world networks have high-order relationships among objects and they evolve over time. To capture such dynamics, many works have been studied in a range of fields. Via an in-depth preliminary analysis, we observe two important characteristics of high-order dynamics in real-world networks: high-order relations tend to (O1) have a structural and temporal influence on other relations in a short term and (O2) periodically re-appear in a long term. In this paper, we propose LINCOLN, a method for Learning hIgh-order dyNamiCs Of reaL-world Networks, that employs (1) bi-interactional hyperedge encoding for short-term patterns, (2) periodic time injection and (3) intermediate node representation for long-term patterns. Via extensive experiments, we show that LINCOLN outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods in the dynamic hyperedge prediction task."
2508.17563,"Social media have been fundamental in the daily lives of millions of people, but they have raised concerns about content moderation policies, the management of personal data, and their commercial exploitation. The acquisition of Twitter (now X) by Elon Musk in 2022 generated concerns among Twitter users regarding changes in the platform's direction, prompting a migration campaign by some user groups to the federated network Mastodon. This study reviews the onboarding of users to this decentralised platform between 2016 and 2022 and analyses the migration of 19,000 users who identified themselves as supporters of the platform switch. The results show that the migration campaign was a reactive response to Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter and was led by a group of highly active academics, scientists, and journalists. However, a complete transition was not realised, as users preferred to straddle their presence on both platforms. Mastodon's decentralisation made it difficult to exactly replicate Twitter's communities, resulting in a partial loss of these users' social capital and greater fragmentation of these user communities, which highlights the intrinsic differences between both platforms."
2508.17596,"The evaluation of mathematical results plays a central role in assessing researchers' contributions and shaping the direction of the field. Currently, such evaluations rely primarily on human judgment, whether through journal peer review or committees at research institutions. To complement these traditional processes, we propose a data-driven approach. We construct a hierarchical graph linking theorems, papers, and fields to capture their citation relationships. We then introduce a PageRank-style algorithm to compute influence scores for these entities. Using these scores, we analyze the evolution of field rankings over time and quantify the impact between fields. We hope this framework can contribute to the development of more advanced, quantitative methods for evaluating mathematical research and serve as a complement to expert assessment."
2508.17711,"Developing Large Language Model (LLM) agents that exhibit human-like behavior, encompassing not only individual heterogeneity rooted in unique user profiles but also adaptive response to socially connected neighbors, is a significant research challenge. Social media platforms, with their diverse user data and explicit social structures, provide an ideal testbed for such investigations. This paper introduces EvoBot, an \textbf{Evo}lving LLM-based social \textbf{Bot} that significantly enhances human-like generative capabilities through a novel adversarial learning framework. EvoBot is initialized by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on representative data from social media and then iteratively refines its generation of sophisticated, human-like content via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This refinement is guided by feedback from a co-adapting \textbf{Detector} which concurrently improves its ability to distinguish EvoBot from humans, thereby creating an increasingly challenging learning environment for EvoBot. Experiments demonstrate that EvoBot generates content aligned with diverse user profiles, increasingly bypassing the co-adapting Detector through human-like expression. Moreover, it exhibits strong social responsiveness, more accurately modeling real-world opinion dynamics and information spread in multi-agent simulations. The framework also yields a more robust Detector, underscoring its broader utility for both advanced agent development and related detection tasks. The code is available atthis https URL."
2508.18857,"Axiomatization of centrality measures often involves proving that something cannot hold by providing a counterexample (i.e., a graph for which that specific centrality index fails to have a given property). In the context of geometric centralities, building such counterexamples requires constructing a graph with specific distance counts between nodes, as expressed by its distance-count matrix. We prove that deciding whether a matrix is the distance-count matrix of a graph is strongly NP-complete. This negative result implies that a brute-force approach to building this kind of counterexample is out of question, and cleverer approaches are required."
2508.19102,"The digitalisation of childhood underscores the importance of early digital skill development. To understand how peer relationships shape this process, we draw on unique sociocentric network data from students in classrooms across three countries, focusing on peer-to-peer advice-giving and advice-seeking networks related to digital skills. Using exponential random graph models, we find that digital skills systematically spread through peer interactions: higher-skilled students are more likely to be sought for advice while less likely to seek it themselves. Students perceived as highly skilled are more likely to seek and offer advice, but it has limited influence on being sought out by others. Gender plays a significant role: girls both seek and give more advice, with strong gender homophily shaping these interactions. We suggest that digital skills education should leverage the potential of peer learning within formal education and consider how such approaches can address persistent divides."
2509.00938,"In his paper on Community Detection [1], Fortunato introduced a quality function called performance to assess the goodness of a graph partition. This measure counts the number of correctly ``interpreted"" pairs of vertices, i. e. two vertices belonging to the same community and connected by an edge, or two vertices belonging to different communities and not connected by an edge. In this paper, we explore Fortunato's performance measure (fp measure) for detecting communities in unweighted, undirected networks. First, we give a greedy algorithm fpGreed that tries to optimise the fp measure by working iteratively at two-levels, vertex-level and community-level. At the vertex level, a vertex joins a community only if the fp value improves. Once this is done, an initial set of communities are obtained. At the next stage, two communities merge only if the fp measure improves. Once there are no further improvements to be made, the algorithm switches back to the vertex level and so on. fpGreed terminates when there are no changes to any community. We then present a faster heuristic algorithm fastFp more suitable for running on large datasets. We present the quality of the communities and the time it takes to compute them on several well-known datasets. For some of the large datasets, such as youtube and livejournal, we find that Algorithm fastFP performs really well, both in terms of the time and the quality of the solution obtained."
2509.01124,"Social media platforms generate vast, complex graph-structured data, facilitating diverse tasks such as rumor detection, bot identification, and influence modeling. Real-world applications like public opinion monitoring and stock trading -- which have a strong attachment to social media -- demand models that are performant across diverse tasks and datasets. However, most existing solutions are purely data-driven, exhibiting vulnerability to the inherent noise within social media data. Moreover, the reliance on task-specific model design challenges efficient reuse of the same model architecture on different tasks, incurring repetitive engineering efforts. To address these challenges in social media graph analytics, we propose a general representation learning framework that integrates a dual-encoder structure with a kinetic-guided propagation module. In addition to jointly modeling structural and contextual information with two encoders, our framework innovatively captures the information propagation dynamics within social media graphs by integrating principled kinetic knowledge. By deriving a propagation-aware encoder and corresponding optimization objective from a Markov chain-based transmission model, the representation learning pipeline receives a boost in its robustness to noisy data and versatility in diverse tasks. Extensive experiments verify that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a unified architecture on a variety of social media graph mining tasks spanning graph classification, node classification, and link prediction. Besides, our solution exhibits strong zero-shot and few-shot transferability across datasets, demonstrating practicality when handling data-scarce tasks."
2509.01438,"Community detection in graphs is crucial for understanding the organization of nodes into densely connected clusters. While numerous strategies have been developed to identify these clusters, the success of community detection can lead to privacy and information security concerns, as individuals may not want their personal information exposed. To address this, community deception methods have been proposed to reduce the effectiveness of detection algorithms. Nevertheless, several limitations, such as the rationality of evaluation metrics and the unnoticeability of attacks, have been ignored in current deception methods. Therefore, in this work, we first investigate the limitations of the widely used deception metric, i.e., the decrease of modularity, through empirical studies. Then, we propose a new deception metric, and combine this new metric together with the attack budget to model the unnoticeable community deception task as a multi-objective optimization problem. To further improve the deception performance, we propose two variant methods by incorporating the degree-biased and community-biased candidate node selection mechanisms. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed community deception strategies."
2509.01954,"This work investigated about 10,000 COVID-19-related YouTube videos published between January 2023 and October 2024 to evaluate how temporal, lexical, linguistic, and structural factors influenced engagement during the late pandemic period. Publishing activity showed consistent weekday effects: in the first window, average views peaked on Mondays at 92,658; in the second, on Wednesdays at 115,479; and in the third, on Fridays at 84,874, reflecting a shift in audience attention toward mid- and late week. Lexical analysis of video titles revealed recurring high-frequency keywords related to COVID-19 and YouTube features, including COVID, coronavirus, shorts, and live. Frequency analysis revealed sharp spikes, with COVID appearing in 799 video titles in August 2024, while engagement analysis showed that videos titled with shorts attracted very high views, peaking at 2.16 million average views per video in June 2023. Analysis of sentiment of video descriptions in English showed weak correlation with views in the raw data (Pearson r = 0.0154, p = 0.2987), but stronger correlations emerged once outliers were addressed, with Spearman r = 0.110 (p < 0.001) and Pearson r = 0.0925 (p < 0.001). Category-level analysis of video durations revealed contrasting outcomes: long videos focusing on people and blogs averaged 209,114 views, short entertainment videos averaged 288,675 views, and medium-to-long news and politics videos averaged 51,309 and 59,226 views, respectively. These results demonstrate that engagement patterns of COVID-19-related videos on YouTube during the late pandemic followed distinct characteristics driven by publishing schedules, title vocabulary, topics, and genre-specific duration effects."
2509.0197,"With most content distributed online and mediated by platforms, there is a pressing need to understand the ecosystem of content creation and consumption. A considerable body of recent work shed light on the one-sided market on creator-platform or user-platform interactions, showing key properties of static (Nash) equilibria and online learning. In this work, we examine the {\it two-sided} market including the platform and both users and creators. We design a potential function for the coupled interactions among users, platform and creators. We show that such coupling of creators' best-response dynamics with users' multilogit choices is equivalent to mirror descent on this potential function. Furthermore, a range of platform ranking strategies correspond to a family of potential functions, and the dynamics of two-sided interactions still correspond to mirror descent. We also provide new local convergence result for mirror descent in non-convex functions, which could be of independent interest. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for explaining the diverse outcomes observed in attention markets."
2509.02098,"Temporal networks consist of timestamped directed interactions that may appear continuously in time, yet few studies have directly tackled the continuous-time modeling of networks. Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes and a static maximum-entropy edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree, clustering and motif expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of an inhomogeneous Poisson edge intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting NHPP modeling to maximum-entropy network ensembles. NHPP consistently improve log-likelihood over generic Poisson processes, while the maximum-entropy edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this framework and how it can be integrated with multivariate Hawkes calibration procedures, renewal theory, and neural kernel estimation in graph neural networks."
2509.02172,"Rumor propagation modeling is critical for understanding the dynamics of misinformation spread. Previous models are either overly simplistic or static, making them ineffective for simulating real-world rumor dynamics. In this paper, leveraging the impressive human behavior imitation capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we present a novel dynamic and hierarchical social network simulation framework, which supports simulations with millions of agents. This simulator is used to explore the rumor dynamic in the real world. Experiments on real-world rumor propagation datasets reveal a strong alignment between simulated and real-world rumor dynamics, outperforming existing models with an average 64\% reduction in opinion bias. Our findings underscore the substantial potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems in social network simulations, offering critical insights for advancing social science research. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the tightly connected local community structure within social networks is one of the key factors promoting the rapid spread of rumors. In these communities, as rumors propagate to a certain extent, some individuals, influenced by ''social pressure'', are often compelled to conform, while holders of minority opinions are further silenced, resulting in a vicious cycle that accelerates rumor dissemination. Through counterfactual experiments, we evaluate various intervention strategies and demonstrate that early and sustained efforts to correct misinformation are more effective in mitigating the spread of rumors, while debunking rumors through opinion leaders proves to be the most effective strategy. These findings provide valuable insights for public opinion management and policymaking."
2509.02334,"Most community detection approaches make very strong assumptions about communities in the data, such as every vertex must belong to exactly one community (the communities form a partition). For vector data, Hierarchical Density Based Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) has emerged as a leading clustering algorithm that allows for outlier points that do not belong to any cluster. The first step in HDBSCAN is to redefine the distance between vectors in such a way that single-linkage clustering is effective and robust to noise. Many community detection algorithms start with a similar step that attempts to increase the weight of edges between similar nodes and decrease weights of noisy edges. In this paper, we apply the hierarchical single-linkage clustering algorithm from HDBSCAN to a variety of node/edge similarity scores to see if there is an algorithm that can effectively detect clusters while allowing for outliers. In experiments on synthetic and real world data sets, we find that no single method is optimal for every type of graph, but the admirable performance indicates that hierarchical single-linkage clustering is a viable paradigm for graph clustering."
2509.02543,"YouTube Shorts and other short-form video platforms now influence how billions engage with content, yet their recommendation systems remain largely opaque. Small shifts in promoted content can significantly impact user exposure, especially for politically sensitive topics. In this work, we propose a keyframe-based method to audit bias and drift in short-form video recommendations. Rather than analyzing full videos or relying on metadata, we extract perceptually salient keyframes, generate captions, and embed both into a shared content space. Using visual mapping across recommendation chains, we observe consistent shifts and clustering patterns that indicate topic drift and potential filtering. Comparing politically sensitive topics with general YouTube categories, we find notable differences in recommendation behavior. Our findings show that keyframes provide an efficient and interpretable lens for understanding bias in short-form video algorithms."
2509.0259,"Community detection plays a central role in uncovering meso scale structures in networks. However, existing methods often suffer from disconnected or weakly connected clusters, undermining interpretability and robustness. Well-Connected Clusters (WCC) and Connectivity Modifier (CM) algorithms are post-processing techniques that improve the accuracy of many clustering methods. However, they are computationally prohibitive on massive graphs. In this work, we present optimized parallel implementations of WCC and CM using the HPE Chapel programming language. First, we design fast and efficient parallel algorithms that leverage Chapel's parallel constructs to achieve substantial performance improvements and scalability on modern multicore architectures. Second, we integrate this software into Arkouda/Arachne, an open-source, high-performance framework for large-scale graph analytics. Our implementations uniquely enable well-connected community detection on massive graphs with more than 2 billion edges, providing a practical solution for connectivity-preserving clustering at web scale. For example, our implementations of WCC and CM enable community detection of the over 2-billion edge Open-Alex dataset in minutes using 128 cores, a result infeasible to compute previously."
2509.02609,"Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a fundamental task in network analysis with wide-ranging applications across domains. While deep learning has advanced node influence detection, existing supervised approaches remain constrained by their reliance on labeled data, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where labels are scarce or unavailable. While contrastive learning demonstrates significant potential for performance enhancement, existing approaches predominantly rely on multiple-embedding generation to construct positive/negative sample pairs. To overcome these limitations, we propose ReCC (\textit{r}egular \textit{e}quivalence-based \textit{c}ontrastive \textit{c}lustering), a novel deep unsupervised framework for influential node identification. We first reformalize influential node identification as a label-free deep clustering problem, then develop a contrastive learning mechanism that leverages regular equivalence-based similarity, which captures structural similarities between nodes beyond local neighborhoods, to generate positive and negative samples. This mechanism is integrated into a graph convolutional network to learn node embeddings that are used to differentiate influential from non-influential nodes. ReCC is pre-trained using network reconstruction loss and fine-tuned with a combined contrastive and clustering loss, with both phases being independent of labeled data. Additionally, ReCC enhances node representations by combining structural metrics with regular equivalence-based similarities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCC outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across several benchmarks."
2509.02762,"Online social networks (OSNs) have become increasingly relevant for studying social behavior and information diffusion. Nevertheless, they are limited by restricted access to real OSN data due to privacy, legal, and platform-related constraints. In response, synthetic social networks serve as a viable approach to support controlled experimentation, but current generators reproduce only topology and overlook attribute-driven homophily and semantic realism.This work proposes a homophily-based algorithm that produces synthetic microblogging social networks such as X. The model creates a social graph for a given number of users, integrating semantic affinity among user attributes, stochastic variation in link formation, triadic closure to foster clustering, and long-range connections to ensure global reachability. A systematic grid search is used to calibrate five hyperparameters (affinity strength, noise, closure probability, distant link probability, and candidate pool size) for reaching five structural values observed in real social networks (density, clustering coefficient, LCC proportion, normalized shortest path, and modularity).The framework is validated by generating synthetic OSNs at four scales (10^3-10^6 nodes), and benchmarking them against a real-world Bluesky network comprising 4 million users. Comparative results show that the framework reliably reproduces the structural properties of the real network. Overall, the framework outperforms leading importance-sampling techniques applied to the same baseline. The generated graphs capture topological realism and yield attribute-driven communities that align with sociological expectations, providing a realistic, scalable testbed that liberates social researchers from relying on live digital platforms."
2509.02809,"This study presents a hybrid framework for predicting movie success. The framework integrates multi-task learning (MTL), GPT-based sentiment analysis, and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) propagation modeling. The study examines limitations in existing approaches. It models static production attributes, information dissemination, and audience sentiment at the same time. The framework uses 5,840 films from 2004 to 2024 and approximate 300,000 user reviews. It shows predictive performance with classification accuracy of 0.964 and regression metrics of MAE 0.388. Ablation analysis indicates component interactions. Selective feature combinations perform better than the comprehensive model. This result questions assumptions about feature integration. The model shows virality patterns between successful and unsuccessful films. Innovations include epidemiological modeling for information diffusion, multidimensional sentiment features from GPT-based analysis, and a shared representation architecture that optimizes multiple success metrics. The framework provides applications in the film production lifecycle. It also contributes to understanding how audience engagement leads to commercial outcomes."
2509.03319,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art data-driven tool for modeling connectivity data of graph-structured complex networks and integrating information of their nodes and edges in space and time. However, as of yet, the analysis of social networks using the time series of people's mobile connectivity data has not been extensively investigated. In the present study, we investigate four snapshot - based temporal GNNs in predicting the phone call and SMS activity between users of a mobile communication network. In addition, we develop a simple non - GNN baseline model using recently proposed EdgeBank method. Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms the baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on average worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches hold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile connectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin between ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on specialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis."
2509.03832,"Social media echo chambers play a central role in the spread of misinformation, yet existing models often overlook the influence of individual confirmation bias. An existing model of echo chambers is the ""gravity well"" model, which creates an analog between echo chambers and spatial gravity wells. We extend this established model by introducing a dynamic confirmation bias variable that adjusts the strength of pull based on a user's susceptibility to belief-reinforcing content. This variable is calculated for each user through comparisons between their posting history and their responses to posts of a wide range of viewpoints.Incorporating this factor produces a confirmation-bias-integrated gravity well model that more accurately identifies echo chambers and reveals community-level markers of information health. We validated the approach on nineteen Reddit communities, demonstrating improved detection of echo chambers.Our contribution is a framework for systematically capturing the role of confirmation bias in online group dynamics, enabling more effective identification of echo chambers. By flagging these high-risk environments, the model supports efforts to curb the spread of misinformation at its most common points of amplification."
2509.04489,"With the widespread use of the internet and handheld devices, social media now holds a power similar to that of old newspapers. People use social media platforms for quick and accessible information. However, this convenience comes with a variety of risks. Anyone can freely post content, true or false, with the probability of remaining online forever. This makes it crucial to identify and tackle misinformation and disinformation on online platforms. In this article, we propose CleanNews, a comprehensive architecture to identify fake news in real-time accurately. CleanNews uses advanced deep learning architectures, combining convolutional and bidirectional recurrent neural networks, i.e., LSTM and GRU, layers to detect fake news. A key contribution of our work is a novel embedding technique that fuses textual information with user network structure, allowing the model to jointly learn linguistic and relational cues associated with misinformation. Furthermore, we use two network immunization algorithms, i.e., SparseShield and NetShield, to mitigate the spread of false information within networks. We conduct extensive ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of each model component and systematically tune hyperparameters to maximize performance. The experimental evaluation on two real-world datasets shows the efficacy of CleanNews in combating the spread of fake news."
2509.04714,"Misleading video thumbnails on platforms like YouTube are a pervasive problem, undermining user trust and platform integrity. This paper proposes a novel multi-modal detection pipeline that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to flag misleading thumbnails. We first construct a comprehensive dataset of 2,843 videos from eight countries, including 1,359 misleading thumbnail videos that collectively amassed over 7.6 billion views -- providing a unique cross-cultural perspective on this global issue. Our detection pipeline integrates video-to-text descriptions, thumbnail images, and subtitle transcripts to holistically analyze content and flag misleading thumbnails. Through extensive experimentation and prompt engineering, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5 Flash. Our findings show the effectiveness of LLMs in identifying misleading thumbnails, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet consistently showing strong performance, achieving an accuracy of 93.8\%, precision over 92\%, and recall exceeding 94\% in certain scenarios. We discuss the implications of our findings for content moderation, user experience, and the ethical considerations of deploying such systems at scale. Our findings pave the way for more transparent, trustworthy video platforms and stronger content integrity for audiences worldwide."
2509.04823,"Digital social media platforms frequently contribute to cognitive-behavioral fixation, a phenomenon in which users exhibit sustained and repetitive engagement with narrow content domains. While cognitive-behavioral fixation has been extensively studied in psychology, methods for computationally detecting and evaluating such fixation remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for assessing cognitive-behavioral fixation by analyzing users' multimodal social media engagement patterns. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal topic extraction module and a cognitive-behavioral fixation quantification module that collaboratively enable adaptive, hierarchical, and interpretable assessment of user behavior. Experiments on existing benchmarks and a newly curated multimodal dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, laying the groundwork for scalable computational analysis of cognitive fixation. All code in this project is publicly available for research purposes atthis https URL."
2509.05591,"Scientific breakthroughs typically emerge through the surprising violation of established research ideas, yet quantifying surprise has remained elusive because it requires a coherent model of all contemporary scientific worldviews. Deep neural networks like large language models (LLMs) are arbitrary function approximators tuned to consistently expect the expressions and ideas on which they were trained and those semantically nearby. This suggests that as LLMs improve at generating plausible text, so the perplexity or improbability a text sequence would be generated by them should come to better predict scientific surprise and disruptive importance. Analyzing over 2 million papers across multiple disciplines published immediately following the training of 5 prominent open LLMs, here we show that higher perplexity scores systematically predict papers that receive more variable review ratings, longer editorial delays, and greater reviewer uncertainty. The most perplexing papers exhibit bimodal outcomes: disproportionately represented among the most celebrated scientific achievements and also the most discounted. High-perplexity papers tend to be published in journals with more variable impact factors and receive fewer short-term citations but in prestigious venues that bet on long-term impact. They also generate more interdisciplinary engagement portending long-term influence, and are more likely to have been supported by speculative funders like DARPA versus the NIH. Interestingly, we find the opposite pattern for humanities research, where the least surprising work is the most celebrated and cited. Our findings reveal that computational measures of corpus-wide linguistic surprise can forecast the reception and ultimate influence of scientific ideas, offering a scalable approach to recognize and generate potentially transformative research that challenge conventional scientific thinking."
2509.06099,"Traffic congestion propagation poses significant challenges to urban sustainability, disrupting spatial accessibility. The cascading effect of traffic congestion propagation can cause large-scale disruptions to networks. Existing studies have laid a solid foundation for characterizing the cascading effects. However, they typically rely on predefined graph structures and lack adaptability to diverse data granularities. To address these limitations, we propose a spatiotemporal adaptive local search (STALS) method, which feeds the dynamically adaptive adjacency matrices into the local search algorithm to learn propagation rules. Specifically, the STALS is composed of two data-driven modules. One is a dynamic adjacency matrix learning module, which learns the spatiotemporal relationship from congestion graphs by fusing four node features. The other one is the local search module, which introduces local dominance to identify multi-scale congestion bottlenecks and search their propagation pathways. We test our method on the four benchmark networks with an average of 15,000 nodes. The STALS remains a Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) score at 0.97 and an average execution time of 27.66s, outperforming six state-of-the-art methods in robustness and efficiency. We also apply the STALS to three large-scale traffic networks in New York City, the United States, Shanghai, China, and Urumqi, China. The ablation study reveals an average modularity of 0.78 across three cities, demonstrating the spatiotemporal-scale invariance of frequencytransformed features and the spatial heterogeneity of geometric topological features. By integrating dynamic graph learning with Geo-driven spatial analytics, STALS provides a scalable tool for congestion mitigation."
2509.06453,"In our age of digital platforms, human attention has become a scarce and highly valuable resource, rivalrous, tradable, and increasingly subject to market dynamics. This article explores the commodification of attention within the framework of the attention economy, arguing that attention should be understood as a common good threatened by over-exploitation. Drawing from philosophical, economic, and legal perspectives, we first conceptualize attention not only as an individual cognitive process but as a collective and infrastructural phenomenon susceptible to enclosure by digital intermediaries. We then identify and analyze negative externalities of the attention economy, particularly those stemming from excessive screen time: diminished individual agency, adverse health outcomes, and societal and political harms, including democratic erosion and inequality. These harms are largely unpriced by market actors and constitute a significant market failure. In response, among a spectrum of public policy tools ranging from informational campaigns to outright restrictions, we propose a Pigouvian tax on attention capture as a promising regulatory instrument to internalize the externalities and, in particular, the social cost of compulsive digital engagement. Such a tax would incentivize structural changes in platform design while preserving user autonomy. By reclaiming attention as a shared resource vital to human agency, health, and democracy, this article contributes a novel economic and policy lens to the debate on digital regulation. Ultimately, this article advocates for a paradigm shift: from treating attention as a private, monetizable asset to protecting it as a collective resource vital for humanity."
2509.06606,"From the mid-2000s to the 2010s, K-pop moved beyond its status as a regionally popular genre in Asia and established itself as a global music genre with enthusiastic fans around the world. However, little is known about how the vast number of music listeners across the globe have listened to and perceived K-pop. This study addresses this question by analyzing a large-scale listening dataset fromthis http URL. An analysis of the distribution of play counts reveals that K-pop experienced a significant increase in plays between 2005 and 2019, largely supported by a small group of heavy listeners. The Gini coefficient in play counts is notably greater than that of existing mainstream genres and other growing niche genres. Furthermore, an analysis based on user-assigned genre tags quantitatively demonstrates that between 2005 and 2010, K-pop shed its status as a local Asian genre and established itself as a distinct music genre in its own right."
2509.07328,"The process of legislative redistricting in New Hampshire, along with many other states across the country, was particularly contentious during the 2020 census cycle. In this paper we present an ensemble analysis of the enacted districts to provide mathematical context for claims made about these maps in litigation. Operationalizing the New Hampshire redistricting rules and algorithmically generating a large collection of districting plans allows us to construct a baseline for expected behavior of districting plans in the state and evaluate non-partisan justifications and geographic tradeoffs between districting criteria and partisan outcomes. In addition, our results demonstrate the impact of selection and aggregation of election data for analyzing partisan symmetry measures."
2509.07625,"Influence maximization has been studied for social network analysis, such as viral marketing (advertising), rumor prevention, and opinion leader identification. However, most studies neglect the interplay between influence spread, cost efficiency, and temporal urgency. In practical scenarios such as viral marketing and information campaigns, jointly optimizing Influence, Cost, and Time is essential, yet remaining largely unaddressed in current literature. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes a new multi-objective influence maximization problem that simultaneously optimizes influence, cost, and time. We show the intuitive and empirical evidence to prove the feasibility and necessity of this multi-objective problem. We also develop an evolutionary variable-length search algorithm that can effectively search for optimal node combinations. The proposed EVEA algorithm outperforms all baselines, achieving up to 19.3% higher hypervolume and 25 to 40% faster convergence across four real-world networks, while maintaining a diverse and balanced Pareto front among influence, cost, and time objectives."
2509.08001,"Employee turnover is a critical challenge in financial markets, yet little is known about the role of professional networks in shaping career moves. Using the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) public register (2007-2024), we construct temporal networks of 121,883 professionals and 4,979 firms to analyze and predict employee departures. We introduce a graph-based feature propagation framework that captures peer influence and organizational stability. Our analysis shows a contagion effect: professionals are 23% more likely to leave when over 30% of their peers depart within six months. Embedding these network signals into machine learning models improves turnover prediction by 30% over baselines. These results highlight the predictive power of temporal network effects in workforce dynamics, and demonstrate how network-based analytics can inform regulatory monitoring, talent management, and systemic risk assessment."
2509.08008,"The proliferation of online misinformation videos poses serious societal risks. Current datasets and detection methods primarily target binary classification or single-modality localization based on post-processed data, lacking the interpretability needed to counter persuasive misinformation. In this paper, we introduce the task of Grounding Multimodal Misinformation (GroundMM), which verifies multimodal content and localizes misleading segments across modalities. We present the first real-world dataset for this task, GroundLie360, featuring a taxonomy of misinformation types, fine-grained annotations across text, speech, and visuals, and validation with Snopes evidence and annotator reasoning. We also propose a VLM-based, QA-driven baseline, FakeMark, using single- and cross-modal cues for effective detection and grounding. Our experiments highlight the challenges of this task and lay a foundation for explainable multimodal misinformation detection."
2509.08028,"Objectives: This paper incorporates time as a crucial variable to identify key players in criminal networks and explores how actors' positions change over time. It then assesses the accuracy of the results against the uncertainty around network data collected from criminal justice records.Methods: Network data are from a judicial document for a two-year investigation targeting a drug trafficking and distribution network. We use Katz centrality in its dynamic version to explore changes in relationships and relative importance of network actors. We then use a novel method of introducing new edges to the network using Bernoulli random trials to simulate missing data and assess the extent to which node rankings based on Katz centrality change or remain the same when introducing some level of uncertainty to our observed network.Results: We identify actors who consistently held a central role over the course of the two-year investigation and differentiate them from actors who provided key contributions to the group's activities, but only for a limited period. We show that compared to centrality measures commonly used in criminal network analysis, dynamic Katz centrality is helpful to differentiate individual contributions even among central nodes and explore individual trajectories over time, even when data are incomplete.Conclusions: This paper demonstrates the value of key player identification using temporal network data and offers an additional analytical tool to both organised crime scholars trying to capture the complex nature of criminal collaboration and law enforcement agencies aiming at identifying appropriate targets and disrupting criminal groups."
2509.08128,"Social media platforms offer users multiple ways to engage with content--likes, retweets, and comments--creating a complex signaling system within the attention economy. While previous research has examined factors driving overall engagement, less is known about why certain tweets receive unexpectedly high levels of one type of engagement relative to others. Drawing on Signaling Theory and Attention Economy Theory, we investigate these unexpected engagement patterns on Twitter (now known as ""X""), developing an ""unexpectedness quotient"" to quantify deviations from predicted engagement levels. Our analysis of over 600,000 tweets reveals distinct patterns in how content characteristics influence unexpected engagement. News, politics, and business tweets receive more retweets and comments than expected, suggesting users prioritize sharing and discussing informational content. In contrast, games and sports-related topics garner unexpected likes and comments, indicating higher emotional investment in these domains. The relationship between content attributes and engagement types follows clear patterns: subjective tweets attract more likes while objective tweets receive more retweets, and longer, complex tweets with URLs unexpectedly receive more retweets. These findings demonstrate how users employ different engagement types as signals of varying strength based on content characteristics, and how certain content types more effectively compete for attention in the social media ecosystem. Our results offer valuable insights for content creators optimizing engagement strategies, platform designers facilitating meaningful interactions, and researchers studying online social behavior."
2509.08629,We introduce a new Markov Chain called the Cycle Walk for sampling measures of graph partitions where the partition elements have roughly equal size. Such Markov Chains are of current interest in the generation and evaluation of political districts. We present numerical evidence that this chain can efficiently sample target distributions that have been difficult for existing sampling Markov chains.
2509.08676,"This study examines the structural dynamics of Truth Social, a politically aligned social media platform, during two major political events: the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade and the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago. Using a large-scale dataset of user interactions based on re-truths (platform-native reposts), we analyze how the network evolves in relation to fragmentation, polarization, and user influence. Our findings reveal a segmented and ideologically homogenous structure dominated by a small number of central figures. Political events prompt temporary consolidation around shared narratives, followed by rapid returns to fragmented, echo-chambered clusters. Centrality metrics highlight the disproportionate role of key influencers, particularly @realDonaldTrump, in shaping visibility and directing discourse. These results contribute to research on alternative platforms, political communication, and online network behavior, demonstrating how infrastructure and community dynamics together reinforce ideological boundaries and limit cross-cutting engagement."
2509.08772,"We consider the problem of embedding the nodes of a hypergraph into Euclidean space under the assumption that the interactions arose through closeness to unknown hyperedge centres. In this way, we tackle the inverse problem associated with the generation of geometric random hypergraphs. We propose two new spectral algorithms; both of these exploit the connection between hypergraphs and bipartite graphs. The assumption of an underlying geometric structure allows us to define a concrete measure of success that can be used to optimize the embedding via gradient descent. Synthetic tests show that this approach accurately reveals geometric structure that is planted in the data, and tests on real hypergraphs show that the approach is also useful for the downstream tasks of detecting spurious or missing data and node clustering."
2509.08782,"In Pakistan, where dating apps are subject to censorship, Facebook matrimony groups -- also referred to as marriage groups -- serve as alternative virtual spaces for members to search for potential life partners. To participate in these groups, members often share sensitive personal information such as photos, addresses, and phone numbers, which exposes them to risks such as fraud, blackmail, and identity theft. To better protect users of Facebook matrimony groups, we need to understand aspects related to user safety, such as how users perceive risks, what influences their trust in sharing personal information, and how they navigate security and privacy concerns when seeking potential partners online. In this study, through 23 semi-structured interviews, we explore how Pakistani users of Facebook matrimony groups perceive and navigate risks of sharing personal information, and how cultural norms and expectations influence their behavior in these groups.We find elevated privacy concerns among participants, leading them to share limited personal information and creating mistrust among potential partners. Many also expressed concerns about the authenticity of profiles and major security risks, such as identity theft, harassment, and social judgment. Our work highlights the challenges of safely navigating Facebook matrimony groups in Pakistan and offers recommendations for such as implementing stronger identity verification by group admins, enforcing stricter cybersecurity laws, clear platform guidelines to ensure accountability, and technical feature enhancements -- including restricting screenshots, picture downloads, and implementing anonymous chats -- to protect user data and build trust."
2509.08803,"The rise of misinformation underscores the need for scalable and reliable fact-checking solutions. Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in automating fact verification, yet their effectiveness across global contexts remains uncertain. We systematically evaluate nine established LLMs across multiple categories (open/closed-source, multiple sizes, diverse architectures, reasoning-based) using 5,000 claims previously assessed by 174 professional fact-checking organizations across 47 languages. Our methodology tests model generalizability on claims postdating training cutoffs and four prompting strategies mirroring both citizen and professional fact-checker interactions, with over 240,000 human annotations as ground truth. Findings reveal a concerning pattern resembling the Dunning-Kruger effect: smaller, accessible models show high confidence despite lower accuracy, while larger models demonstrate higher accuracy but lower confidence. This risks systemic bias in information verification, as resource-constrained organizations typically use smaller models. Performance gaps are most pronounced for non-English languages and claims originating from the Global South, threatening to widen existing information inequalities. These results establish a multilingual benchmark for future research and provide an evidence base for policy aimed at ensuring equitable access to trustworthy, AI-assisted fact-checking."
2509.09045,"In real-world scenarios, large graphs represent relationships among entities in complex systems. Mining these large graphs often containing millions of nodes and edges helps uncover structural patterns and meaningful insights. Dividing a large graph into smaller subgraphs facilitates complex system analysis by revealing local information. Community detection extracts clusters or communities of graphs based on statistical methods and machine learning models using various optimization techniques. Structure based community detection methods are more suitable for applying to graphs because they do not rely heavily on rich node or edge attribute information. The features derived from these communities can improve downstream graph mining tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. In real-world applications, we often lack ground truth community information. Additionally, there is neither a universally accepted gold standard for community detection nor a single method that is consistently optimal across diverse applications. In many cases, it is unclear how practitioners select community detection methods, and choices are often made without explicitly considering their potential impact on downstream tasks. In this study, we investigate whether the choice of community detection algorithm significantly influences the performance of downstream applications. We propose a framework capable of integrating various community detection methods to systematically evaluate their effects on downstream task outcomes. Our comparative analysis reveals that specific community detection algorithms yield superior results in certain applications, highlighting that method selection substantially affects performance."
2509.09574,"Information sharing platforms like TripAdvisor and Waze involve human agents as both information producers and consumers. All these platforms operate in a centralized way to collect agents' latest observations of new options (e.g., restaurants, hotels, travel routes) and share such information with all in real time. However, after hearing the central platforms' live updates, many human agents are found selfish and unwilling to further explore unknown options for the benefit of others in the long run. To regulate the human-in-the-loop learning (HILL) game against selfish agents' free-riding, this paper proposes a paradigm shift from centralized to decentralized way of operation that forces agents' local explorations through restricting information sharing. When game theory meets distributed learning, we formulate our decentralized communication mechanism's design as a new multi-agent Markov decision process (MA-MDP), and derive its analytical condition to outperform today's centralized operation. As the optimal decentralized communication mechanism in MA-MDP is NP-hard to solve, we present an asymptotically optimal algorithm with linear complexity to determine the mechanism's timing of intermittent information sharing. Then we turn to non-myopic agents who may revert to even over-explore, and adapt our mechanism design to work. Simulation experiments using real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our decentralized mechanisms for various scenarios."
2509.09826,"Social media platforms shape users' experiences through the algorithmic systems they deploy. In this study, we examine to what extent Twitter's content recommender, in conjunction with a user's social network, impacts the topic, political skew, and reliability of information served on the platform during a high-stakes election. We utilize automated accounts to document Twitter's algorithmically curated and reverse chronological timelines throughout the U.S. 2022 midterm election. We find that the algorithmic timeline measurably influences exposure to election content, partisan skew, and the prevalence of low-quality information and election rumors. Critically, these impacts are mediated by the partisan makeup of one's personal social network, which often exerts greater influence than the algorithm alone. We find that the algorithmic feed decreases the proportion of election content shown to left-leaning accounts, and that it skews content toward right-leaning sources when compared to the reverse chronological feed. We additionally find evidence that the algorithmic system increases the prevalence of election-related rumors for right-leaning accounts, and has mixed effects on the prevalence of low-quality information sources. Our work provides insight into the outcomes of Twitter's complex recommender system at a crucial time period before controversial changes to the platform and in the midst of nationwide elections and highlights the need for ongoing study of algorithmic systems and their role in democratic processes."

To improve its scalability, X recently introduced ""Request Community Note"" feature, enabling users to solicit fact-checks from contributors on specific posts. Yet, its implications for the system -- what gets checked, by whom, and with what quality -- remain unclear. Using 98,685 requested posts and their associated notes, we evaluate how requests shape the Community Notes system. We find that contributors prioritize posts with higher misleadingness and from authors with greater misinformation exposure, but neglect political content emphasized by requestors. Selection also diverges along partisan lines: contributors more often annotate posts from Republicans, while requestors surface more from Democrats. Although only 12% of posts receive request-fostered notes from top contributors, these notes are rated as more helpful and less polarized than others, partly reflecting top contributors' selective fact-checking of misleading posts. Our findings highlight both the limitations and promise of requests for scaling high-quality community-based fact-checking."
2509.10333,"Although diplomatic communication has long been examined in the social sciences, its network structure remains underexplored. Using the U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks in 2010 as a case study, we adopt a network-science perspective. We represent diplomatic interactions as a hypergraph and develop a general, random-walk-based pipeline to evaluate this representation against traditional pairwise graphs. We further evaluate the pipeline on legislative co-sponsorship and organizational email data, finding improvements and empirical evidence that clarifies when hypergraph modeling is preferable to pairwise graphs. Overall, hypergraphs paired with appropriately specified random-walk dynamics more faithfully capture higher-order, group-based interactions, yielding a richer structural account of diplomacy and superior performance on interaction-prediction tasks that enables inferring new diplomatic relationships from existing patterns."
2509.10336,"Short-form video platforms like TikTok reshape how politicians communicate and have become important tools for electoral campaigning. Yet it remains unclear what kinds of political messages gain traction in these fast-paced, algorithmically curated environments, which are particularly popular among younger audiences. In this study, we use computational content analysis to analyze a comprehensive dataset of N=25,292 TikTok videos posted by German politicians in the run-up to the 2025 German federal election. Our empirical analysis shows that videos expressing negative emotions (e.g., anger, disgust) and outgroup animosity were significantly more likely to generate engagement than those emphasizing positive emotion, relatability, or identity. Furthermore, ideologically extreme parties (on both sides of the political spectrum) were both more likely to post this type of content and more successful in generating engagement than centrist parties. Taken together, these findings suggest that TikTok's platform dynamics systematically reward divisive over unifying political communication, thereby potentially benefiting extreme actors more inclined to capitalize on this logic."
2509.10715,"We employ network embedding to detect money laundering in financial transaction networks. Using real anonymized banking data, we model over one million accounts as a directed graph and use it to refine previously detected suspicious cycles with node2vec embeddings, creating a new network parameter, the spread number. Combined with more traditional centrality measures, these define an aggregate score $R$ that highlights so-called anti-central nodes: accounts that are structurally important yet organized to avoid detection. Our results show only a small subset of cycles attain high $R$ values, flagging concentrated groups of suspicious accounts. Our approach demonstrates the potential of embedding-based network analysis to expose laundering strategies that evade traditional graph centrality measures."
2509.10807,"The explosive growth of social media has not only revolutionized communication but also brought challenges such as political polarization, misinformation, hate speech, and echo chambers. This dissertation employs computational social science techniques to investigate these issues, understand the social dynamics driving negative online behaviors, and propose data-driven solutions for healthier digital interactions. I begin by introducing a scalable social network representation learning method that integrates user-generated content with social connections to create unified user embeddings, enabling accurate prediction and visualization of user attributes, communities, and behavioral propensities. Using this tool, I explore three interrelated problems: 1) COVID-19 discourse on Twitter, revealing polarization and asymmetric political echo chambers; 2) online hate speech, suggesting the pursuit of social approval motivates toxic behavior; and 3) moral underpinnings of COVID-19 discussions, uncovering patterns of moral homophily and echo chambers, while also indicating moral diversity and plurality can improve message reach and acceptance across ideological divides. These findings contribute to the advancement of computational social science and provide a foundation for understanding human behavior through the lens of social interactions and network homophily."
2509.11057,"In this paper, we introduce YTCommentVerse, a large-scale multilingual and multi-category dataset of YouTube comments. It contains over 32 million comments from 178,000 videos contributed by more than 20 million unique users spanning 15 distinct YouTube content categories such as Music, News, Education and Entertainment. Each comment in the dataset includes video and comment IDs, user channel details, upvotes and category labels. With comments in over 50 languages, YTCommentVerse provides a rich resource for exploring sentiment, toxicity and engagement patterns across diverse cultural and topical contexts. This dataset helps fill a major gap in publicly available social media datasets particularly for analyzing video sharing platforms by combining multiple languages, detailed categories and other metadata."
2509.11454,"In this work we present PercIS, an algorithm based on Importance Sampling to approximate the percolation centrality of all the nodes of a graph. Percolation centrality is a generalization of betweenness centrality to attributed graphs, and is a useful measure to quantify the importance of the vertices in a contagious process or to diffuse information. However, it is impractical to compute it exactly on modern-sized networks.First, we highlight key limitations of state-of-the-art sampling-based approximation methods for the percolation centrality, showing that in most cases they cannot achieve accurate solutions efficiently. Then, we propose and analyze a novel sampling algorithm based on Importance Sampling, proving tight sample size bounds to achieve high-quality approximations.Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that PercIS computes high-quality estimates and scales to large real-world networks, while significantly outperforming, in terms of sample sizes, accuracy and running times, the state-of-the-art."
2509.1149,"Community detection is a core tool for analyzing large realworld graphs. It is often used to derive additional local features of vertices and edges that will be used to perform a downstream task, yet the impact of community detection on downstream tasks is poorly understood. Prior work largely evaluates community detection algorithms by their intrinsic objectives (e.g., modularity). Or they evaluate the impact of using community detection onto on the downstream task. But the impact of particular community detection algortihm support the downstream task. We study the relationship between community structure and downstream performance across multiple algorithms and two tasks. Our analysis links community-level properties to task metrics (F1, precision, recall, AUC) and reveals that the choice of detection method materially affects outcomes. We explore thousands of community structures and show that while the properties of communities are the reason behind the impact on task performance, no single property explains performance in a direct way. Rather, results emerge from complex interactions among properties. As such, no standard community detection algorithm will derive the best downstream performance. We show that a method combining random community generation and simple machine learning techniques can derive better performance"
2509.11706,"We study the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model on arbitrary networks. The well-established pair approximation treats neighboring pairs of nodes exactly while making a mean field approximation for the rest of the network. We improve the method by expanding the state space dynamically, giving nodes a memory of when they last became susceptible. The resulting approximation is simple to implement and appears to be highly accurate, both in locating the epidemic threshold and in computing the quasi-stationary fraction of infected individuals above the threshold, for both finite graphs and infinite random graphs."
2509.1173,"Given its computational efficiency and versatility, belief propagation is the most prominent message passing method in several applications. In order to diminish the damaging effect of loops on its accuracy, the first explicit version of generalized belief propagation for networks, the KCN-method, was recently introduced. This approach was originally developed in the context of two target problems: percolation and the calculation of the spectra of sparse matrices. Later on, the KCN-method was extended in order to deal with inference in the context of probabilistic graphical models on networks. It was in this scenario where an improvement on the KCN-method, the NIB-method, was conceived. We show here that this improvement can also achieved in the original applications of the KCN-method, namely percolation and matrix spectra."
2509.12045,"Scientific research needs a new system that appropriately values science and scientists. Key innovations, within institutions and funding agencies, are driving better assessment of research, with open knowledge and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles as central pillars. Furthermore, coalitions, agreements, and robust infrastructures have emerged to promote more accurate assessment metrics and efficient knowledge sharing. However, despite these efforts, the system still relies on outdated methods where standardized metrics such as h-index and journal impact factor dominate evaluations. These metrics have had the unintended consequence of pushing researchers to produce more outputs at the expense of integrity and reproducibility. In this community paper, we bring together a global community of researchers, funding institutions, industrial partners, and publishers from 14 different countries across the 5 continents. We aim at collectively envision an evolved knowledge sharing and research evaluation along with the potential positive impact on every stakeholder involved. We imagine these ideas to set the groundwork for a cultural change to redefine a more fair and equitable scientific landscape."
2509.1224,"Social Internet-of-Things (IoT) enhances collaboration between devices by endowing IoT systems with social attributes. However, calculating trust between devices based on complex and dynamic social attributes-similar to trust formation mechanisms in human society-poses a significant challenge. To address this issue, this paper presents a new hypergraph-enabled self-supervised contrastive learning (HSCL) method to accurately determine trust values between devices. To implement the proposed HSCL, hypergraphs are first used to discover and represent high-order relationships based on social attributes. Hypergraph augmentation is then applied to enhance the semantics of the generated social hypergraph, followed by the use of a parameter-sharing hypergraph neural network to nonlinearly fuse the high-order social relationships. Additionally, a self-supervised contrastive learning method is utilized to obtain meaningful device embeddings by conducting comparisons among devices, hyperedges, and device-to-hyperedge relationships. Finally, trust values between devices are calculated based on device embeddings that encapsulate high-order social relationships. Extensive experiments reveal that the proposed HSCL method outperforms baseline algorithms in effectively distinguishing between trusted and untrusted nodes and identifying the most trusted node."
2509.12288,"Domestic Violence (DV) is a pervasive public health problem characterized by patterns of coercive and abusive behavior within intimate relationships. With the rise of social media as a key outlet for DV victims to disclose their experiences, online self-disclosure has emerged as a critical yet underexplored avenue for support-seeking. In addition, existing research lacks a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of DV self-disclosure, support provisions, and their connections. To address these gaps, this study proposes a novel computational framework for modeling DV support-seeking behavior alongside community support mechanisms. The framework consists of four key components: self-disclosure detection, post clustering, topic summarization, and support extraction and mapping. We implement and evaluate the framework with data collected from relevant social media communities. Our findings not only advance existing knowledge on DV self-disclosure and online support provisions but also enable victim-centered digital interventions."
2509.12396,"We analyze a simple algorithm for network embedding, explicitly characterizing conditions under which the learned representation encodes the graph's generative model fully, partially, or not at all. In cases where the embedding loses some information (i.e., is not invertible), we describe the equivalence classes of graphons that map to the same embedding, finding that these classes preserve community structure but lose substantial density information. Finally, we show implications for community detection and link prediction. Our results suggest strong limitations on the effectiveness of link prediction based on embeddings alone, and we show common conditions under which naive link prediction adds edges in a disproportionate manner that can either mitigate or exacerbate structural biases."
2509.12403,"A smart city is essential for sustainable urban development. In addition to citizen engagement, a smart city enables connected infrastructure, data-driven decision making and smart mobility. For most of these features, network data plays a critical role, particularly from public Wi-Fi infrastructures, where cities can benefit from optimized services such as public transport management and the safety and efficiency of large events. One of the biggest concerns in developing a smart city is using secure and private data. This is particularly relevant in the case of Wi-Fi network data, where sensitive information can be collected. This paper specifically addresses the problem of sharing secure data to enhance the quality of the Wi-Fi network in a city. Despite the high importance of this type of data, related work focuses on improving the safety of mobility patterns, targeting only the protection of MAC addresses. On the opposite side, we provide a practical methodology for safeguarding all attributes in real Wi-Fi network data. This study was developed in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of legal experts, data custodians and technical privacy specialists, resulting in high-quality data. On top of that, we show how to integrate the legal considerations for secure data sharing. Our approach promotes data-driven innovation and privacy awareness in the context of smart city initiatives, which have been tested in a real scenario."
2509.12616,"The main goal of this paper is to investigate an up and coming crowdfunding platform used to raise funds for social causes in India called Ketto. Despite the growing usage of this platform, there is insufficient understanding in terms of why users choose this platform when there are other popular platforms such as GoFundMe. Using a dataset comprising of 119,493 Ketto campaigns, our research conducts an in-depth investigation into different aspects of how the campaigns on Ketto work with a specific focus on medical campaigns, which make up the largest percentage of social causes in the dataset. We also perform predictive modeling to identify the factors that contribute to the success of campaigns on this platform. We use several features such as the campaign metadata, description, geolocation, donor behaviors, and campaign-related features to learn about the platform and its components. Our results suggest that majority of the campaigns for medical causes seek funds to address chronic health conditions, yet medical campaigns have the least success rate. Most of the campaigns originate from the most populous states and major metropolitan cities in India. Our analysis also indicates that factors such as online engagement on the platform in terms of the number of comments, duration of the campaign, and frequent updates on a campaign positively influence the funds being raised. Overall, this preliminary work sheds light on the importance of investigating various dynamics around crowdfunding for India-focused community-driven needs."
2509.12822,"In many real-world scenarios, an individual's local social network carries significant influence over the opinions they form and subsequently propagate to others. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model -- the Pressure Threshold model (PT) -- for dynamically simulating the spread of influence through a social network. This new model extends the popular Linear Threshold Model (LT) by adjusting a node's outgoing influence proportional to the influence it receives from its activated neighbors. We address the Influence Maximization (IM) problem, which involves selecting the most effective seed nodes to achieve maximal graph coverage after a diffusion process, and how the problem manifests with the PT Model. Experiments conducted on real-world networks, facilitated by enhancements to the open-source network-diffusion Python library, CyNetDiff, demonstrate unique seed node selection for the PT Model when compared to the LT Model. Moreover, analyses demonstrate that densely connected networks amplify pressure effects more significantly than sparse networks."
2509.13197,"We study how participation in collective action is articulated in podcast discussions, using the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement as a case study. While research on collective action discourse has primarily focused on text-based content, this study takes a first step toward analyzing audio formats by using podcast transcripts. Using the Structured Podcast Research Corpus (SPoRC), we investigated spoken language expressions of participation in collective action, categorized as problem-solution, call-to-action, intention, and execution. We identified podcast episodes discussing racial justice after important BLM-related events in May and June of 2020, and extracted participatory statements using a layered framework adapted from prior work on social media. We examined the emotional dimensions of these statements, detecting eight key emotions and their association with varying stages of activism. We found that emotional profiles vary by stage, with different positive emotions standing out during calls-to-action, intention, and execution. We detected negative associations between collective action and negative emotions, contrary to theoretical expectations. Our work contributes to a better understanding of how activism is expressed in spoken digital discourse and how emotional framing may depend on the format of the discussion."
2509.13212,"Attempts to manipulate webgraphs can have many downstream impacts, but analysts lack shared quantitative metrics to characterize actions taken to manipulate information environments at this level. We demonstrate how the BEND framework can be used to characterize attempts to manipulate webgraph information environments, and propose quantitative metrics for BEND community maneuvers. We demonstrate the face validity of our proposed Webgraph BEND metrics by using them to characterize two small web-graphs containing SEO-boosted Kremlin-aligned websites. We demonstrate how our proposed metrics improve BEND scores in webgraph settings and demonstrate the usefulness of our metrics in characterizing webgraph information environments. These metrics offer analysts a systematic and standardized way to characterize attempts to manipulate webgraphs using common Search Engine Optimization tactics."
2509.1323,"The configuration model is a cornerstone of statistical assessment of network structure. While the Chung-Lu model is among the most widely used configuration models, it systematically oversamples edges between large-degree nodes, leading to inaccurate statistical conclusions. Although the maximum entropy principle offers unbiased configuration models, its high computational cost has hindered widespread adoption, making the Chung-Lu model an inaccurate yet persistently practical choice. Here, we propose fast and efficient sampling algorithms for the max-entropy-based models by adapting the Miller-Hagberg algorithm. Evaluation on 103 empirical networks demonstrates 10-1000 times speedup, making theoretically rigorous configuration models practical and contributing to a more accurate understanding of network structure."
2509.13808,"Modern urban resilience is threatened by cascading failures in multimodal transport networks, where localized shocks trigger widespread paralysis. Existing models, limited by their focus on pairwise interactions, often underestimate this systemic risk. To address this, we introduce a framework that confronts higher-order network theory with empirical evidence from a large-scale, real-world multimodal transport network. Our findings confirm a fundamental duality: network integration enhances static robustness metrics but simultaneously creates the structural pathways for catastrophic cascades. Crucially, we uncover the source of this paradox: a profound disconnect between static network structure and dynamic functional failure. We provide strong evidence that metrics derived from the network's static blueprint-encompassing both conventional low-order centrality and novel higher-order structural analyses-are fundamentally disconnected from and thus poor predictors of a system's dynamic functional resilience. This result highlights the inherent limitations of static analysis and underscores the need for a paradigm shift towards dynamic models to design and manage truly resilient urban systems."
2509.1586,"We present PoliTok-DE, a large-scale multimodal dataset (video, audio, images, text) of TikTok posts related to the 2024 Saxony state election in Germany. The corpus contains over 195,000 posts published between 01.07.2024 and 30.11.2024, of which over 18,000 (17.3%) were subsequently deleted from the platform. Posts were identified via the TikTok research API and complemented with web scraping to retrieve full multimodal media and metadata. PoliTok-DE supports computational social science across substantive and methodological agendas: substantive work on intolerance and political communication; methodological work on platform policies around deleted content and qualitative-quantitative multimodal research. To illustrate one possible analysis, we report a case study on the co-occurrence of intolerance and entertainment using an annotated subset. The dataset of post IDs is publicly available on Hugging Face, and full content can be hydrated with our provided code. Access to the deleted content is restricted, and can be requested for research purposes."
2509.16347,"As the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) continues to prioritize fairness and the concern for historically marginalized communities, the importance of intersectionality in AI research has gained significant recognition. However, few studies provide practical guidance on how researchers can effectively incorporate intersectionality into critical praxis. In response, this paper presents a comprehensive framework grounded in critical reflexivity as intersectional praxis. Operationalizing intersectionality within the AI/DS (Artificial Intelligence/Data Science) pipeline, Quantitative Intersectional Data (QUINTA) is introduced as a methodological paradigm that challenges conventional and superficial research habits, particularly in data-centric processes, to identify and mitigate negative impacts such as the inadvertent marginalization caused by these practices. The framework centers researcher reflexivity to call attention to the AI researchers' power in creating and analyzing AI/DS artifacts through data-centric approaches. To illustrate the effectiveness of QUINTA, we provide a reflexive AI/DS researcher demonstration utilizing the \#metoo movement as a case study. Note: This paper was accepted as a poster presentation at Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO) Conference in 2023."
2509.16831,"Online discussion platforms, such as community Q&A sites and forums, have become important hubs where academic conference authors share and seek information about the peer review process and outcomes. However, these discussions involve only a subset of all submissions, raising concerns about the representativeness of the self-reported review scores. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study comparing the review score distributions of self-reported submissions in online discussions (based on data collected from Zhihu and Reddit) with those of all submissions. We reveal a consistent upward bias: the score distribution of self-reported samples is shifted upward relative to the population score distribution, with this difference statistically significant in most cases. Our analysis identifies three distinct contributors to this bias: (1) survivors, authors of accepted papers who are more likely to share good results than those of rejected papers who tend to conceal bad ones; (2) complainers, authors of high-scoring rejected papers who are more likely to voice complaints about the peer review process or outcomes than those of low scores; and (3) borderliners, authors with borderline scores who face greater uncertainty prior to decision announcements and are more likely to seek advice during the rebuttal period. These findings have important implications for how information seekers should interpret online discussions of academic conference reviews."
2509.17203,"I study Hodge decomposition (HodgeRank) for urban traffic flow on two graph representations: dense origin--destination (OD) graphs and road-segment networks. Reproducing the method of Aoki et al., we observe that on dense OD graphs the curl and harmonic components are negligible and the potential closely tracks node divergence, limiting the added value of Hodge potentials. In contrast, on a real road network (UTD19, downtown Los Angeles; 15-minute resolution), potentials differ substantially from divergence and exhibit clear morning/evening reversals consistent with commute patterns. We quantify smoothness and discriminability via local/global variances derived from the graph spectrum, and propose flow-aware embeddings that combine topology, bidirectional volume, and net-flow asymmetry for clustering. Code and preprocessing steps are provided to facilitate reproducibility."
2509.17652,"It has been well-known that many real networks are scale-free (SF) but extremely vulnerable against attacks. We investigate the robustness of connectivity and the lengths of the shortest loops in randomized SF networks with realistic exponents $2.0 < \gamma \leq 4.0$. We show that smaller variance of degree distributions leads to stronger robustness and longer average length of the shortest loops, which means the existing of large holes. These results will provide important insights toward enhancing the robustness by changing degree distributions."
2509.18289,"Homophily, the tendency of individuals to connect with others who share similar attributes, is a defining feature of social networks. Understanding how groups interact, both within and across, is crucial for uncovering the dynamics of network evolution and the emergence of structural inequalities in these network. This tutorial offers a comprehensive overview of homophily, covering its various definitions, key properties, and the limitations of widely used metrics. Extending beyond traditional pairwise interactions, we will discuss homophily in higher-order network structures such as hypergraphs and simplicial complexes. We will further discuss network generating models capable of producing different types of homophilic networks with tunable levels of homophily and highlight their relevance in real-world contexts. The tutorial concludes with a discussion of open challenges, emerging directions, and opportunities for further research in this area."
2509.18303,"Bridging content that brings together individuals with opposing viewpoints on social media remains elusive, overshadowed by echo chambers and toxic exchanges. We propose that algorithmic curation could surface such content by considering constructive conflicts as a foundational criterion. We operationalize this criterion through controversiality to identify challenging dialogues and toxicity resilience to capture respectful conversations. We develop high-accuracy models to capture these dimensions. Analyses based on these models demonstrate that assessing resilience to toxic responses is not the same as identifying low-toxicity posts. We also find that political posts are often controversial and tend to attract more toxic responses. However, some posts, even the political ones, are resilient to toxicity despite being highly controversial, potentially sparking civil engagement. Toxicity resilient posts tend to use politeness cues, such as showing gratitude and hedging. These findings suggest the potential for framing the tone of posts to encourage constructive political discussions."
2509.18325,"Vital nodes usually play a key role in complex networks. Uncovering these nodes is an important task in protecting the network, especially when the network suffers intentional attack. Many existing methods have not fully integrated the node feature, interaction and state. In this article, we propose a novel method (GNNE) based on graph neural networks and information entropy. The method employs a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn the nodes' features, which are input into a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to obtain the influence factor of nodes, and the node influence factors are used to calculate the nodes' entropy to evaluate the node importance. The GNNE takes advantage of the GCN and GAT, with the GCN well extracting the nodes' features and the GAT aggregating the features of the nodes' neighbors by using the attention mechanism to assign different weights to the neighbors with different importance, and the nodes' entropy quantifies the nodes' state in the network. The proposed method is trained on a synthetic Barabasi-Albert network, and tested on six real datasets. Compared with eight traditional topology-based methods and four graph-machine-learning-based methods, the GNNE shows an advantage for the vital node identification in the perspectives of network attack and propagation."
2509.18985,"Online social networks offer a valuable lens to analyze both individual and collective phenomena. Researchers often use simulators to explore controlled scenarios, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes these simulations more realistic by enabling agents to understand and generate natural language content. In this work, we investigate the behavior of LLM-based agents in a simulated microblogging social network. We initialize agents with realistic profiles calibrated on real-world online conversations from the 2022 Italian political election and extend an existing simulator by introducing mechanisms for opinion modeling. We examine how LLM agents simulate online conversations, interact with others, and evolve their opinions under different scenarios. Our results show that LLM agents generate coherent content, form connections, and build a realistic social network structure. However, their generated content displays less heterogeneity in tone and toxicity compared to real data. We also find that LLM-based opinion dynamics evolve over time in ways similar to traditional mathematical models. Varying parameter configurations produces no significant changes, indicating that simulations require more careful cognitive modeling at initialization to replicate human behavior more faithfully. Overall, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs for simulating user behavior in social environments, while also identifying key challenges in capturing heterogeneity and complex dynamics."
2509.1963,"Many networked systems require a central authority to enforce a global configuration against local peer influence. We study influence dynamics on finite weighted directed graphs with a distinguished hub node and binary vertex states ('Glory' or 'Gnash'). We give a sharp, local, and efficiently checkable criterion that guarantees global convergence to Glory in a single synchronous update from any initial state. At each non-hub vertex, the incoming weight from the hub must at least match the total incoming weight from all other nodes. Specialising in uniform hub broadcasts, the exact threshold equals the maximum non-hub incoming weight over all vertices, and we prove this threshold is tight. We extend the result to a tau-biased update rule and to asynchronous (Gauss-Seidel) schedules, where a single pass still suffices under the same domination hypothesis. Machine-checked proofs in Coq accompany all theorems."
2509.19857,"Hidden interactions and components in complex systems-ranging from covert actors in terrorist networks to unobserved brain regions and molecular regulators-often manifest only through indirect behavioral signals. Inferring the underlying network structure from such partial observations remains a fundamental challenge, particularly under nonlinear dynamics. We uncover a robust linear relationship between the spectral strength of a node's behavioral time series under evolutionary game dynamics and its structural degree, $S \propto k$, a structural-behavioral scaling that holds across network types and scales, revealing a universal correspondence between local connectivity and dynamic energy. Leveraging this insight, we develop a deterministic, frequency-domain inference framework based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) that reconstructs network topology directly from payoff sequences-without prior knowledge of the network or internal node strategies-by selectively perturbing node dynamics. The framework simultaneously localizes individual hidden nodes or identifies all edges connected to multiple hidden nodes, and estimates tight bounds on the number of hidden nodes. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both topology reconstruction and hidden component detection. Moreover, it scales efficiently to large networks, offering robustness to stochastic fluctuations and overcoming the size limitations of existing techniques. Our work establishes a principled connection between local dynamic observables and global structural inference, enabling accurate topology recovery in complex systems with hidden elements."
2509.20724,"Short form video platforms are central sites for health advice, where alternative narratives mix useful, misleading, and harmful content. Rather than adjudicating truth, this study examines how credibility is packaged in nutrition and supplement videos by analyzing the intersection of authority signals, narrative techniques, and monetization. We assemble a cross platform corpus of 152 public videos from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube and annotate each on 26 features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative strategies, and engagement cues. A transparent annotation pipeline integrates automatic speech recognition, principled frame selection, and a multimodal model, with human verification on a stratified subsample showing strong agreement. Descriptively, a confident single presenter in studio or home settings dominates, and clinical contexts are rare. Analytically, authority cues such as titles, slides and charts, and certificates frequently occur with persuasive elements including jargon, references, fear or urgency, critiques of mainstream medicine, and conspiracies, and with monetization including sales links and calls to subscribe. References and science like visuals often travel with emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint."
2509.20762,"Group interactions occur in various real-world contexts, e.g., co-authorship, email communication, and online Q&A. In each group, there is often a particularly significant member, around whom the group is formed. Examples include the first or last author of a paper, the sender of an email, and the questioner in a Q&A session. In this work, we discuss the existence of such individuals in real-world group interactions. We call such individuals group anchors and study the problem of identifying them. First, we introduce the concept of group anchors and the identification problem. Then, we discuss our observations on group anchors in real-world group interactions. Based on our observations, we develop AnchorRadar, a fast and effective method for group anchor identification under realistic settings with label scarcity, i.e., when only a few groups have known anchors. AnchorRadar is a semi-supervised method using information from groups both with and without known group anchors. Finally, through extensive experiments on thirteen real-world datasets, we demonstrate the empirical superiority of AnchorRadar over various baselines w.r.t. accuracy and efficiency. In most cases, AnchorRadar achieves higher accuracy in group anchor identification than all the baselines, while using 10.2$\times$ less training time than the fastest baseline and 43.6$\times$ fewer learnable parameters than the most lightweight baseline on average."
2509.21092,"This study investigates how the majority group influences individual judgment formation and expression in anonymous, spontaneous online conversations. Drawing on theories of social conformity and anti-conformity, we analyze everyday dilemmas discussed on social media. First, using digital traces to operationalize judgments, we measure the conversations' disagreement and apply Bayesian regression to capture shifts of judgments formation before and after the group's exposure. Then we analyze changes in judgment expression with a linguistic analysis of the motivations associated with each judgment. Results show systematic anti-conformity behaviors: individuals preserve the majority's positive or negative orientation of judgments but diverge from its stance, with persuasive language increasing post-disclosure. Our findings highlight how online environments reshape social influence compared to offline contexts."
2509.21187,"Technological convergence refers to the phenomenon where boundaries between technological areas and disciplines are increasingly blurred. It enables the integration of previously distinct domains and has become a mainstream trend in today's innovation process. However, accurately measuring technological convergence remains a persistent challenge due to its inherently multidimensional and evolving nature. This study designs an Technological Convergence Index (TCI) that comprehensively measures convergence along two fundamental dimensions: depth and breadth. For depth calculation, we use IPC textual descriptions as the analytical foundation and enhance this assessment by incorporating supplementary patent metadata into a heterogeneous graph structure. This graph is then modeled using Heterogeneous Graph Transformers in combination with Sentence-BERT, enabling a precise representation of knowledge integration across technological boundaries. Complementing this, the breadth dimension captures the diversity of technological fields involved, quantified through the Shannon Diversity Index to measure the variety of technological combinations within patents. Our final TCI is constructed using the Entropy Weight Method, which objectively assigns weights to both dimensions based on their information entropy. To validate our approach, we compare the proposed TCI against established convergence measures, demonstrating its comparative advantages. We further establish empirical reliability through a novel robustness test that regresses TCI against indicators of patent quality. These findings are further substantiated through comprehensive robustness checks. Our multidimensional approach provides valuable practical insights for innovation policy and industry strategies in managing emerging cross-domain technologies."
2509.21211,"Protecting privacy in social graphs requires preventing sensitive information, such as community affiliations, from being inferred by graph analysis, without substantially altering the graph topology. We address this through the problem of \emph{community membership hiding} (CMH), which seeks edge modifications that cause a target node to exit its original community, regardless of the detection algorithm employed. Prior work has focused on non-overlapping community detection, where trivial strategies often suffice, but real-world graphs are better modeled by overlapping communities, where such strategies fail. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formalize and address CMH in this setting. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that learns effective modification policies, including the use of proxy nodes, while preserving graph structure. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, offering a principled tool for privacy-preserving graph modification with overlapping communities."
2509.21596,"Spreading models capture key dynamics on networks, such as cascading failures in economic systems, (mis)information diffusion, and pathogen transmission. Here, we focus on design intervention problems -- for example, designing optimal vaccination rollouts or wastewater surveillance systems -- which can be solved by comparing outcomes under various counterfactuals. A leading approach to computing these outcomes is message passing, which allows for the rapid and direct computation of the marginal probabilities for each node. However, despite its efficiency, classical message passing tends to overestimate outbreak sizes on real-world networks, leading to incorrect predictions and, thus, interventions. Here, we improve these estimates by using the neighborhood message passing (NMP) framework for the epidemiological calculations. We evaluate the quality of the improved algorithm and demonstrate how it can be used to test possible solutions to three intervention design problems: influence maximization, optimal vaccination, and sentinel surveillance."
2509.21838,"In many real-world scenarios, interactions happen in a group-wise manner with multiple entities, and therefore, hypergraphs are a suitable tool to accurately represent such interactions. Hyperedges in real-world hypergraphs are not composed of randomly selected nodes but are instead formed through structured processes. Consequently, various hypergraph generative models have been proposed to explore fundamental mechanisms underlying hyperedge formation. However, most existing hypergraph generative models do not account for node attributes, which can play a significant role in hyperedge formation. As a result, these models fail to reflect the interactions between structure and node attributes. To address the issue above, we propose NoAH, a stochastic hypergraph generative model for attributed hypergraphs. NoAH utilizes the core-fringe node hierarchy to model hyperedge formation as a series of node attachments and determines attachment probabilities based on node attributes. We further introduce NoAHFit, a parameter learning procedure that allows NoAH to replicate a given real-world hypergraph. Through experiments on nine datasets across four different domains, we show that NoAH with NoAHFit more accurately reproduces the structure-attribute interplay observed in the real-world hypergraphs than eight baseline hypergraph generative models, in terms of six metrics."
2509.2334,"Online misinformation poses an escalating threat, amplified by the Internet's open nature and increasingly capable LLMs that generate persuasive yet deceptive content. Existing misinformation detection methods typically focus on either textual content or network structure in isolation, failing to leverage the rich, dynamic interplay between website content and hyperlink relationships that characterizes real-world misinformation ecosystems. We introduce CrediBench: a large-scale data processing pipeline for constructing temporal web graphs that jointly model textual content and hyperlink structure for misinformation detection. Unlike prior work, our approach captures the dynamic evolution of general misinformation domains, including changes in both content and inter-site references over time. Our processed one-month snapshot extracted from the Common Crawl archive in December 2024 contains 45 million nodes and 1 billion edges, representing the largest web graph dataset made publicly available for misinformation research to date. From our experiments on this graph snapshot, we demonstrate the strength of both structural and webpage content signals for learning credibility scores, which measure source reliability. The pipeline and experimentation code are all available here, and the dataset is in this folder."
2509.23411,"This paper proposes a novel community detection method that integrates the Louvain algorithm with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), enabling the discovery of communities without prior knowledge. Compared to most existing solutions, the proposed method does not require prior knowledge of the number of communities. It enhances the Louvain algorithm using node embeddings generated by a GNN to capture richer structural and feature information. Furthermore, it introduces a merging algorithm to refine the results of the enhanced Louvain algorithm, reducing the number of detected communities. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one that improves the Louvain algorithm using GNNs for community detection. The improvement of the proposed method was empirically confirmed through an evaluation on real-world datasets. The results demonstrate its ability to dynamically adjust the number of detected communities and increase the detection accuracy in comparison with the benchmark solutions."
2509.23568,"Considering higher-order interactions allows for a more comprehensive understanding of network structures beyond simple pairwise connections. While leveraging all cliques in a network to handle higher-order interactions is intuitive, it often leads to computational inefficiencies due to overlapping information between higher-order and lower-order cliques. To address this issue, we propose an augmented maximal clique strategy. Although using only maximal cliques can reduce unnecessary overlap and provide a concise representation of the network, certain nodes may still appear in multiple maximal cliques, resulting in imbalanced training data. Therefore, our augmented maximal clique approach selectively includes some non-maximal cliques to mitigate the overrepresentation of specific nodes and promote more balanced learning across the network. Comparative analyses on synthetic networks and real-world citation datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms approaches based on pairwise interactions, all cliques, or only maximal cliques. Finally, by integrating this strategy into GNN-based semi-supervised learning, we establish a link between maximal clique-based methods and GNNs, showing that incorporating higher-order structures improves predictive accuracy. As a result, the augmented maximal clique strategy offers a computationally efficient and effective solution for higher-order network learning."
2509.23627,"Natural disasters cause multidimensional threats to human societies, with hurricanes exemplifying one of the most disruptive events that not only caused severe physical damage but also sparked widespread discussion on social media platforms. Existing datasets for studying societal impacts of hurricanes often focus on outdated hurricanes and are limited to a single social media platform, failing to capture the broader societal impact in today's diverse social media environment. Moreover, existing datasets annotate visual and textual content of the post separately, failing to account for the multimodal nature of social media posts. To address these gaps, we present a multiplatform and Multimodal Annotated Dataset for Societal Impact of Hurricane (MASH) that includes 98,662 relevant social media data posts from Reddit, X, TikTok, and YouTube. In addition, all relevant social media data posts are annotated in a multimodal approach that considers both textual and visual content on three dimensions: humanitarian classes, bias classes, and information integrity classes. To our best knowledge, MASH is the first large-scale, multi-platform, multimodal, and multi-dimensionally annotated hurricane dataset. We envision that MASH can contribute to the study of hurricanes' impact on society, such as disaster severity classification, public sentiment analysis, disaster policy making, and bias identification."
2509.23716,"In the real world, the stable operation of a network is usually inseparable from the mutual support of other networks. In such an interdependent network, a node in one layer may depend on multiple nodes in another layer, forming a complex one-to-many dependency relationship. Meanwhile, there may also be higher-order interactions between multiple nodes within a layer, which increases the connectivity within the layer. However, existing research on one-to-many interdependence often neglects intra-layer higher-order structures and lacks a unified theoretical framework for inter-layer dependencies. Moreover, current research on interdependent higher-order networks typically assumes idealized one-to-one inter-layer dependencies, which does not reflect the complexity of real-world systems. These limitations hinder a comprehensive understanding of how such networks withstand failures. Therefore, this paper investigates the robustness of one-to-many interdependent higher-order networks under random attacks. Depending on whether node survival requires at least one dependency edge or multiple dependency edges, we propose four inter-layer interdependency conditions and analyze the network's robustness after cascading failures induced by random attacks. Using percolation theory, we establish a unified theoretical framework that reveals how higher-order interaction structures within intra-layers and inter-layer coupling parameters affect network reliability and system resilience. Additionally, we extend our study to partially interdependent hypergraphs. We validate our theoretical analysis on both synthetic and real-data-based interdependent hypergraphs, offering insights into the optimization of network design for enhanced reliability."
2509.24662,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly widely used for community detection in attributed networks. They combine structural topology with node attributes through message passing and pooling. However, their robustness or lack of thereof with respect to different perturbations and targeted attacks in conjunction with community detection tasks is not well understood. To shed light into latent mechanisms behind GNN sensitivity on community detection tasks, we conduct a systematic computational evaluation of six widely adopted GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, Graph-SAGE, DiffPool, MinCUT, and DMoN. The analysis covers three perturbation categories: node attribute manipulations, edge topology distortions, and adversarial attacks. We use element-centric similarity as the evaluation metric on synthetic benchmarks and real-world citation networks. Our findings indicate that supervised GNNs tend to achieve higher baseline accuracy, while unsupervised methods, particularly DMoN, maintain stronger resilience under targeted and adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, robustness appears to be strongly influenced by community strength, with well-defined communities reducing performance loss. Across all models, node attribute perturbations associated with targeted edge deletions and shift in attribute distributions tend to cause the largest degradation in community recovery. These findings highlight important trade-offs between accuracy and robustness in GNN-based community detection and offer new insights into selecting architectures resilient to noise and adversarial attacks."
2509.24679,"Geofences have attracted significant attention in the design of spatial and virtual regions for managing and engaging spatiotemporal events. By using geofences to monitor human activity across their boundaries, content providers can create spatially triggered events that include notifications about points of interest within a geofence by pushing spatial information to the devices of users. Traditionally, geofences were hand-crafted by providers. In addition to the hand-crafted approach, recent advances in collecting human mobility data through mobile devices can accelerate the automatic and data-driven design of geofences, also known as the geofence design problem. Previous approaches assume circular shapes; thus, their flexibility is insufficient, and they can only handle geofence-based applications for large areas with coarse resolutions. A challenge with using circular geofences in urban and high-resolution areas is that they often overlap and fail to align with political district boundaries and road segments, such as one-way streets and median barriers. In this study, we address the problem of extracting arbitrary shapes as geofences from human mobility data to mitigate this problem. In our formulation, we cast the existing optimization problems for circular geofences to 0-1 integer programming problems to represent arbitrary shapes. Although 0-1 integer programming problems are computationally hard, formulating them as quadratic (unconstrained) binary optimization problems enables efficient approximation of optimal solutions, because this allows the use of specialized quadratic solvers, such as the quantum annealing, and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We then develop and compare different formulation methods to extract discrete geofences. We confirmed that our new modeling approach enables flexible geofence design."
2509.24994,"Interdisciplinary research is critical for innovation and addressing complex societal issues. We characterise the interdisciplinary knowledge structure of PubMed research articles in medicine as correlation networks of medical concepts and compare the interdisciplinarity of articles between high-ranking (impactful) and less high-ranking (less impactful) medical journals. We found that impactful medical journals tend to publish research that are less interdisciplinary than less impactful journals. Observing that they bridge distant knowledge clusters in the networks, we find that cancer-related research can be seen as one of the main drivers of interdisciplinarity in medical science. Using signed difference networks, we also investigate the clustering of deviations between high and low impact journal correlation networks. We generally find a mild tendency for strong link differences to be adjacent. Furthermore, we find topic clusters of deviations that shift over time. In contrast, topic clusters in the original networks are static over time and can be seen as the core knowledge structure in medicine. Overall, journals and policymakers should encourage initiatives to accommodate interdisciplinarity within the existing infrastructures to maximise the potential patient benefits from IDR."
2509.25992,"Mental health forums offer valuable insights into psychological issues, stressors, and potential solutions. We propose MHINDR, a large language model (LLM) based framework integrated with DSM-5 criteria to analyze user-generated text, dignose mental health conditions, and generate personalized interventions and insights for mental health practitioners. Our approach emphasizes on the extraction of temporal information for accurate diagnosis and symptom progression tracking, together with psychological features to create comprehensive mental health summaries of users. The framework delivers scalable, customizable, and data-driven therapeutic recommendations, adaptable to diverse clinical contexts, patient needs, and workplace well-being programs."
2509.2622,"Spreading processes are fundamental to complex networks. Identifying influential spreaders with dual local and global roles presents a crucial yet challenging task. To address this, our study proposes a novel method, the Basic Cycle Ratio (BCR), for assessing node importance. BCR leverages basic cycles and the cycle ratio to uniquely capture a node's local significance within its immediate neighborhood and its global role in maintaining network cohesion. We evaluated BCR on six diverse real-world social networks. Our method outperformed traditional centrality measures and other cycle-based approaches, proving more effective at selecting powerful spreaders and enhancing information diffusion. Besides, BCR offers a cost-effective and practical solution for social network applications."
2510.00014,"Why do trillion-dollar tech giants AAPL and MSFT diverge into different response patterns during market disruptions despite identical sector classifications? This paradox reveals a fundamental limitation: traditional community detection methods fail to capture synchronization-desynchronization patterns where entities move independently yet align during critical moments. To this end, we introduce FTSCommDetector, implementing our Temporal Coherence Architecture (TCA) to discover similar and dissimilar communities in continuous multivariate time series. Unlike existing methods that process each timestamp independently, causing unstable community assignments and missing evolving relationships, our approach maintains coherence through dual-scale encoding and static topology with dynamic attention. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic foundations demonstrating how scale separation maximizes complementary information and introduce Normalized Temporal Profiles (NTP) for scale-invariant evaluation. As a result, FTSCommDetector achieves consistent improvements across four diverse financial markets (SP100, SP500, SP1000, Nikkei 225), with gains ranging from 3.5% to 11.1% over the strongest baselines. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness with only 2% performance variation across window sizes from 60 to 120 days, making dataset-specific tuning unnecessary, providing practical insights for portfolio construction and risk management."
2510.00019,"Interactions among notable individuals -- whether examined individually, in groups, or as networks -- often convey significant messages across cultural, economic, political, scientific, and historical perspectives. By analyzing the times and locations of these interactions, we can observe how dynamics unfold across regions over time. However, relevant studies are often constrained by data scarcity, particularly concerning the availability of specific location and time information. To address this issue, we mine millions of biography pages from Wikipedia, extracting 685,966 interaction records in the form of (Person1, Person2, Time, Location) interaction quadruplets. The key elements of these interactions are often scattered throughout the heterogeneous crowd-sourced text and may be loosely or indirectly associated. We overcome this challenge by designing a model that integrates attention mechanisms, multi-task learning, and feature transfer methods, achieving an F1 score of 86.51%, which outperforms baseline models. We further conduct an empirical analysis of intra- and inter-party interactions among political figures to examine political polarization in the US, showcasing the potential of the extracted data from a perspective that may not be possible without this data. We make our code, the extracted interaction data, and the WikiInteraction dataset of 4,507 labeled interaction quadruplets publicly available."
2510.00021,"Purpose. This study analyzes the digital representation of the Iran-Israel conflict that occurred in June 2025, based on 120,000 comments posted on YouTube. It sought to identify discursive positions regarding the actors involved and to examine how media and algorithmic biases shape digital conversations. Methodology. A mixed-methods design with triangulation was adopted. In the quantitative phase, natural language processing techniques and machine learning models (BERT and XLM-RoBERTa) were used to classify comments into ten categories. In the qualitative phase, a critical analysis of media context and ideological narratives was conducted, complemented by manual annotation and supervised training. This strategy enabled the integration of statistical robustness with contextual understanding. Results and conclusions. The findings reveal a clear overrepresentation of pro-Palestinian and anti-United States/Israel discourses, while pro-United States and anti-Palestinian positions were marginal. Iran, usually rendered invisible in global media, emerged as a central actor in the digital conversation during the conflict, suggesting a narrative shift away from previous hegemonic frameworks. Likewise, the results confirm the influence of algorithmic biases in amplifying certain discourses while limiting others. Original contributions. This work combines computational analysis and philosophical critique for the study of digital controversies, providing a methodological framework replicable in geopolitical contexts. It is one of the first Spanish-language studies to map, through artificial intelligence and critical analysis, discourses on an international conflict on YouTube, highlighting asymmetries and narrative disputes that are often overlooked."
2510.00024,"Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to automate complex interdisciplinary research domains. Epidemic modeling, characterized by its complexity and reliance on network science, dynamical systems, epidemiology, and stochastic simulations, represents a prime candidate for leveraging LLM-driven automation. We introduce \textbf{EpidemIQs}, a novel multi-agent LLM framework that integrates user inputs and autonomously conducts literature review, analytical derivation, network modeling, mechanistic modeling, stochastic simulations, data visualization and analysis, and finally documentation of findings in a structured manuscript. We introduced two types of agents: a scientist agent for planning, coordination, reflection, and generation of final results, and a task-expert agent to focus exclusively on one specific duty serving as a tool to the scientist agent. The framework consistently generated complete reports in scientific article format. Specifically, using GPT 4.1 and GPT 4.1 mini as backbone LLMs for scientist and task-expert agents, respectively, the autonomous process completed with average total token usage 870K at a cost of about \$1.57 per study, achieving a 100\% completion success rate through our experiments. We evaluate EpidemIQs across different epidemic scenarios, measuring computational cost, completion success rate, and AI and human expert reviews of generated reports. We compare EpidemIQs to the single-agent LLM, which has the same system prompts and tools, iteratively planning, invoking tools, and revising outputs until task completion. The comparison shows consistently higher performance of the proposed framework across five different scenarios. EpidemIQs represents a step forward in accelerating scientific research by significantly reducing costs and turnaround time of discovery processes, and enhancing accessibility to advanced modeling tools."
2510.00036,"This paper develops a dynamical-systems framework for modeling influence propagation in product adoption networks, formulated as a positive linear system with Metzler interaction matrices and utility-based decay. Exact solutions are derived for constant, piecewise-constant, and fully time-varying interaction structures using matrix exponentials and the Peano--Baker series. It establishes five results: (i) positive interactions guarantee nonnegative amplification, (ii) perceived utility saturates after $\approx\!3$ complementary additions (Weber--Fechner), (iii) frequency of comparable introductions dominates incremental quality improvements, (iv) reinforcing interactions yields monotone gains while decay control gives ambiguous effects, and (v) long-run retention under SIS-type dynamics is bounded by the inverse spectral radius of the adoption graph. These results extend epidemic-threshold theory and positive-systems analysis to networked adoption, yielding explicit, calibratable expressions for influence dynamics on networks."
2510.0008,"Social recommendation has been proven effective in addressing data sparsity in user-item interaction modeling by leveraging social networks. The recent integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has further enhanced prediction accuracy in contemporary social recommendation algorithms. However, many GNN-based approaches in social recommendation lack the ability to furnish meaningful explanations for their predictions. In this study, we confront this challenge by introducing SoREX, a self-explanatory GNN-based social recommendation framework. SoREX adopts a two-tower framework enhanced by friend recommendation, independently modeling social relations and user-item interactions, while jointly optimizing an auxiliary task to reinforce social signals. To offer explanations, we propose a novel ego-path extraction approach. This method involves transforming the ego-net of a target user into a collection of multi-hop ego-paths, from which we extract factor-specific and candidate-aware ego-path subsets as explanations. This process facilitates the summarization of detailed comparative explanations among different candidate items through intricate substructure analysis. Furthermore, we conduct explanation re-aggregation to explicitly correlate explanations with downstream predictions, imbuing our framework with inherent self-explainability. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four widely adopted benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of SoREX in predictive accuracy. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative analyses confirm the efficacy of the extracted explanations in SoREX. Our code and data are available atthis https URL."
2510.00469,"Understanding human mobility during emergencies is critical for strengthening urban resilience and guiding emergency management. This study examines transitions between returners, who repeatedly visit a limited set of locations, and explorers, who travel across broader destinations, over a 15-day emergency period in a densely populated metropolitan region using the YJMob100K dataset. High-resolution spatial data reveal intra-urban behavioral dynamics often masked at coarser scales. Beyond static comparisons, we analyze how mobility evolves over time, with varying emergency durations, across weekdays and weekends, and relative to neighborhood boundaries, linking the analysis to the 15-minute city framework.Results show that at least two weeks of data are required to detect meaningful behavioral shifts. During prolonged emergencies, individuals resume visits to non-essential locations more slowly than under normal conditions. Explorers markedly reduce long distance travel, while weekends and holidays consistently exhibit returner-like, short distance patterns. Residents of low Points of Interest (POI) density neighborhoods often travel to POI rich areas, highlighting spatial disparities. Strengthening local accessibility may improve urban resilience during crises.Full reproducibility is supported through the project website:this https URL"
2510.0065,"Community Notes are emerging as an important option for content moderation. The Community Notes system pioneered by Twitter, now known as X, uses a bridging algorithm to identify user-generated context with upvotes across political divides, supposedly spinning consensual gold from partisan straw. It is important to understand the nature of the community behind Community Notes, especially as the feature has now been imitated by several billion-user platforms. We look for signs of stability and disruption in the X Community Notes community and interrogate the motivations other than partisan animus (Allen, Martel, and Rand 2022) which may be driving users to contribute. We conduct a novel analysis of the impact of having a note published, which requires being considered ""helpful"" by the bridging algorithm, utilising a regression discontinuity design. This allows stronger causal inference than conventional methods used with observational data. Our analysis shows the positive effect on future note authoring of having a note published. This highlights the risk of the current system, where the proportion of notes considered ""helpful"" (and therefore shown to users on X) is low, 10%, and declining. This analysis has implications for the future of Community Notes on X and the extension of this approach to other platforms."
2510.00741,"Community detection is a fundamental problem in network analysis, with many applications in various fields. Extending community detection to the temporal setting with exact temporal accuracy, as required by real-world dynamic data, necessitates methods specifically adapted to the temporal nature of interactions. We introduce LAGO, a novel method for uncovering dynamic communities by greedy optimization of Longitudinal Modularity, a specific adaptation of Modularity for continuous-time networks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on time discretization or assume rigid community evolution, LAGO captures the precise moments when nodes enter and exit communities. We evaluate LAGO on synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to efficiently uncover temporally and topologically coherent communities."
2510.01481,"We present the Social Influence Game (SIG), a framework for modeling adversarial persuasion in social networks with an arbitrary number of competing players. Our goal is to provide a tractable and interpretable model of contested influence that scales to large systems while capturing the structural leverage points of networks. Each player allocates influence from a fixed budget to steer opinions that evolve under DeGroot dynamics, and we prove that the resulting optimization problem is a difference-of-convex program. To enable scalability, we develop an Iterated Linear (IL) solver that approximates player objectives with linear programs. In experiments on random and archetypical networks, IL achieves solutions within 7% of nonlinear solvers while being over 10x faster, scaling to large social networks. This paper lays a foundation for asymptotic analysis of contested influence in complex networks."
2510.02568,"Infected individuals in some epidemics can remain asymptomatic while still carrying and transmitting the infection. These individuals contribute to the spread of the epidemic and pose a significant challenge to public health policies. Identifying asymptomatic individuals is critical for measuring and controlling an epidemic, but periodic and widespread testing of healthy individuals is often too costly. This work tackles the problem of identifying asymptomatic individuals considering a classic SI (Susceptible-Infected) network epidemic model where a fraction of the infected nodes are not observed as infected (i.e., their observed state is identical to susceptible nodes). In order to classify healthy nodes as asymptomatic or susceptible, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with supervised learning is adopted where a set of node features are built from the network with observed infected nodes. The approach is evaluated across different network models, network sizes, and fraction of observed infections. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is robust across different scenarios, accurately identifying asymptomatic nodes while also generalizing to different network sizes and fraction of observed infections."
2510.0324,"Innovation ecosystems require careful policy stewardship to drive sustained advance in human health, welfare, security and prosperity. We develop new measures that reliably decompose the influence of innovations in terms of the degree to which each represents a field-level foundation, an extension of foundational work, or a generalization that synthesizes and modularizes contributions from distant fields to catalyze combinatorial innovation. Using 23 million scientific works from OpenAlex and 19 million works from Web of Science, we demonstrate that while foundational and extensional work within fields has declined in recent years-a trend garnering much recent attention-generalizations across fields have increased and accelerated with the rise of the web, social media, and artificial intelligence, shifting the locus of innovation from within fields to across the system as a whole. We explore implications for science policy."
2510.03899,"Balancing resource efficiency and fairness is critical in networked systems that support modern learning applications. We introduce the Fair Minimum Labeling (FML) problem: the task of designing a minimum-cost temporal edge activation plan that ensures each group of nodes in a network has sufficient access to a designated target set, according to specified coverage requirements. FML captures key trade-offs in systems where edge activations incur resource costs and equitable access is essential, such as distributed data collection, update dissemination in edge-cloud systems, and fair service restoration in critical infrastructure. We show that FML is NP-hard and $\Omega(\log |V|)$-hard to approximate, where $V$ is the set of nodes, and we present probabilistic approximation algorithms that match this bound, achieving the best possible guarantee for the activation cost. We demonstrate the practical utility of FML in a fair multi-source data aggregation task for training a shared model. Empirical results show that FML enforces group-level fairness with substantially lower activation cost than baseline heuristics, underscoring its potential for building resource-efficient, equitable temporal reachability in learning-integrated networks."
2510.04574,"Large-scale outbreaks of epidemics, misinformation, or other harmful contagions pose significant threats to human society, yet the fundamental question of whether an emerging outbreak will escalate into a major epidemic or naturally die out remains largely unaddressed. This problem is challenging, partially due to inadequate data during the early stages of outbreaks and also because established models focus on average behaviors of large epidemics rather than the stochastic nature of small transmission chains. Here, we introduce the first systematic framework for forecasting whether initial transmission events will amplify into major outbreaks or fade into extinction during early stages, when intervention strategies can still be effectively implemented. Using extensive data from stochastic spreading models, we developed a deep learning framework that predicts early-stage spreading outcomes in real-time. Validation across Erdős-Rényi and Barabási-Albert networks with varying infectivity levels shows our method accurately forecasts stochastic spreading events well before potential outbreaks, demonstrating robust performance across different network structures and infectivitythis http URLaddress the challenge of sparse data during early outbreak stages, we further propose a pretrain-finetune framework that leverages diverse simulation data for pretraining and adapts to specific scenarios through targeted fine-tuning. The pretrain-finetune framework consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving superior performance even when trained on limited scenario-specific data. To our knowledge, this work presents the first framework for predicting stochastic take-off versus die-out. This framework provides valuable insights for epidemic preparedness and public health decision-making, enabling more informed early intervention strategies."
2510.04884,"Thresholding--the pruning of nodes or edges based on their properties or weights--is an essential preprocessing tool for extracting interpretable structure from complex network data, yet existing methods face several key limitations. Threshold selection often relies on heuristic methods or trial and error due to large parameter spaces and unclear optimization criteria, leading to sensitivity where small parameter variations produce significant changes in network structure. Moreover, most approaches focus on pairwise relationships between nodes, overlooking critical higher-order interactions involving three or more nodes. We introduce a systematic thresholding algorithm that leverages topological data analysis to identify optimal network parameters by accounting for higher-order structural relationships. Our method uses persistent homology to compute the stability of homological features across the parameter space, identifying parameter choices that are robust to small variations while preserving meaningful topological structure. Hyperparameters allow users to specify minimum requirements for topological features, effectively constraining the parameter search to avoid spurious solutions. We demonstrate the approach with an application in the Science of Science, where networks of scientific concepts are extracted from research paper abstracts, and concepts are connected when they co-appear in the same abstract. The flexibility of our approach allows researchers to incorporate domain-specific constraints and extends beyond network thresholding to general parameterization problems in data analysis."
2510.06012,"An enduring challenge in contagion theory is that the pathways contagions follow through social networks exhibit emergent complexities that are difficult to predict using network structure. Here, we address this challenge by developing a causal modeling framework that (i) simulates the possible network pathways that emerge as contagions spread and (ii) identifies which edges and nodes are most impactful on diffusion across these possible pathways. This yields a surprising discovery. If people require exposure to multiple peers to adopt a contagion (a.k.a., 'complex contagions'), the pathways that emerge often only work in one direction. In fact, the more complex a contagion is, the more asymmetric its paths become. This emergent directedness problematizes canonical theories of how networks mediate contagion. Weak ties spanning network regions - widely thought to facilitate mutual influence and integration - prove to privilege the spread contagions from one community to the other. Emergent directedness also disproportionately channels complex contagions from the network periphery to the core, inverting standard centrality models. We demonstrate two practical applications. We show that emergent directedness accounts for unexplained nonlinearity in the effects of tie strength in a recent study of job diffusion over LinkedIn. Lastly, we show that network evolution is biased toward growing directed paths, but that cultural factors (e.g., triadic closure) can curtail this bias, with strategic implications for network building and behavioral interventions."
2510.06245,"Graph models help understand network dynamics and evolution. Creating graphs with controlled topology and embedded partitions is a common strategy for evaluating community detection algorithms. However, existing benchmarks often overlook the need to track the evolution of communities in real-world networks. To address this, a new community-centered model is proposed to generate customizable evolving community structures where communities can grow, shrink, merge, split, appear or disappear. This benchmark also generates the underlying temporal network, where nodes can appear, disappear, or move between communities. The benchmark has been used to test three methods, measuring their performance in tracking nodes' cluster membership and detecting community evolution. Python libraries, drawing utilities, and validation metrics are provided to compare ground truth with algorithm results for detecting dynamic communities."
2510.06453,"October 7th 2023 marked the start of a war against Gaza, which is considered one of the most devastating wars in modern history and has led to a stark attitudinal divide within and between countries. To investigate the role of media bias in reporting on this asymmetrical warfare, we analyzed over 14,000 news articles published during the first year of war in three Western (The New York Times, BBC, CNN) and one non-Western English-language outlets (Al Jazeera English). Exploring the media narratives concerning Israeli and Palestinian victims experiencing hardship, we found three systematic biases in Western media. 1) Compared to Palestinian victims, represented mainly as undifferentiated collectives, Israeli victims were more likely to be portrayed as identifiable individual human beings. 2) Despite the striking difference in all forms of hardship (casualties, displacement, etc.), Western journalists created a false balance, equating Israeli and Palestinian suffering, by persistently referring back to the 7th of October massacre, even in the absence of new events involving Israeli victims. 3) When reporting on numbers of Palestinian (vs. Israeli) victims, journalists used language that casts doubt about the credibility of the information and the reputation of the source providing it, thereby selectively undermining the reader's trust in the information regarding Palestinian suffering. Together, our analysis reveals a series of systematic journalistic biases in high-profile Western media that are absent or greatly reduced in Al Jazeera."
2510.06788,"Social media use has been shown to be associated with low fertility desires. However, we know little about the discourses surrounding childbirth and parenthood that people consume online. We analyze 219,127 comments on 668 short videos related to reproduction and parenthood from Douyin and Tiktok in China, South Korea, and Japan, a region famous for its extremely low fertility level, to examine the topics and sentiment expressed online. BERTopic model is used to assist thematic analysis, and a large language model QWen is applied to label sentiment. We find that comments focus on childrearing costs in all countries, utility of children, particularly in Japan and South Korea, and individualism, primarily in China. Comments from Douyin exhibit the strongest anti-natalist sentiments, while the Japanese and Korean comments are more neutral. Short video characteristics, such as their stances or account type, significantly influence the responses, alongside regional socioeconomic indicators, including GDP, urbanization, and population sex ratio. This work provides one of the first comprehensive analyses of online discourses on family formation via popular algorithm-fed video sharing platforms in regions experiencing low fertility rates, making a valuable contribution to our understanding of the spread of family values online."
2510.06797,"In conjunction with a social gathering held on a university campus, the movement of attendees were tracked within the venue for approximately two hours using a UWB indoor positioning system, in order to visualize their interpersonal communication. Network and community analyses were performed on attendee interaction data, and the evolution of communities over time was further investigated through repeated community analysis at different time points. Furthermore, recognizing the influence of distance thresholds on defining contact, we discussed how varying these thresholds affected the resulting network structure and community analysis outcomes. This study confirmed that the temporal evolution of communities identified through community analysis broadly corresponded with the visually observed groupings of participants using the UWB indoor positioning system."
2510.07226,"Generative Artificial Intelligence is reshaping online communication by enabling large-scale production of Machine-Generated Text (MGT) at low cost. While its presence is rapidly growing across the Web, little is known about how MGT integrates into social media environments. In this paper, we present the first large-scale characterization of MGT on Reddit. Using a state-of-the-art statistical method for detection of MGT, we analyze over two years of activity (2022-2024) across 51 subreddits representative of Reddit's main community types such as information seeking, social support, and discussion. We study the concentration of MGT across communities and over time, and compared MGT to human-authored text in terms of social signals it expresses and engagement it receives. Our very conservative estimate of MGT prevalence indicates that synthetic text is marginally present on Reddit, but it can reach peaks of up to 9% in some communities in some months. MGT is unevenly distributed across communities, more prevalent in subreddits focused on technical knowledge and social support, and often concentrated in the activity of a small fraction of users. MGT also conveys distinct social signals of warmth and status giving typical of language of AI assistants. Despite these stylistic differences, MGT achieves engagement levels comparable than human-authored content and in a few cases even higher, suggesting that AI-generated text is becoming an organic component of online social discourse. This work offers the first perspective on the MGT footprint on Reddit, paving the way for new investigations involving platform governance, detection strategies, and community dynamics."
2510.07821,"This paper aims to explore two competing data science methodologies to attempt answering the question, ""Which issues contributed most to voters' choice in the 2024 presidential election?"" The methodologies involve novel empirical evidence driven by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By using two distinct methods based on natural language processing and clustering analysis to mine over eight thousand user comments on election-related YouTube videos from one right leaning journal, Wall Street Journal, and one left leaning journal, New York Times, during pre-election week, we quantify the frequency of selected issue areas among user comments to infer which issues were most salient to potential voters in the seven days preceding the November 5th election. Empirically, we primarily demonstrate that immigration and democracy were the most frequently and consistently invoked issues in user comments on the analyzed YouTube videos, followed by the issue of identity politics, while inflation was significantly less frequently referenced. These results corroborate certain findings of post-election surveys but also refute the supposed importance of inflation as an election issue. This indicates that variations on opinion mining, with their analysis of raw user data online, can be more revealing than polling and surveys for analyzing election outcomes."
2510.08012,"Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is crucial for smart urban services such as tourism, dining, and transportation, yet most approaches struggle under cold-start conditions where user-POI interactions are sparse. Recent efforts leveraging large language models (LLMs) address this challenge through either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or in-context learning (ICL). However, SFT demands costly annotations and fails to generalize to inactive users, while static prompts in ICL cannot adapt to diverse user contexts. To overcome these limitations, we propose Prompt-as-Policy over knowledge graphs, a reinforcement-guided prompting framework that learns to construct prompts dynamically through contextual bandit optimization. Our method treats prompt construction as a learnable policy that adaptively determines (i) which relational evidences to include, (ii) the number of evidence per candidate, and (iii) their organization and ordering within prompts. More specifically, we construct a knowledge graph (KG) to discover candidates and mine relational paths, which are transformed into evidence cards that summarize rationales for each candidate POI. The frozen LLM then acts as a reasoning engine, generating recommendations from the KG-discovered candidate set based on the policy-optimized prompts. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that Prompt-as-Policy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average 7.7\% relative improvements in Acc@1 for inactive users, while maintaining competitive performance on active users, without requiring model fine-tuning."
2510.0819,"A recent line of work studies models of opinion exchange where agent opinions about $d$ topics are tracked simultaneously. The opinions are represented as vectors on the unit $(d-1)$-sphere, and the update rule is based on the overall correlation between the relevant vectors. The update rule reflects the assumption of biased assimilation, i.e., a pair of opinions is brought closer together if their correlation is positive and further apart if the correlation is negative.This model seems to induce the polarization of opinions into two antipodal groups. This is in contrast to many other known models which tend to achieve consensus. The polarization property has been recently proved for $d=2$, but the general case of $d \ge 3$ remained open. In this work, we settle the general case, using a more detailed understanding of the model dynamics and tools from the theory of random processes."
2510.08481,"Hashtag trends ignite campaigns, shift public opinion, and steer millions of dollars in advertising spend, yet forecasting which tag goes viral is elusive. Classical regressors digest surface features but ignore context, while large language models (LLMs) excel at contextual reasoning but misestimate numbers. We present BuzzProphet, a reasoning-augmented hashtag popularity prediction framework that (1) instructs an LLM to articulate a hashtag's topical virality, audience reach, and timing advantage; (2) utilizes these popularity-oriented rationales to enrich the input features; and (3) regresses on these inputs. To facilitate evaluation, we release HashView, a 7,532-hashtag benchmark curated from social media. Across diverse regressor-LLM combinations, BuzzProphet reduces RMSE by up to 2.8% and boosts correlation by 30% over baselines, while producing human-readable rationales. Results demonstrate that using LLMs as context reasoners rather than numeric predictors injects domain insight into tabular models, yielding an interpretable and deployable solution for social media trend forecasting."
2510.09031,"Large language models rely on web-scraped text for training; concurrently, content creators are increasingly blocking AI crawlers to retain control over their data. We analyze crawler restrictions across the top one million most-visited websites since 2023 and examine their potential downstream effects on training data composition. Our analysis reveals growing restrictions, with blocking patterns varying by website popularity and content type. A quarter of the top thousand websites restrict AI crawlers, decreasing to one-tenth across the broader top million. Content type matters significantly: 34.2% of news outlets disallow OpenAI's GPTBot, rising to 55% for outlets with high factual reporting. Additionally, outlets with neutral political positions impose the strongest restrictions (58%), whereas hyperpartisan websites and those with low factual reporting impose fewer restrictions -only 4.1% of right-leaning outlets block access to OpenAI. Our findings suggest that heterogeneous blocking patterns may skew training datasets toward low-quality or polarized content, potentially affecting the capabilities of models served by prominent AI-as-a-Service providers."
2510.09464,"Online narratives spread unevenly across platforms, with content emerging on one site often appearing on others, hours, days or weeks later. Existing cross-platform information diffusion models often treat platforms as isolated systems, disregarding cross-platform activity that might make these patterns more predictable. In this work, we frame cross-platform prediction as a network proximity problem: rather than tracking individual users across platforms or relying on brittle signals like shared URLs or hashtags, we construct platform-invariant discourse networks that link users through shared narrative engagement. We show that cross-platform neighbor proximity provides a strong predictive signal: adoption patterns follow discourse network structure even without direct cross-platform influence. Our highly-scalable approach substantially outperforms diffusion models and other baselines while requiring less than 3% of active users to make predictions. We also validate our framework through retrospective deployment. We sequentially process a datastream of 5.7M social media posts occurred during the 2024 U.S. election, to simulate real-time collection from four platforms (X, TikTok, Truth Social, and Telegram): our framework successfully identified emerging narratives, including crises-related rumors, yielding over 94% AUC with sufficient lead time to support proactive intervention."
2510.09585,"Community Notes (formerly known as Birdwatch) is the first large-scale crowdsourced content moderation initiative that was launched by X (formerly known as Twitter) in January 2021. As the Community Notes model gains momentum across other social media platforms, there is a growing need to assess its underlying dynamics and effectiveness. This Resource paper provides (a) a systematic review of the literature on Community Notes, and (b) a major curated dataset and accompanying source code to support future research on Community Notes. We parsed Notes and Ratings data from the first four years of the program and conducted language detection across all Notes. Focusing on English-language Notes, we extracted embedded URLs and identified discussion topics in each Note. Additionally, we constructed monthly interaction networks among the Contributors. Together with the literature review, these resources offer a robust foundation for advancing research on the Community Notes system."
2510.10307,"Understanding how accessibility shapes participation in leisure activities is central to promoting inclusive and vibrant urban life. Conventional accessibility measures often focus on potential access from fixed home locations, overlooking the constraints and opportunities embedded in daily routines. In this study, we introduce a space-time accessibility (SPA) metric rooted in the capability approach, capturing feasible leisure opportunities between home and work given a certain time budget, individual transport modes, and urban infrastructure. Using high-resolution GPS data from 2,415 residents in the Paris region, we assess how SPA influences total travel time and leisure participation, measured as the diversity of leisure activity locations. Spatial patterns show that most individuals-especially active transport users-choose destinations aligned with their SPA-defined opportunity sets, underscoring the metric's validity in capturing capability sets. Structural equation modeling reveals that SPA directly fosters leisure diversity but also reduces travel time, which in turn is associated with lower diversity. These findings highlight the value of person-centered, capability-informed accessibility metrics for understanding inequalities in urban mobility and informing transport planning strategies that expand real freedoms to participate in social life across diverse population groups."
2510.10499,"Social networks often contain dense and overlapping connections that obscure their essential interaction patterns, making analysis and interpretation challenging. Identifying the structural backbone of such networks is crucial for understanding community organization, information flow, and functional relationships. This study introduces a multi-step network pruning framework that leverages principles from information theory to balance structural complexity and task-relevant information. The framework iteratively evaluates and removes edges from the graph based on their contribution to task-relevant mutual information, producing a trajectory of network simplification that preserves most of the inherent semantics. Motivated by gradient boosting, we propose IGPrune, which enables efficient, differentiable optimization to progressively uncover semantically meaningful connections. Extensive experiments on social and biological networks show that IGPrune retains critical structural and functional patterns. Beyond quantitative performance, the pruned networks reveal interpretable backbones, highlighting the method's potential to support scientific discovery and actionable insights in real-world networks."
2510.11131,"Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential for simulating human social behaviors and interactions, yet lack large-scale, systematically constructed benchmarks for evaluating their alignment with real-world social attitudes. To bridge this gap, we introduce SocioBench-a comprehensive benchmark derived from the annually collected, standardized survey data of the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). The benchmark aggregates over 480,000 real respondent records from more than 30 countries, spanning 10 sociological domains and over 40 demographic attributes. Our experiments indicate that LLMs achieve only 30-40% accuracy when simulating individuals in complex survey scenarios, with statistically significant differences across domains and demographic subgroups. These findings highlight several limitations of current LLMs in survey scenarios, including insufficient individual-level data coverage, inadequate scenario diversity, and missing group-level modeling."
2510.11423,"Community Notes, the crowd-sourced misinformation governance system on X (formerly Twitter), enables users to flag misleading posts, attach contextual notes, and vote on their helpfulness. However, our analysis of 30.8K health-related notes reveals significant latency, with a median delay of 17.6 hours before the first note receives a helpfulness status. To improve responsiveness during real-world misinformation surges, we propose CrowdNotes+, a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment Community Notes for faster and more reliable health misinformation governance. CrowdNotes+ integrates two complementary modes: (1) evidence-grounded note augmentation and (2) utility-guided note automation, along with a hierarchical three-step evaluation that progressively assesses relevance, correctness, and helpfulness. We instantiate the framework through HealthNotes, a benchmark of 1.2K helpfulness-annotated health notes paired with a fine-tuned helpfulness judge. Experiments on fifteen LLMs reveal an overlooked loophole in current helpfulness evaluation, where stylistic fluency is mistaken for factual accuracy, and demonstrate that our hierarchical evaluation and LLM-augmented generation jointly enhance factual precision and evidence utility. These results point toward a hybrid human-AI governance model that improves both the rigor and timeliness of crowd-sourced fact-checking."
2510.11524,"Understanding the structural complexity and predictability of complex networks is a central challenge in network science. Although recent studies have revealed a relationship between compression-based entropy and link prediction performance, existing methods focus on single-scale representations. This approach often overlooks the rich hierarchical patterns that can exist in real-world networks. In this study, we introduce a multiscale entropy framework that extends previous entropy-based approaches by applying spectral graph reduction. This allows us to quantify how structural entropy evolves as the network is gradually coarsened, capturing complexity across multiple scales. We apply our framework to real-world networks across biological, economic, social, technological, and transportation domains. The results uncover consistent entropy profiles across network families, revealing three structural regimes$\unicode{x2013}$stable, increasing, and hybrid$\unicode{x2013}$that align with domain-specific behaviors. Compared to single-scale models, multiscale entropy significantly improves our ability to determine network predictability. This shows that considering structural information across scales provides a more complete characterization of network complexity. Together, these results position multiscale entropy as a powerful and scalable tool for characterizing, classifying, and assessing the structure of complex networks."
2510.11728,"Due to the advantages of hypergraphs in modeling high-order relationships in complex systems, they have been applied to higher-order clustering, hypergraph neural networks and computer vision. These applications rely heavily on access to high-quality, large-scale real-world hypergraph data. Yet, compared to traditional pairwise graphs, real hypergraph datasets remain scarce in both scale and diversity. This shortage significantly limits the development and evaluation of advanced hypergraph learning algorithms. Therefore, how to quickly generate large-scale hypergraphs that conform to the characteristics of real networks is a crucial task that has not received sufficient attention. Motivated by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), particularly their capabilities in semantic reasoning, structured generation, and simulating human behavior, we investigate whether LLMs can facilitate hypergraph generation from a fundamentally new perspective. We introduce HyperLLM, a novel LLM-driven hypergraph generator that simulates the formation and evolution of hypergraphs through a multi-agent collaboration. The framework integrates prompts and structural feedback mechanisms to ensure that the generated hypergraphs reflect key real-world patterns. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that HyperLLM achieves superior fidelity to structural and temporal hypergraph patterns, while requiring minimal statistical priors. Our findings suggest that LLM-based frameworks offer a promising new direction for hypergraph modeling."
2510.11739,"Social media has become an essential part of the digital age, serving as a platform for communication, interaction, and information sharing. Celebrities are among the most active users and often reveal aspects of their personal and professional lives through online posts. Platforms such as Twitter provide an opportunity to analyze language and behavior for understanding demographic and social patterns. Since followers frequently share linguistic traits and interests with the celebrities they follow, textual data from followers can be used to predict celebrity demographics. However, most existing research in this field has focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving Urdu largely unexplored.This study applies modern machine learning and deep learning techniques to the problem of celebrity profiling in Urdu. A dataset of short Urdu tweets from followers of subcontinent celebrities was collected and preprocessed. Multiple algorithms were trained and compared, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and cumulative rank (cRank). The best performance was achieved for gender prediction with a cRank of 0.65 and an accuracy of 0.65, followed by moderate results for age, profession, and fame prediction. These results demonstrate that follower-based linguistic features can be effectively leveraged using machine learning and neural approaches for demographic prediction in Urdu, a low-resource language."
2510.11746,"This study examines elite-driven political communication on Telegram during the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, the first large-scale European war in the social media era. Using a unique dataset of Telegram public posts from Ukrainian and Russian policymakers (2019-2024), we analyze changes in communication volume, thematic content, and actor engagement following Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion. Our findings show a sharp increase in Telegram activity after the invasion, particularly among ruling-party policymakers. Ukrainian policymakers initially focused on war-related topics, but this emphasis declined over time In contrast, Russian policymakers largely avoided war-related discussions, instead emphasizing unrelated topics, such as Western crises, to distract public attention. We also identify differences in communication strategies between large and small parties, as well as individual policymakers. Our findings shed light on how policymakers adapt to wartime communication challenges and offer critical insights into the dynamics of online political discourse during times of war."
2510.12125,"The spread of fake news on social media poses a serious threat to public trust and societal stability. While propagation-based methods improve fake news detection by modeling how information spreads, they often suffer from incomplete propagation data. Recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic propagation, but typically overlooks the structural patterns of real-world discussions. In this paper, we propose a novel structure-aware synthetic propagation enhanced detection (StruSP) framework to fully capture structural dynamics from real propagation. It enables LLMs to generate realistic and structurally consistent propagation for better detection. StruSP explicitly aligns synthetic propagation with real-world propagation in both semantic and structural dimensions. Besides, we also design a new bidirectional evolutionary propagation (BEP) learning strategy to better align LLMs with structural patterns of propagation in the real world via structure-aware hybrid sampling and masked propagation modeling objective. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that StruSP significantly improves fake news detection performance in various practical detection scenarios. Further analysis indicates that BEP enables the LLM to generate more realistic and diverse propagation semantically and structurally."
2510.12243,"As social media adoption grows globally, online problematic behaviors increasingly escalate into large-scale crises, requiring an evolving set of mitigation strategies. While HCI research often analyzes problematic behaviors with pieces of user-generated content as the unit of analysis, less attention has been given to event-focused perspectives that track how discrete events evolve. In this paper, we examine 'social media crises': discrete patterns of problematic behaviors originating and evolving within social media that cause larger-scale harms. Using global news coverage, we present a dataset of 93,250 news articles covering social media-endemic crises from the past 20 years. We analyze a representative subset to classify stakeholder roles, behavior types, and outcomes, uncovering patterns that inform more nuanced classification of social media crises beyond content-based descriptions. By adopting a wider perspective, this research seeks to inform the design of safer platforms, enabling proactive measures to mitigate crises and foster more trustworthy online environments."
2510.12348,"In this paper, we propose MOUFLON, a fairness-aware, modularity-based community detection method that allows adjusting the importance of partition quality over fairness outcomes. MOUFLON uses a novel proportional balance fairness metric, providing consistent and comparable fairness scores across multi-group and imbalanced network settings. We evaluate our method under both synthetic and real network datasets, focusing on performance and the trade-off between modularity and fairness in the resulting communities, along with the impact of network characteristics such as size, density, and group distribution. As structural biases can lead to strong alignment between demographic groups and network structure, we also examine scenarios with highly clustered homogeneous groups, to understand how such structures influence fairness outcomes. Our findings showcase the effects of incorporating fairness constraints into modularity-based community detection, and highlight key considerations for designing and benchmarking fairness-aware social network analysis methods."
2510.12559,"This study presents the first large-scale quantitative analysis of the efficiency of X's Community Notes, a crowdsourced moderation system for identifying and contextualising potentially misleading content. Drawing on over 1.8 million notes, we examine three key dimensions of crowdsourced moderation: participation inequality, consensus formation, and timeliness. Despite the system's goal of collective moderation, we find substantial concentration effect, with the top 10% of contributors producing 58% of all notes (Gini Coefficient = 0.68). The observed consensus is rare-only 11.5% of notes reach agreement on publication, while 69% of posts receive conflicting classifications. A majority of noted posts (approximately 68%) are annotated as ""Note Not Needed"", reflecting the repurposing of the platform for debate rather than moderation. We found that such posts are paradoxically more likely to yield published notes (OR = 3.12). Temporal analyses show that the notes, on average, are published 65.7 hours after the original post, with longer delays significantly reducing the likelihood of consensus. These results portray Community Notes as a stratified, deliberative system dominated by a small contributor elite, marked by persistent dissensus, and constrained by timeliness. We conclude this study by outlining design strategies to promote equity, faster consensus, and epistemic reliability in community-based moderation."
2510.13273,"Although more women than men enter social science disciplines, they are underrepresented at senior levels. To investigate this leaky pipeline, this study analyzed the career trajectories of 78,216 psychology researchers using large-scale bibliometric data. Despite overall constituting over 60\% of these researchers, women experienced consistently higher attrition rates than men, particularly in the early years following their first publication. Academic performance, particularly first-authored publications, was strongly associated with early-career retention -- more so than collaboration networks or institutional environment. After controlling for gender differences in publication-, collaboration-, and institution-level factors, women remained more likely to leave academia, especially in early-career stages, pointing to persistent barriers that hinder women's academic careers. These findings suggest that in psychology and potentially other social science disciplines, the core challenge lies in retention rather than recruitment, underscoring the need for targeted, early-career interventions to promote long-term gender equity."
2510.14327,"Recent work in the information sciences, especially informetrics and scientometrics, has made substantial contributions to the development of new metrics that eschew the intrinsic biases of citation metrics. This work has tended to employ either network scientific (topological) approaches to quantifying the disruptiveness of peer-reviewed research, or topic modeling approaches to quantifying conceptual novelty. We propose a combination of these approaches, investigating the prospect of topological data analysis (TDA), specifically persistent homology and mixup barcodes, as a means of understanding the negative space among document embeddings generated by topic models. Using top2vec, we embed documents and topics in n-dimensional space, we use persistent homology to identify holes in the embedding distribution, and then use mixup barcodes to determine which holes are being filled by a set of unobserved publications. In this case, the unobserved publications represent research that was published before or after the data used to train top2vec. We investigate the extent that negative embedding space represents missing context (older research) versus innovation space (newer research), and the extend that the documents that occupy this space represents integrations of the research topics on the periphery. Potential applications for this metric are discussed."
2510.14889,"On social media, many individuals experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) do not disclose their distress explicitly. Instead, signs may surface indirectly through everyday posts or peer interactions. Detecting such implicit signals early is critical but remains challenging. We frame early and implicit SI as a forward-looking prediction task and develop a computational framework that models a user's information environment, consisting of both their longitudinal posting histories as well as the discourse of their socially proximal peers. We adopted a composite network centrality measure to identify top neighbors of a user, and temporally aligned the user's and neighbors' interactions -- integrating the multi-layered signals in a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model. In a Reddit study of 1,000 (500 Case and 500 Control) users, our approach improves early and implicit SI detection by 15% over individual-only baselines. These findings highlight that peer interactions offer valuable predictive signals and carry broader implications for designing early detection systems that capture indirect as well as masked expressions of risk in online environments."
2510.16969,"Timely and effective decision-making is critical during epidemics to reduce preventable infections and deaths. This demands integrated models that jointly capture disease dynamics, vaccine distribution, regional disparities, and behavioral responses. However, most existing approaches decouple epidemic forecasting from logistics planning, hindering adaptive and regionally responsive interventions. We propose a novel epidemiological-optimization framework that jointly models epidemic progression and a multiscale vaccine supply chain. The model incorporates spatio-temporally varying effective infection rates to reflect regional policy and behavioral dynamics. It supports coordinated, data-driven decision-making across spatial scales through two formulations: a multi-objective Gini-based model and a knapsack-based model that leverages regional vulnerability indicators for tractability and improved mitigation. To address computational complexity, we design two scalable heuristic decomposition algorithms inspired by the Benders decomposition. The model is validated using COVID-19 data in the U.S.. We introduce SARIMA-based forecasting as a novel approach for validating epidemic-optimization models under data limitations. The results show that our approach can prevent more than 2 million infections and 30,000 deaths in just six months while significantly improving the accessibility of vaccines in underserved regions. Our framework demonstrates that integrating fairness and epidemic dynamics with vaccine logistics leads to superior outcomes compared to traditional myopic policies. Fairness improves overall efficiency in the long term by prioritizing the most vulnerable populations, leading to better long-term public health outcomes. The model offers policymakers a scalable and operationally relevant tool to strengthen preparedness and ensure a more effective and equitable response to epidemics."
2510.17153,"Higher-order interactions (HOIs) in complex systems, such as scientific collaborations, multi-protein complexes, and multi-user communications, are commonly modeled as hypergraphs, where each hyperedge (i.e., a subset of nodes) represents an HOI among the nodes. Given a hypergraph, hyperedge prediction aims to identify hyperedges that are either missing or likely to form in the future, and it has broad applications, including recommending interest-based social groups, predicting collaborations, and uncovering functional complexes in biological systems. However, the vast search space of hyperedge candidates (i.e., all possible subsets of nodes) poses a significant computational challenge, making naive exhaustive search infeasible. As a result, existing approaches rely on either heuristic sampling to obtain constrained candidate sets or ungrounded assumptions on hypergraph structure to select promising hyperedges.In this work, we propose HyperSearch, a search-based algorithm for hyperedge prediction that efficiently evaluates unconstrained candidate sets, by incorporating two key components: (1) an empirically grounded scoring function derived from observations in real-world hypergraphs and (2) an efficient search mechanism, where we derive and use an anti-monotonic upper bound of the original scoring function (which is not antimonotonic) to prune the search space. This pruning comes with theoretical guarantees, ensuring that discarded candidates are never better than the kept ones w.r.t. the original scoring function. In extensive experiments on 10 real-world hypergraphs across five domains, HyperSearch consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy in predicting new (i.e., not in the training set) hyperedges."
2510.17226,"Public opinion governance in social networks is critical for public health campaigns, political elections, and commercial marketing. In this paper, we addresse the problem of maximizing overall opinion in social networks by strategically modifying the internal opinions of key nodes. Traditional matrix inversion methods suffer from prohibitively high computational costs, prompting us to propose two efficient sampling-based algorithms. Furthermore, we develop a deterministic asynchronous algorithm that exactly identifies the optimal set of nodes through asynchronous update operations and progressive refinement, ensuring both efficiency and precision. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods outperform baseline approaches. Notably, our asynchronous algorithm delivers exceptional efficiency and accuracy across all scenarios, even in networks with tens of millions of nodes."
2510.1828,"Human social networks are inherently multiplex, comprising overlapping layers of relationships. Different layers may have distinct structural properties and interpersonal dynamics, but also may interact to form complex interdependent pathways for social contagion. This poses a fundamental problem in understanding behavioral diffusion and in devising effective network-based interventions. Here, we introduce a new conceptualization of how much each network layer contributes to critical contagion pathways and quantify it using a novel metric, network torque. We exploit data regarding sociocentric maps of 110 rural Honduran communities using a battery of 11 name generators and an experiment involving an exogenous intervention. Using a novel statistical framework, we assess the extent to which specific network layers alter global connectivity and support the spread of three experimentally introduced health practices. The results show that specific relationship types - such as close friendships - particularly enable non-overlapping diffusion pathways, amplifying behavioral change at the village level. For instance, non-redundant pathways enabled by closest friends can increase the adoption of correct knowledge about feeding newborns inappropriate chupones and enhance attitudes regarding fathers' involvement in postpartum care. Non-overlapping multiplex social ties are relevant to social contagion and social coherence in traditionally organized social systems."
2511.00329,"Much ethical evaluation treats actions dyadically: one agent acts on one recipient. In networked, platform-mediated environments, this lens misses how public acts diffuse. We introduce a minimal message-passing model in which an initiating act with baseline valence w spreads across a social graph with exposure b, per-hop salience $alpha$, compliance $q$, and depth (horizon) d. The model yields a closed-form \emph{network multiplier} relative to the dyadic baseline and identifies a threshold at r=b.alpha.q=1 separating subcritical (saturating), critical (linear), and supercritical (geometric) regimes. We show how common platform design levers -- reach and fan-out (affecting b), ranking and context (affecting alpha), share mechanics and friction (affecting q), and time-bounds (affecting d) -- systematically change expected downstream responsibility Applications include pandemic mitigation and vaccination externalities, as well as platform amplification of prosocial and harmful norms."
2511.00339,"Network centrality is a foundational concept for quantifying the importance of nodes within a network. Many traditional centrality measures--such as degree and betweenness centrality--are purely structural and often overlook the dynamics that unfold across the network. However, the notion of a node's importance is inherently context-dependent and must reflect both the system's dynamics and the specific objectives guiding its operation. Motivated by this perspective, we propose a dynamic, task-aware centrality framework rooted in optimal control theory. By formulating a problem on minimum energy control of average opinion based on Laplacian dynamics and focusing on the variance of terminal state, we introduce a novel centrality measure--termed U-centrality--that quantifies a node's ability to unify the agents' state. We demonstrate that U-centrality interpolates between known measures: it aligns with degree centrality in the short-time horizon and converges to a new centrality over longer time scales which is closely related to current-flow closeness centrality. This work bridges structural and dynamical approaches to centrality, offering a principled, versatile tool for network analysis in dynamic environments."
2511.00401,"Opinion dynamics, the evolution of individuals through social interactions, is an important area of research with applications ranging from politics to marketing. Due to its interdisciplinary relevance, studies of opinion dynamics remain fragmented across computer science, mathematics, the social sciences, and physics, and often lack shared frameworks. This survey bridges these gaps by reviewing well-known models of opinion dynamics within a unified framework and categorizing them into distinct classes based on their properties. Furthermore, the key findings on these models are covered in three parts: convergence properties, viral marketing, and user characteristics. We first analyze the final configuration (consensus vs polarized) and convergence time for each model. We then review the main algorithmic, complexity, and combinatorial results in the context of viral marketing. Finally, we explore how node characteristics, such as stubbornness, activeness, or neutrality, shape diffusion outcomes. By unifying terminology, methods, and challenges across disciplines, this paper aims to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration and accelerate progress in understanding and harnessing opinion dynamics."
2511.0409,"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems often reflect biases from economically advanced regions, marginalizing contexts in economically developing regions like Latin America due to imbalanced datasets. This paper examines AI representations of diverse Latin American contexts, revealing disparities between data from economically advanced and developing regions. We highlight how the dominance of English over Spanish, Portuguese, and indigenous languages such as Quechua and Nahuatl perpetuates biases, framing Latin American perspectives through a Western lens. To address this, we introduce a culturally aware dataset rooted in Latin American history and socio-political contexts, challenging Eurocentric models. We evaluate six language models on questions testing cultural context awareness, using a novel Cultural Expressiveness metric, statistical tests, and linguistic analyses. Our findings show that some models better capture Latin American perspectives, while others exhibit significant sentiment misalignment (p < 0.001). Fine-tuning Mistral-7B with our dataset improves its cultural expressiveness by 42.9%, advancing equitable AI development.

2511.00768,"Measuring similarity in urban spatial networks is key to understanding cities as complex systems. Yet most existing methods are not tailored for spatial networks and struggle to differentiate them effectively. We propose GCA-Sim, a similarity-evaluation framework based on graph cellular automata. Each submodel measures similarity by the divergence between value distributions recorded at multiple stages of an information evolution process. We find that some propagation rules magnify differences among network signals; we call this ""network resonance."" With an improved differentiable logic-gate network, we learn several submodels that induce network resonance. We evaluate similarity through clustering performance on fifty city-level and fifty district-level road networks. The submodels in this framework outperform existing methods, with Silhouette scores above 0.9. Using the best submodel, we further observe that planning-led street networks are less internally homogeneous than organically grown ones; morphological categories from different domains contribute with comparable importance; and degree, as a basic topological signal, becomes increasingly aligned with land value and related variables over iterations."
2511.00818,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly transforming biomedical discovery and clinical innovation, yet their impact extends far beyond algorithmic revolution-LLMs are restructuring how scientific collaboration occurs, who participates, and how resources shape innovation. Despite this profound transformation, how this rapid technological shift is reshaping the structure and equity of scientific collaboration in biomedical LLM research remains largely unknown. By analyzing 5,674 LLM-related biomedical publications from PubMed, we examine how collaboration diversity evolves over time, identify institutions and disciplines that anchor and bridge collaboration networks, and assess how resource disparities underpin research performance. We find that collaboration diversity has grown steadily, with a decreasing share of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence authors, suggesting that LLMs are lowering technical barriers for biomedical investigators. Network analysis reveals central institutions, including Stanford University and Harvard Medical School, and bridging disciplines such as Medicine and Computer Science that anchor collaborations in this field. Furthermore, biomedical research resources are strongly linked to research performance, with high-performing resource-constrained institutions exhibiting larger collaboration volume with the top 1% most connected institutions in the network. Together, these findings reveal a complex landscape, where democratizing trends coexist with a persistent, resource-driven hierarchy, highlighting the critical role of strategic collaboration in this evolving field."
2511.00827,"This paper presents the first empirical analysis of how diverse token-based reward mechanisms impact platform dynamics and user behaviors. For this, we gather a unique, large-scale dataset from Farcaster. This blockchain-based, decentralized social network incorporates multiple incentive mechanisms spanning platform-native rewards, third-party token programs, and peer-to-peer tipping. Our dataset captures token transactions and social interactions from 574,829 wallet-linked users, representing 64.25% of the platform's user base. Our socioeconomic analyses reveal how different tokenomics design shape varying participation rates (7.6%--70%) and wealth concentration patterns (Gini 0.72--0.94), whereas inter-community tipping is 1.3--2x more frequent among non-following pairs, thereby mitigating echo chambers. Our causal analyses further uncover several critical trade-offs: (1) while most token rewards boost content creation, they often fail to enhance -- sometimes undermining -- content quality; (2) token rewards increase follower acquisition but show neutral or negative effects on outbound following, suggesting potential asymmetric network growth; (3) repeated algorithmic rewards demonstrate strong cumulative effects that may encourage strategic optimization. Our findings advance understanding of cryptocurrency integration in social platforms and highlight challenges in aligning economic incentives with authentic social value."
2511.01086,"Online reviews shape impressions across products and workplaces. Employer reviews combine narratives and ratings that reflect culture. Glassdoor permits fully anonymous posts; Blind requires employment verification while preserving anonymity. We ask how verification changes reviews. Evidence suggests verified reviews can be more trustworthy, yet verification can also erode authenticity when expectations are unmet. We use the Competing Values Framework (clan, adhocracy, hierarchy, market) and the CultureBERT model by Koch and Pasch, 2023 to over 300k ratings. We find that Blind reviews emphasize clan and hierarchy while Glassdoor skews positive and highlights clan and market. Verification on its own does not remove bias but shifts how culture is represented. Job seekers using different platforms receive systematically different signals about workplace culture, affecting application decisions and job-matching."
2511.01142,"Numerous social movements (SMs) around the world help support the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Understanding how key events shape SMs is key to the achievement of the SDGs. We have developed SMART (Social Media Analysis & Reasoning Tool) to track social movements related to the SDGs. SMART was designed by a multidisciplinary team of AI researchers, journalists, communications scholars and legal experts. This paper describes SMART's transformer-based multivariate time series Discourse Evolution Engine for Predictions about Social Movements (DEEP) to predict the volume of future articles/posts and the emotions expressed. DEEP outputs probabilistic forecasts with uncertainty estimates, providing critical support for editorial planning and strategic decision-making. We evaluate DEEP with a case study of the #MeToo movement by creating a novel longitudinal dataset (433K Reddit posts and 121K news articles) from September 2024 to June 2025 that will be publicly released for research purposes upon publication of this paper."
2511.01228,"Node importance ranking is a fundamental problem in graph data analysis. Existing approaches typically rely on node features derived from either traditional centrality measures or advanced graph representation learning methods, which depend directly on the target network's topology. However, this reliance on structural information raises privacy concerns and often leads to poor generalization across different networks. In this work, we address a key question: Can we design a node importance ranking model trained exclusively on synthetic networks that is effectively appliable to real-world networks, eliminating the need to rely on the topology of target networks and improving both practicality and generalizability? We answer this question affirmatively by proposing the Influence-aware Causal Autoencoder Network (ICAN), a novel framework that leverages causal representation learning to get robust, invariant node embeddings for cross-network ranking tasks. Firstly, ICAN introduces an influence-aware causal representation learning module within an autoencoder architecture to extract node embeddings that are causally related to node importance. Moreover, we introduce a causal ranking loss and design a unified optimization framework that jointly optimizes the reconstruction and ranking objectives, enabling mutual reinforcement between node representation learning and ranking optimization. This design allows ICAN, trained on synthetic networks, to generalize effectively across diverse real-world graphs. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ICAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both ranking accuracy and generalization capability."
2511.01928,"Human mobility generation in disaster scenarios plays a vital role in resource allocation, emergency response, and rescue coordination. During disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes, human mobility patterns often deviate from their normal states, which makes the task more challenging. However, existing works usually rely on limited data from a single city or specific disaster, significantly restricting the model's generalization capability in new scenarios. In fact, disasters are highly sudden and unpredictable, and any city may encounter new types of disasters without prior experience. Therefore, we aim to develop a one-for-all model for mobility generation that can generalize to new disaster scenarios. However, building a universal framework faces two key challenges: 1) the diversity of disaster types and 2) the heterogeneity among different cities. In this work, we propose a unified model for human mobility generation in natural disasters (named UniDisMob). To enable cross-disaster generalization, we design physics-informed prompt and physics-guided alignment that leverage the underlying common patterns in mobility changes after different disasters to guide the generation process. To achieve cross-city generalization, we introduce a meta-learning framework that extracts universal patterns across multiple cities through shared parameters and captures city-specific features via private parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple cities and disaster scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average performance improvement exceeding 13%."
2511.02615,"Social media platforms increasingly rely on crowdsourced moderation systems like Community Notes to combat misinformation at scale. However, these systems face challenges from rater bias and potential manipulation, which may undermine their effectiveness. Here we systematically evaluate the Community Notes algorithm using simulated data that models realistic rater and note behaviors, quantifying error rates in publishing helpful versus unhelpful notes. We find that the algorithm suppresses a substantial fraction of genuinely helpful notes and is highly sensitive to rater biases, including polarization and in-group preferences. Moreover, a small minority (5--20\%) of bad raters can strategically suppress targeted helpful notes, effectively censoring reliable information. These findings suggest that while community-driven moderation may offer scalability, its vulnerability to bias and manipulation raises concerns about reliability and trustworthiness, highlighting the need for improved mechanisms to safeguard the integrity of crowdsourced fact-checking."
2511.02663,"We investigate feedback mechanisms in political communication by testing whether politicians adapt the sentiment of their messages in response to public engagement. Using over 1.5 million tweets from Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom, Spain, and Greece during 2021, we identify sentiment dynamics through a simple yet interpretable linear model. The analysis reveals a closed-loop behavior: engagement with positive and negative messages influences the sentiment of subsequent posts. Moreover, the learned coefficients highlight systematic differences across political roles: opposition members are more reactive to negative engagement, whereas government officials respond more to positive signals. These results provide a quantitative, control-oriented view of behavioral adaptation in online politics, showing how feedback principles can explain the self-reinforcing dynamics that emerge in social media discourse."
2511.03016,"Crowdsourced data supports real-time decision-making but faces challenges like misinformation, errors, and contributor power concentration. This study systematically examines trust management practices across platforms categorised as Volunteered Geographic Information, Wiki Ecosystems, Social Media, Mobile Crowdsensing, and Specialised Review and Environmental Crowdsourcing. Identified strengths include automated moderation and community validation, while limitations involve rapid data influx, niche oversight gaps, opaque trust metrics, and elite dominance. Proposed solutions incorporate advanced AI tools, transparent reputation metrics, decentralised moderation, structured community engagement, and a ``soft power'' strategy, aiming to equitably distribute decision-making authority and enhance overall data reliability."
2511.03378,"Despite the importance of social science knowledge for various stakeholders, measuring its diffusion into different domains remains a challenge. This study uses a novel text-based approach to measure the idea-level diffusion of social science knowledge from the research domain to the journalism and policy-making domains. By doing so, we expand the detection of knowledge diffusion beyond the measurements of direct references. Our study focuses on media effects theories as key research ideas in the field of communication science. Using 72,703 documents (2000-2019) from three domains (i.e., research, journalism, and policy-making) that mention these ideas, we count the mentions of these ideas in each domain, estimate their domain-specific contexts, and track and compare differences across domains and over time. Overall, we find that diffusion patterns and dynamics vary considerably between ideas, with some ideas diffusing between other domains, while others do not. Based on the embedding regression approach, we compare contextualized meanings across domains and find that the distances between research and policy are typically larger than between research and journalism. We also find that ideas largely shift roles across domains - from being the theories themselves in research to sense-making in news to applied, administrative use in policy. Over time, we observe semantic convergence mainly for ideas that are practically oriented. Our results characterize the cross-domain diffusion patterns and dynamics of social science knowledge at the idea level, and we discuss the implications for measuring knowledge diffusion beyond citations."
2511.03608,"Eigenvector centrality is an established measure of global connectivity, from which the importance and influence of nodes can be inferred. We introduce a local eigenvector centrality that incorporates both local and global connectivity. This new measure references prominent eigengaps and combines their associated eigenspectrum, via the Euclidean norm, to detect centrality that reflects the influence of prominent community structures. In contact networks, with clearly defined community structures, local eigenvector centrality is shown to identify similar but distinct distributions to eigenvector centrality applied on each community in isolation and PageRank. Discrepancies between the two eigenvector measures highlight nodes and communities that do not conform to their defined local structures, e.g. nodes with more connections outside of their defined community than within it. While reference to PageRank's centrality assessment enables a mitigation strategy for localisation effects inherent in eigenvector-based measures. In networks without clearly defined communities, such as city road networks, local eigenvector centrality is shown to identify both locally prominent and globally connected hubs."
2511.04453,"Social news platforms have become key launch outlets for open-source projects, especially Hacker News (HN), though quantifying their immediate impact remains challenging. This paper presents a reproducible demonstration system that tracks how HN exposure translates into GitHub star growth for AI and LLM tools. Built entirely on public APIs, our pipeline analyzes 138 repository launches from 2024-2025 and reveals substantial launch effects: repositories gain an average of 121 stars within 24 hours, 189 stars within 48 hours, and 289 stars within a week of HN exposure. Through machine learning models (Elastic Net) and non-linear approaches (Gradient Boosting), we identify key predictors of viral growth. Posting timing appears as key factor--launching at optimal hours can mean hundreds of additional stars--while the ""Show HN"" tag shows no statistical advantage after controlling for other factors. The demonstration completes in under five minutes on standard hardware, automatically collecting data, training models, and generating visualizations through single-file scripts. This makes our findings immediately reproducible and the framework easily be extended to other platforms, providing both researchers and developers with actionable insights into launch dynamics."
2511.04697,"Disinformation campaigns can distort public perception and destabilize institutions. Understanding how different populations respond to information is crucial for designing effective interventions, yet real-world experimentation is impractical and ethically challenging. To address this, we develop an agent-based simulation using Large Language Models (LLMs) to model responses to misinformation. We construct agent personas spanning five professions and three mental schemas, and evaluate their reactions to news headlines. Our findings show that LLM-generated agents align closely with ground-truth labels and human predictions, supporting their use as proxies for studying information responses. We also find that mental schemas, more than professional background, influence how agents interpret misinformation. This work provides a validation of LLMs to be used as agents in an agent-based model of an information network for analyzing trust, polarization, and susceptibility to deceptive content in complex social systems."
2511.04702,"We consider the problem of communication-constrained collaborative personalized mean estimation under a privacy constraint in an environment of several agents continuously receiving data according to arbitrary unknown agent-specific distributions. A consensus-based algorithm is studied under the framework of differential privacy in order to protect each agent's data. We give a theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed consensus-based algorithm for any bounded unknown distributions on the agents' data, showing that collaboration provides faster convergence than a fully local approach where agents do not share data, under an oracle decision rule and under some restrictions on the privacy level and the agents' connectivity, which illustrates the benefit of private collaboration in an online setting under a communication restriction on the agents. The theoretical faster-than-local convergence guarantee is backed up by several numerical results."
2511.04712,"Identifying locally dense communities closely connected to the user-initiated query node is crucial for a wide range of applications. Existing approaches either solely depend on rule-based constraints or exclusively utilize deep learning technologies to identify target communities. Therefore, an important question is proposed: can deep learning be integrated with rule-based constraints to elevate the quality of community search? In this paper, we affirmatively address this question by introducing a novel approach called Neural Community Search via Attribute-augmented Conductance, abbreviated as NCSAC. Specifically, NCSAC first proposes a novel concept of attribute-augmented conductance, which harmoniously blends the (internal and external) structural proximity and the attribute similarity. Then, NCSAC extracts a coarse candidate community of satisfactory quality using the proposed attribute-augmented conductance. Subsequently, NCSAC frames the community search as a graph optimization task, refining the candidate community through sophisticated reinforcement learning techniques, thereby producing high-quality results. Extensive experiments on six real-world graphs and ten competitors demonstrate the superiority of our solutions in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. Notably, the proposed solution outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an impressive F1-score improvement ranging from 5.3\% to 42.4\%.

2511.05122,"Centrality is a fundamental concept in network science, providing critical insights into the structure and dynamics of complex systems such as social, transportation, biological and financial networks. Despite its extensive use, there is no universally accepted definition of centrality, leading to the development of a vast array of distinct centrality measures. These measures have grown so numerous that they resemble a 'zoo', each representing a unique approach to capturing node importance within a network. However, the increasing number of metrics being developed has led to several challenges, including issues of discoverability, redundancy, naming conflicts, validation and accessibility. This work aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive catalog of over 400 centrality measures, along with clear descriptions and references to original sources. While not exhaustive, this compilation represents the most extensive and systematic effort to date in organizing and presenting centrality measures. We also encourage readers to explore and contribute to the Centrality Zoo website atthis https URL, which provides an interactive platform for discovering, comparing and implementing centrality measures."
2511.05729,"Social media platforms have become pivotal for projecting national identity and soft power in an increasingly digital world. This study examines the digital manifestation of Taiwanese gastrodiplomacy by focusing on bubble tea -- a culturally iconic beverage -- leveraging a dataset comprising 107,169 posts from the popular lifestyle social media platform Instagram. Including 315,279,227 engagements, 4,756,320 comments, and 8,097,260,651 views over five full years (2020-2024), we investigate how social media facilitates discussion about Taiwanese cuisine and contributes to Taiwan's digital soft power. Our analysis reveals that bubble tea consistently emerges as the dominant representation of Taiwanese cuisine across Meta's Instagram channels. However, this dominance also indicates vulnerability in gastrodiplomatic strategy compared to other countries. Additionally, we find evidence that Instagram suppresses bubble tea posts mentioning Taiwan by 1,200% -- roughly a twelve-fold decrease in exposure -- relative to posts without such mentions. Crucially, we observe a significant drop in the number of posts, views, and engagement following Lai's inauguration in May 2024. This study ultimately contributes to understanding how digital platforms can enable or disable gastrodiplomacy, soft power, and cultural diplomacy while highlighting the need for greater algorithmic transparency. By noting Taiwan's bubble tea's digital engagement and footprint, critical insights are brought for nations seeking to leverage soft power through gastronomic means in a politicized digital era and researchers trying to better understand algorithmic suppression."
2511.0588,"With the rapid advancement of digitization and intelligence, enterprise big data processing platforms have become increasingly important in data management. However, traditional monolithic architectures, due to their high coupling, are unable to cope with increasingly complex demands in the face of business expansion and increased data volume, resulting in limited platform scalability and decreased data collection efficiency. This article proposes a solution for enterprise big data processing platform based on microservice architecture, based on the concept of Domain Driven Design (DDD). Through in-depth analysis of business requirements, the functional and non functional requirements of the platform in various scenarios were determined, and the DDD method was used to decompose the core business logic into independent microservice modules, enabling data collection, parsing, cleaning, and visualization functions to be independently developed, deployed, and upgraded, thereby improving the flexibility and scalability of the system. This article also designs an automated data collection process based on microservices and proposes an improved dynamic scheduling algorithm to efficiently allocate data collection tasks to Docker nodes, and monitor the collection progress and service status in real time to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of data collection. Through the implementation and testing of the platform, it has been verified that the enterprise big data processing platform based on microservice architecture has significantly improved scalability, data quality, and collection efficiency."
2511.05891,"The current surge in supply chain finance has significantly alleviated the ""capital challenges"" faced by domestic related enterprises, enabling enterprises upstream and subsequent stages of the industrial chain to achieve effective circulation of financing services in the supply chain based on the credit of core enterprises. By gathering essential information from the heart of the supply chain, supply chain financing enables efficient resource distribution and aids all stakeholders in making well-informed choices. However, supply chain finance in China still faces numerous obstacles, such as information asymmetry and inefficient credit transmission chains, hindering its long-term development. This paper designs an operational framework for supply chain finance incorporating blockchain technology, clearly defines the participating entities, and analyzes their business relationships. Based upon evolutionary game theory, a supply chain finance financing game model incorporating blockchain technology is constructed. A comparative analysis of the model's equilibrium points and their stability is conducted. The choices of evolutionary equilibrium strategies adopted by small and medium-sized enterprises, key players, and financing entities within this framework are explored, and the influence of blockchain technology on the prerequisites for completing supply chain finance transactions is investigated."
2511.05899,"Under the market background of increasingly personalized product demand and compressed response cycle, the traditional manufacturing model with standardized mass production as the core has been difficult to meet the dual expectations of customers for differentiation and fast delivery. In order to improve the efficiency of resource allocation and market response, automobile manufacturers need to build a production system that takes into account cost and flexibility. Based on the delayed response manufacturing strategy, this study built an order response node configuration model suitable for automotive manufacturing scenarios, focusing on the positioning of order driven intervention points in the production process. The model comprehensively considers the structural cost changes brought by process adjustment, the dynamic characteristics of the changes of unit manufacturing cost and intermediate inventory cost at different stages with the location of nodes, and introduces delivery time constraints to embed time factors into the inventory decision logic to enhance the practicality of the model and the adaptation of realistic constraints. In terms of solution methods, this paper adopts function fitting and simulation analysis methods, combined with mathematical modeling tools, systematically describes the change trend of total cost, and verifies the rationality and effectiveness of the model structure and solution through actual enterprise cases. The research results provide a theoretical basis and decision support for automobile manufacturing enterprises to realize the synergy of flexible production and cost control in the environment of variable demand, and also provide an empirical reference for the implementation path and system optimization of subsequent relevant strategies."
2511.05904,"As an important source of small molecule drugs, natural products show remarkable biological activities with their rich types and unique structures. However, due to the limited number of samples and structural complexity, the rapid discovery of lead compounds is limited. Therefore, in this study, natural inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) and Phosphodiesterase 7 (PDE7) were screened by combining computer aided drug design (CADD) technology and deep learning method, and their activities were verified by enzyme activity experiment and enzymo-linked immunoassay. These two enzymes have important application potential in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, but PDE4 inhibitors may cause adverse reactions, so it is particularly important to develop both effective and safe dual-target inhibitors. In addition, as a potential target of hyperuricemia, the development of natural inhibitors of xanthine oxidase (X0) is also of great value. We used pharmacophore technology for virtual screening, combined with molecular docking technology to improve accuracy, and finally selected 16 potential natural inhibitors of PDE4/7, and verified their binding stability through molecular dynamics simulation. The results of this study laid a foundation for establishing an efficient dual-target inhibitor screening system and exploring the lead compounds of novel X0 inhibitors."
2511.06091,"Climate change poses a global threat to public health, food security, and economic stability. Addressing it requires evidence-based policies and a nuanced understanding of how the threat is perceived by the public, particularly within visual social media, where narratives quickly evolve through voices of individuals, politicians, NGOs, and institutions. This study investigates climate-related discourse on YouTube within the Brazilian context, a geopolitically significant nation in global environmental negotiations. Through three case studies, we examine (1) which psychological content traits most effectively drive audience engagement, (2) the extent to which these traits influence content popularity, and (3) whether such insights can inform the design of persuasive synthetic campaigns--such as climate denialism--using recent generative language models. Another contribution of this work is the release of a large publicly available dataset of 226K Brazilian YouTube videos and 2.7M user comments on climate change. The dataset includes fine-grained annotations of persuasive strategies, theory-of-mind categorizations in user responses, and typologies of content creators. This resource can help support future research on digital climate communication and the ethical risk of algorithmically amplified narratives and generative media."
2511.066,"This paper introduces HyperEF 2.0, a scalable framework for spectral coarsening and clustering of large-scale hypergraphs through hyperedge effective resistances, aiming to decompose hypergraphs into multiple node clusters with a small number of inter-cluster hyperedges. Building on the recent HyperEF framework, our approach offers three primary contributions. Specifically, first, by leveraging the expanded Krylov subspace exploiting both clique and star expansions of hyperedges, we can significantly improve the approximation accuracy of effective resistances. Second, we propose a resistance-based local clustering scheme for merging small isolated nodes into nearby clusters, yielding more balanced clusters with substantially improved conductance. Third, the proposed HyperEF 2.0 enables the integration of resistance-based hyperedge weighting and community detection into a multilevel hypergraph partitioning tool, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments on real-world VLSI benchmarks show that HyperEF 2.0 can more effectively coarsen hypergraphs without compromising their structural properties, while delivering much better solution quality (e.g. conductance) than the state-of-the-art hypergraph coarsening methods, such as HyperEF and HyperSF. Moreover, compared to leading hypergraph partitioners such as hMETIS, SpecPart, MedPart, and KaHyPar, our framework consistently achieves smaller cut sizes. In terms of runtime, HyperEF 2.0 attains up to a 4.5x speedup over the latest flow-based local clustering algorithm, HyperSF, demonstrating both superior efficiency and partitioning quality."
2511.06747,"The structure of road networks plays a pivotal role in shaping transportation dynamics. It also provides insights into how drivers experience city streets and helps uncover each urban environment's unique characteristics and challenges. Consequently, characterizing cities based on their road network patterns can facilitate the identification of similarities and differences, informing collaborative traffic management strategies, particularly at a regional scale. While previous studies have investigated global network patterns for cities, they have often overlooked detailed characterizations within a single large urban region. Additionally, most existing research uses metrics like degree, centrality, orientation, etc., and misses the nuances of street networks at the intersection level, specifically the geometric angles formed by links at intersections, which could offer a more refined feature for characterization. To address these gaps, this study examines over 100 cities in the San Francisco Bay Area. We introduce a novel metric for classifying intersections, distinguishing between different types of 3-way and 4-way intersections based on the angles formed at the intersections. Through the application of clustering algorithms in machine learning, we have identified three distinct typologies - grid, orthogonal, and organic cities - within the San Francisco Bay Area. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the metric in capturing the differences between cities based on street and intersection patterns. The typologies generated in this study could offer valuable support for city planners and policymakers in crafting a range of practical strategies tailored to the complexities of each city's road network, covering aspects such as evacuation plans, traffic signage placements, and traffic signal control."
2511.06982,"Link prediction is a pivotal task in graph mining with wide-ranging applications in social networks, recommendation systems, and knowledge graph completion. However, many leading Graph Neural Network (GNN) models often neglect the valuable semantic information aggregated at the class level. To address this limitation, this paper introduces CGLE (Class-label Graph Link Estimator), a novel framework designed to augment GNN-based link prediction models. CGLE operates by constructing a class-conditioned link probability matrix, where each entry represents the probability of a link forming between two node classes. This matrix is derived from either available ground-truth labels or from pseudo-labels obtained through clustering. The resulting class-based prior is then concatenated with the structural link embedding from a backbone GNN, and the combined representation is processed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the final prediction. Crucially, CGLE's logic is encapsulated in an efficient preprocessing stage, leaving the computational complexity of the underlying GNN model unaffected. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a broad suite of benchmark datasets, covering both homophilous and sparse heterophilous graphs. The results show that CGLE yields substantial performance gains over strong baselines such as NCN and NCNC, with improvements in HR@100 of over 10 percentage points on homophilous datasets like Pubmed and DBLP. On sparse heterophilous graphs, CGLE delivers an MRR improvement of over 4% on the Chameleon dataset. Our work underscores the efficacy of integrating global, data-driven semantic priors, presenting a compelling alternative to the pursuit of increasingly complex model architectures. Code to reproduce our findings is available at:this https URL."
2511.07157,"In this paper, we introduce past-aware game-theoretic centrality, a class of centrality measures that captures the collaborative contribution of nodes in a network, accounting for both uncertain and certain collaborators. A general framework for computing standard game-theoretic centrality is extended to the past-aware case. As an application, we develop a new heuristic for different versions of the influence maximization problems in complex contagion dynamics, which models processes requiring reinforcement from multiple neighbors to spread. A computationally efficient explicit formula for the corresponding past-aware centrality score is derived, leading to scalable algorithms for identifying the most influential nodes, which in most cases outperform the standard greedy approach in both efficiency and solution quality."
