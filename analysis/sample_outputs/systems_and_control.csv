2501.10447,"Control barrier function (CBF)-based methods provide the minimum modification necessary to formally guarantee safety in the context of quadratic programming, and strict safety guarantee for safety critical systems. However, most CBF-related derivatives myopically focus on present safety at each time step, a reasoning over a look-ahead horizon is exactly missing. In this paper, a predictive safety matrix is constructed. We then consolidate the safety condition based on the smallest eigenvalue of the proposed safety matrix. A predefined deconfliction strategy of motion paths is embedded into the trajectory tracking module to manage deadlock conflicts, which computes the deadlock escape velocity with the minimum attitude angle. Comparison results show that the introduction of the predictive term is robust for measurement uncertainty and is immune to oscillations. The proposed deadlock avoidance method avoids a large detour, without obvious stagnation."
