2501.16457,"The 2025 ISSAC conference in Guanajuato, Mexico, marks the 50th event in this significant series, making it an ideal moment to reflect on the field's history. This paper reviews the formative years of symbolic computation up to 1975, fifty years ago. By revisiting a period unfamiliar to most current participants, this survey aims to shed light on once-pressing issues that are now largely resolved and to highlight how some of today's challenges were recognized earlier than expected."
2503.05767,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone remarkable development since the mid-2000s, particularly in the fields of machine learning and deep learning, driven by the explosive growth of large databases and computational capacity. Hungarian researchers recognized the significance of AI early on, actively participating in international research and achieving significant results in both theoretical and practical domains. This article presents some key achievements in Hungarian AI research. It highlights the results from the period before the rise of deep learning (the early 2010s), then discusses major theoretical advancements in Hungary after 2010. Finally, it provides a brief overview of AI-related applied scientific achievements from 2010 onward."
