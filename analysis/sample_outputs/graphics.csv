2501.01362,"Complex geometric tasks such as geometric modeling, physical simulation, and texture parametrization often involve the embedding of many complex sub-domains with potentially different dimensions. These tasks often require evolving the geometry and topology of the discretizations of these sub-domains, and guaranteeing a \emph{consistent} overall embedding for the multiplicity of sub-domains is required to define boundary conditions. We propose a data structure and algorithmic framework for hierarchically encoding a collection of meshes, enabling topological and geometric changes to be automatically propagated with coherent correspondences between them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in surface mesh decimation while preserving UV seams, periodic 2D/3D meshing, and extending the TetWild algorithm to ensure topology preservation of the embedded structures."
2501.01382,"The head-mounted display is a vital component of augmented reality, incorporating optics with complex display and see-through optical behavior. Computationally modeling these optical behaviors requires meeting three key criteria: accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility. In recent years, various approaches have been proposed to model display and see-through optics, which can broadly be classified into black-box and white-box models. However, both categories face significant limitations that hinder their adoption in commercial applications. To overcome these challenges, we leveraged prior knowledge of ray bundle properties outside the optical hardware and proposed a novel bundle-fit-based model. In this approach, the ray paths within the optics are treated as a black box, while a lightweight optimization problem is solved to fit the ray bundle outside the optics. This method effectively addresses the accuracy issues of black-box models and the accessibility challenges of white-box models. Although our model involves runtime optimization, this is typically not a concern, as it can use the solution from a previous query to initialize the optimization for the current query. We evaluated the performance of our proposed method through both simulations and experiments on real hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness."
2501.01628,"3D visualization and rendering in HPC are very heterogenous applications, though fundamentally the tasks involved are well-defined and do not differ much from application to application. The Khronos Group's ANARI standard seeks to consolidate 3D rendering across sci-vis applications. This paper makes an effort to convey challenges of 3D rendering and visualization with ANARI in the context of HPC, where the data does not fit within a single node or GPU but must be distributed. It also provides a gentle introduction to parallel rendering concepts and challenges to practitioners from the field of HPC in general. Finally, we present a case study showcasing data parallel rendering on the new supercomputer RAMSES at the University of Cologne."
2501.02003,"Unlike their line-based counterparts, surface-based techniques have yet to be thoroughly investigated in flow visualization due to their significant placement, speed, perception, and evaluation challenges. This paper presents SurfPatch, a novel framework supporting exploratory stream surface visualization. To begin with, we translate the issue of surface placement to surface selection and trace a large number of stream surfaces from a given flow field dataset. Then, we introduce a three-stage process: vertex-level classification, patch-level matching, and surface-level clustering that hierarchically builds the connection between vertices and patches and between patches and surfaces. This bottom-up approach enables fine-grained, multiscale patch-level matching, sharply contrasts surface-level matching offered by existing works, and provides previously unavailable flexibility during querying. We design an intuitive visual interface for users to conveniently visualize and analyze the underlying collection of stream surfaces in an exploratory manner. SurfPatch is not limited to stream surfaces traced from steady flow datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on stream surfaces produced from steady and unsteady flows as well as isosurfaces extracted from scalar fields.

2501.04648,"Interior design involves the careful selection and arrangement of objects to create an aesthetically pleasing, functional, and harmonized space that aligns with the client's design brief. This task is particularly challenging, as a successful design must not only incorporate all the necessary objects in a cohesive style, but also ensure they are arranged in a way that maximizes accessibility, while adhering to a variety of affordability and usage considerations. Data-driven solutions have been proposed, but these are typically room- or domain-specific and lack explainability in their design design considerations used in producing the final layout. In this paper, we investigate if large language models (LLMs) can be directly utilized for interior design. While we find that LLMs are not yet capable of generating complete layouts, they can be effectively leveraged in a structured manner, inspired by the workflow of interior designers. By systematically probing LLMs, we can reliably generate a list of objects along with relevant constraints that guide their placement. We translate this information into a design layout graph, which is then solved using an off-the-shelf constrained optimization setup to generate the final layouts. We benchmark our algorithm in various design configurations against existing LLM-based methods and human designs, and evaluate the results using a variety of quantitative and qualitative metrics along with user studies. In summary, we demonstrate that LLMs, when used in a structured manner, can effectively generate diverse high-quality layouts, making them a viable solution for creating large-scale virtual scenes.

2501.04744,"The calculation of the volume enclosed by curved surfaces discretized into triangular elements, and a cube is of great importance in different domains, such as computer graphics and multiphase flow simulations. We propose a robust algorithm, the Front2VOF (F2V) algorithm, to address this problem. The F2V algorithm consists of two main steps. First, it identifies the polygons within the cube by segmenting the triangular elements on the surface, retaining only the portions inside the cube boundaries. Second, it computes the volume enclosed by these polygons in combination with the cube faces. To validate the algorithm's accuracy and robustness, we tested it using a range of synthetic configurations with known analytical solutions."
2501.05009,"Oceanographers rely on visual analysis to interpret model simulations, identify events and phenomena, and track dynamic ocean processes. The ever increasing resolution and complexity of ocean data due to its dynamic nature and multivariate relationships demands a scalable and adaptable visualization tool for interactive exploration. We introduce pyParaOcean, a scalable and interactive visualization system designed specifically for ocean data analysis. pyParaOcean offers specialized modules for common oceanographic analysis tasks, including eddy identification and salinity movement tracking. These modules seamlessly integrate with ParaView as filters, ensuring a user-friendly and easy-to-use system while leveraging the parallelization capabilities of ParaView and a plethora of inbuilt general-purpose visualization functionalities. The creation of an auxiliary dataset stored as a Cinema database helps address I/O and network bandwidth bottlenecks while supporting the generation of quick overview visualizations. We present a case study on the Bay of Bengal (BoB) to demonstrate the utility of the system and scaling studies to evaluate the efficiency of the system."
2501.07478,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels at producing highly detailed 3D reconstructions, but these scenes often require specialised renderers for effective visualisation. In contrast, point clouds are a widely used 3D representation and are compatible with most popular 3D processing software, yet converting 3DGS scenes into point clouds is a complex challenge. In this work we introduce 3DGS-to-PC, a flexible and highly customisable framework that is capable of transforming 3DGS scenes into dense, high-accuracy point clouds. We sample points probabilistically from each Gaussian as a 3D density function. We additionally threshold new points using the Mahalanobis distance to the Gaussian centre, preventing extreme outliers. The result is a point cloud that closely represents the shape encoded into the 3D Gaussian scene. Individual Gaussians use spherical harmonics to adapt colours depending on view, and each point may contribute only subtle colour hints to the resulting rendered scene. To avoid spurious or incorrect colours that do not fit with the final point cloud, we recalculate Gaussian colours via a customised image rendering approach, assigning each Gaussian the colour of the pixel to which it contributes most across all views. 3DGS-to-PC also supports mesh generation through Poisson Surface Reconstruction, applied to points sampled from predicted surface Gaussians. This allows coloured meshes to be generated from 3DGS scenes without the need for re-training. This package is highly customisable and capability of simple integration into existing 3DGS pipelines. 3DGS-to-PC provides a powerful tool for converting 3DGS data into point cloud and surface-based formats."
2501.07582,"The objective of polarization rendering is to simulate the interaction of light with materials exhibiting polarization-dependent behavior. However, integrating polarization into rendering is challenging and increases computational costs significantly. The primary difficulty lies in efficiently modeling and computing the complex reflection phenomena associated with polarized light. Specifically, frequency-domain analysis, essential for efficient environment lighting and storage of complex light interactions, is lacking. To efficiently simulate and reproduce polarized light interactions using frequency-domain techniques, we address the challenge of maintaining continuity in polarized light transport represented by Stokes vectors within angular domains. The conventional spherical harmonics method cannot effectively handle continuity and rotation invariance for Stokes vectors. To overcome this, we develop a new method called polarized spherical harmonics (PSH) based on the spin-weighted spherical harmonics theory. Our method provides a rotation-invariant representation of Stokes vector fields. Furthermore, we introduce frequency domain formulations of polarized rendering equations and spherical convolution based on PSH. We first define spherical convolution on Stokes vector fields in the angular domain, and it also provides efficient computation of polarized light transport, nearly on an entry-wise product in the frequency domain. Our frequency domain formulation, including spherical convolution, led to the development of the first real-time polarization rendering technique under polarized environmental illumination, named precomputed polarized radiance transfer, using our polarized spherical harmonics. Results demonstrate that our method can effectively and accurately simulate and reproduce polarized light interactions in complex reflection phenomena."
2501.0837,"Differentiable 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as an efficient and flexible rendering technique for representing complex scenes from a collection of 2D views and enabling high-quality real-time novel-view synthesis. However, its reliance on photometric losses can lead to imprecisely reconstructed geometry and extracted meshes, especially in regions with high curvature or fine detail. We propose a novel regularization method using the gradients of a signed distance function estimated from the Gaussians, to improve the quality of rendering while also extracting a surface mesh. The regularizing normal supervision facilitates better rendering and mesh reconstruction, which is crucial for downstream applications in video generation, animation, AR-VR and gaming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on datasets such as Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep-Blending. Our method scores higher on photorealism metrics compared to other mesh extracting rendering methods without compromising mesh quality."
2501.08736,"We present Holoview, an augmented reality (AR) system designed to support immersive and interactive learning of human anatomy. Holoview enables users to dynamically explore volumetric anatomical data through intuitive hand gestures in a 3D AR environment, allowing inspection of individual organs and cross-sectional views via clipping and bioscope features. The system adopts a lightweight client-server architecture optimized for real-time performance on the HoloLens through hybrid and foveated rendering. Our user study demonstrated Holoview's educational effectiveness, with participants showing a 135 percent improvement in task-specific knowledge and reporting increased confidence in understanding anatomical structures. The system was perceived as engaging and intuitive, particularly for organ selection and cross-sectional exploration, with low cognitive load and increasing ease of use over time. These findings highlight Holoview's potential to enhance anatomy learning through immersive, user-centered AR experiences."
2501.10474,"Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction, especially through neural rendering approaches like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Plenoxel, have led to high-quality 3D visualizations. However, these methods are optimized for digital environments and employ view-dependent color models (RGB) and 2D splatting techniques, which do not translate well to physical 3D printing. This paper introduces ""Poxel"", which stands for Printable-Voxel, a voxel-based 3D reconstruction framework optimized for photopolymer jetting 3D printing, which allows for high-resolution, full-color 3D models using a CMYKWCl color model. Our framework directly outputs printable voxel grids by removing view-dependency and converting the digital RGB color space to a physical CMYKWCl color space suitable for multi-material jetting. The proposed system achieves better fidelity and quality in printed models, aligning with the requirements of physical 3D objects."
2501.12119,"We present ENTIRE, a novel approach for volume rendering time prediction. Time-dependent volume data from simulations or experiments typically comprise complex deforming structures across hundreds or thousands of time steps, which in addition to the camera configuration has a significant impact on rendering performance. We first extract a feature vector from a volume that captures its structure that is relevant for rendering time performance. Then we combine this feature vector with further relevant parameters (e.g. camera setup), and with this perform the final prediction. Our experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate that our model is capable of efficiently achieving high prediction accuracy with fast response rates. We showcase ENTIRE's capability of enabling dynamic parameter adaptation for stable frame rates and load balancing in two case studies."
2501.12581,"The increasing demand for larger and higher fidelity simulations has made Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) and unstructured mesh techniques essential to focus compute effort and memory cost on just the areas of interest in the simulation domain. The distribution of these meshes over the compute nodes is often determined by balancing compute, memory, and network costs, leading to distributions with jagged nonconvex boundaries that fit together much like puzzle pieces. It is expensive, and sometimes impossible, to re-partition the data posing a challenge for in situ and post hoc visualization as the data cannot be rendered using standard sort-last compositing techniques that require a convex and disjoint data partitioning. We present a new distributed volume rendering and compositing algorithm, Approximate Puzzlepiece Compositing, that enables fast and high-accuracy in-place rendering of AMR and unstructured meshes. Our approach builds on Moment-Based Ordered-Independent Transparency to achieve a scalable, order-independent compositing algorithm that requires little communication and does not impose requirements on the data partitioning. We evaluate the image quality and scalability of our approach on synthetic data and two large-scale unstructured meshes on HPC systems by comparing to state-of-the-art sort-last compositing techniques, highlighting our approach's minimal overhead at higher core counts. We demonstrate that Approximate Puzzlepiece Compositing provides a scalable, high-performance, and high-quality distributed rendering approach applicable to the complex data distributions encountered in large-scale CFD simulations."

2501.14068,"Cage-based deformation is a fundamental problem in geometry processing, where a cage, a user-specified boundary of a region, is used to deform the ambient space of a given mesh. Traditional 3D cages are typically composed of triangles and quads. While quads can represent non-planar regions when their four corners are not coplanar, they form ruled surfaces with straight isoparametric curves, which limits their ability to handle curved and high-curvature deformations. In this work, we extend the cage for curved boundaries using Bézier patches, enabling flexible and high-curvature deformations with only a few control points. The higher-order structure of the Bézier patch also allows for the creation of a more compact and precise curved cage for the input model. Based on Green's third identity, we derive the Green coordinates for the Bézier cage, achieving shape-preserving deformation with smooth surface boundaries. These coordinates are defined based on the vertex positions and normals of the Bézier control net. Given that the coordinates are approximately calculated through the Riemann summation, we propose a global projection technique to ensure that the coordinates accurately conform to the linear reproduction property. Experimental results show that our method achieves high performance in handling curved and high-curvature deformations."
2501.15258,"A ruled surface is a shape swept out by moving a line in 3D space. Due to their simple geometric forms, ruled surfaces have applications in various domains such as architecture and engineering. In the past, various approaches have been proposed to approximate a target shape using developable surfaces, which are special ruled surfaces with zero Gaussian curvature. However, methods for shape approximation using general ruled surfaces remain limited and often require the target shape to be either represented as parametric surfaces or have non-positive Gaussian curvature. In this paper, we propose a method to compute a piecewise ruled surface that approximates an arbitrary freeform mesh surface. We first use a group-sparsity formulation to optimize the given mesh shape into an approximately piecewise ruled form, in conjunction with a tangent vector field that indicates the ruling directions. Afterward, we utilize the optimization result to extract seams that separate smooth families of rulings, and use the seams to construct the initial rulings. Finally, we further optimize the positions and orientations of the rulings to improve the alignment with the input target shape. We apply our method to a variety of freeform shapes with different topologies and complexity, demonstrating its effectiveness in approximating arbitrary shapes."
2501.15279,"We derive closed-form expressions of biharmonic coordinates for 2D high-order cages, enabling the transformation of the input polynomial curves into polynomial curves of any order. Central to our derivation is the use of the high-order boundary element method. We demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our method on various 2D deformations. In practice, users can easily manipulate the Bezier control points to perform the desired intuitive deformation, as the biharmonic coordinates provide an enriched deformation space and encourage the alignment between the boundary cage and its interior geometry."
2501.1655,"Creating hand-drawn animation sequences is labor-intensive and demands professional expertise. We introduce PhysAnimator, a novel approach for generating physically plausible meanwhile anime-stylized animation from static anime illustrations. Our method seamlessly integrates physics-based simulations with data-driven generative models to produce dynamic and visually compelling animations. To capture the fluidity and exaggeration characteristic of anime, we perform image-space deformable body simulations on extracted mesh geometries. We enhance artistic control by introducing customizable energy strokes and incorporating rigging point support, enabling the creation of tailored animation effects such as wind interactions. Finally, we extract and warp sketches from the simulation sequence, generating a texture-agnostic representation, and employ a sketch-guided video diffusion model to synthesize high-quality animation frames. The resulting animations exhibit temporal consistency and visual plausibility, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in creating dynamic anime-style animations. See our project page for more demos:this https URL"
2501.17895,"Recent advances in generative modeling have driven significant progress in text-guided texture synthesis. However, current methods focus on synthesizing texture for single static 3D object, and struggle to handle entire families of shapes, such as those produced by procedural programs. Applying existing methods naively to each procedural shape is too slow to support exploring different parameter configurations at interactive rates, and also results in inconsistent textures across the procedural shapes. To this end, we introduce ProcTex, the first text-to-texture system designed for part-based procedural models. ProcTex enables consistent and real-time text-guided texture synthesis for families of shapes, which integrates seamlessly with the interactive design flow of procedural modeling. To ensure consistency, our core approach is to synthesize texture for a template shape from the procedural model, followed by a texture transfer stage to apply the texture to other procedural shapes via solving dense correspondence. To ensure interactiveness, we propose a novel correspondence network and show that dense correspondence can be effectively learned by a neural network for procedural models. We also develop several techniques, including a retexturing pipeline to support structural variation from procedural parameters, and part-level UV texture map generation for local appearance editing. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of procedural models validate ProcTex's ability to produce high-quality, visually consistent textures while supporting interactive applications."
2501.18152,"Recent point-based differentiable rendering techniques have achieved significant success in high-fidelity reconstruction and fast rendering. However, due to the unstructured nature of point-based representations, they are difficult to apply to modern graphics pipelines designed for structured meshes, as well as to a variety of simulation and editing algorithms that work well with structured mesh representations. To this end, we propose StructuredField, a novel representation that achieves both a structured geometric representation of the reconstructed object and high-fidelity rendering reconstruction. We employ structured tetrahedral meshes to represent the reconstructed object. We reparameterize the geometric attributes of these tetrahedra into the parameters of 3D Gaussian primitives, thereby enabling differentiable, high-fidelity rendering directly from the mesh. Furthermore, a hierarchical implicit subdivision strategy is utilized to ensure a conformal mesh structure while empowering the representation to capture multi-scale details. To maintain geometric integrity during optimization, we propose a novel inversion-free homeomorphism that constrains the tetrahedral mesh, guaranteeing it remains both inversion-free and self-intersection-free during the optimization process and in the final result. Based on our proposed StructuredField, we achieve high-quality structured meshes that are completely inversion-free and conformal, while also attaining reconstruction results comparable to those of 3DGS. We also demonstrate the applicability of our representation to various applications such as physical simulation, deformation, and level-of-detail."
2501.18627,"We present a fast and simple technique to convert images into a radiance surface-based scene representation. Building on existing radiance volume reconstruction algorithms, we introduce a subtle yet impactful modification of the loss function requiring changes to only a few lines of code: instead of integrating the radiance field along rays and supervising the resulting images, we project the training images into the scene to directly supervise the spatio-directional radiance field.The primary outcome of this change is the complete removal of alpha blending and ray marching from the image formation model, instead moving these steps into the loss computation. In addition to promoting convergence to surfaces, this formulation assigns explicit semantic meaning to 2D subsets of the radiance field, turning them into well-defined radiance surfaces. We finally extract a level set from this representation, which results in a high-quality radiance surface model.Our method retains much of the speed and quality of the baseline algorithm. For instance, a suitably modified variant of Instant NGP maintains comparable computational efficiency, while achieving an average PSNR that is only 0.1 dB lower. Most importantly, our method generates explicit surfaces in place of an exponential volume, doing so with a level of simplicity not seen in prior work."
2501.18672,"Recent advancements in 3D scene editing have been propelled by the rapid development of generative models. Existing methods typically utilize generative models to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture modifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a character's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control over the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to precisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region and the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of control points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing. DYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to establish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming suboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired editing regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling flexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided by control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect and quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

2502.00626,"Cutting thin-walled deformable structures is common in daily life, but poses significant challenges for simulation due to the introduced spatial discontinuities. Traditional methods rely on mesh-based domain representations, which require frequent remeshing and refinement to accurately capture evolving discontinuities. These challenges are further compounded in reduced-space simulations, where the basis functions are inherently geometry- and mesh-dependent, making it difficult or even impossible for the basis to represent the diverse family of discontinuities introduced by cuts.Recent advances in representing basis functions with neural fields offer a promising alternative, leveraging their discretization-agnostic nature to represent deformations across varying geometries. However, the inherent continuity of neural fields is an obstruction to generalization, particularly if discontinuities are encoded in neural network weights.We present Wind Lifter, a novel neural representation designed to accurately model complex cuts in thin-walled deformable structures. Our approach constructs neural fields that reproduce discontinuities precisely at specified locations, without baking in the position of the cut line. Crucially, our approach does not embed the discontinuity in the neural network's weights, opening avenues to generalization of cut placement.Our method achieves real-time simulation speeds and supports dynamic updates to cut line geometry during the simulation. Moreover, the explicit representation of discontinuities makes our neural field intuitive to control and edit, offering a significant advantage over traditional neural fields, where discontinuities are embedded within the network's weights, and enabling new applications that rely on general cut placement."
2502.01517,"The ability to accurately produce geometries with specified properties is perhaps the most important characteristic of a manufacturing process. 3D printing is marked by exceptional design freedom and complexity but is also prone to geometric and other defects that must be resolved for it to reach its full potential. Ultimately, this will require both astute design decisions and timely parameter adjustments to maintain stability that is challenging even with expert human operators. While machine learning is widely investigated in 3D printing, existing methods typically overlook spatial features that vary across prints and thus find it difficult to produce desired geometries. Here, we encode volumetric representations of printed parts into neural fields and apply a new regularization strategy, based on minimizing the partial derivative of the field's output with respect to a single, non-learnable parameter. By thus encouraging small input changes to yield only small output variations, we encourage smooth interpolation between observed volumes and hence realistic geometry predictions. This framework therefore allows the extraction of 'imagined' 3D shapes, revealing how a part would look if manufactured under previously unseen parameters. The resulting continuous field is used for data-driven optimization to maximize geometric fidelity between expected and produced geometries, reducing post-processing, material waste, and production costs. By optimizing process parameters dynamically, our approach enables advanced planning strategies, potentially allowing manufacturers to better realize complex and feature-rich designs."
2502.02011,"Displacement mapping is an important tool for modeling detailed geometric features. We explore the problem of authoring complex surfaces while ray tracing interactively. Current techniques for ray tracing displaced surfaces rely on acceleration structures that require dynamic rebuilding when edited. These techniques are typically used for massive static scenes or the compression of detailed source assets. Our interest lies in modeling and look development of artistic features with real-time ray tracing. We demonstrate projective displacement mapping, a direct sampling method without a bottom-level acceleration structure combined with a top-level hardware BVH. Quality and performance are improved over existing methods with smoothed displaced normals, thin feature sampling, tight prism bounds and ray-bilinear patch intersections. Our method is faster than comparable approaches for ray tracing, enabling real-time surface editing."
2502.02891,"Recent advances in implicit neural representations have made them a popular choice for modeling 3D geometry, achieving impressive results in tasks such as shape representation, reconstruction, and learning priors. However, directly editing these representations poses challenges due to the complex relationship between model weights and surface regions they influence. Among such editing tools, sculpting, which allows users to interactively carve or extrude the surface, is a valuable editing operation to the graphics and modeling community. While traditional mesh-based tools like ZBrush facilitate fast and intuitive edits, a comparable toolkit for sculpting neural SDFs is currently lacking. We introduce a framework that enables interactive surface sculpting edits directly on neural implicit representations. Unlike previous works limited to spot edits, our approach allows users to perform stroke-based modifications on the fly, ensuring intuitive shape manipulation without switching representations. By employing tubular neighborhoods to sample strokes and custom brush profiles, we achieve smooth deformations along user-defined curves, providing precise control over the sculpting process. Our method demonstrates that intricate and versatile edits can be made while preserving the smooth nature of implicit representations."
2502.05339,"We present a novel reduced-order fluid simulation technique leveraging Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to achieve fast, memory-efficient, and user-controllable subspace simulation. We demonstrate that our approach combines the strengths of both spatial reduced order models (ROMs) as well as spectral decompositions. By optimizing for the operator that evolves a system state from one timestep to the next, rather than the system state itself, we gain both the compressive power of spatial ROMs as well as the intuitive physical dynamics of spectral methods. The latter property is of particular interest in graphics applications, where user control of fluid phenomena is of high demand. We demonstrate this in various applications including spatial and temporal modulation tools and fluid upscaling with added turbulence.We adapt DMD for graphics applications by reducing computational overhead, incorporating user-defined force inputs, and optimizing memory usage with randomized SVD. The integration of OptDMD and DMD with Control (DMDc) facilitates noise-robust reconstruction and real-time user interaction. We demonstrate the technique's robustness across diverse simulation scenarios, including artistic editing, time-reversal, and super-resolution.Through experimental validation on challenging scenarios, such as colliding vortex rings and boundary-interacting plumes, our method also exhibits superior performance and fidelity with significantly fewer basis functions compared to existing spatial ROMs. The inherent linearity of the DMD operator enables unique application modes, such as time-reversible fluid simulation. This work establishes another avenue for developing real-time, high-quality fluid simulations, enriching the space of fluid simulation techniques in interactive graphics and animation."

2502.06053,"Visualizing a large-scale volumetric dataset with high resolution is challenging due to the substantial computational time and space complexity. Recent deep learning-based image inpainting methods significantly improve rendering latency by reconstructing a high-resolution image for visualization in constant time on GPU from a partially rendered image where only a portion of pixels go through the expensive rendering pipeline. However, existing solutions need to render every pixel of either a predefined regular sampling pattern or an irregular sample pattern predicted from a low-resolution image rendering. Both methods require a significant amount of expensive pixel-level rendering. In this work, we provide Importance Mask Learning (IML) and Synthesis (IMS) networks, which are the first attempts to directly synthesize important regions of the regular sampling pattern from the user's view parameters, to further minimize the number of pixels to render by jointly considering the dataset, user behavior, and the downstream reconstruction neural network. Our solution is a unified framework to handle various types of inpainting methods through the proposed differentiable compaction/decompaction layers. Experiments show our method can further improve the overall rendering latency of state-of-the-art volume visualization methods using reconstruction neural network for free when rendering scientific volumetric datasets. Our method can also directly optimize the off-the-shelf pre-trained reconstruction neural networks without elongated retraining."
2502.06093,"Manufacturability is vital for product design and production, with accessibility being a key element, especially in subtractive manufacturing. Traditional methods for geometric accessibility analysis are time-consuming and struggle with scalability, while existing deep learning approaches in manufacturability analysis often neglect geometric challenges in accessibility and are limited to specific model types. In this paper, we introduce DeepMill, the first neural framework designed to accurately and efficiently predict inaccessible and occlusion regions under varying machining tool parameters, applicable to both CAD and freeform models. To address the challenges posed by cutter collisions and the lack of extensive training datasets, we construct a cutter-aware dual-head octree-based convolutional neural network (O-CNN) and generate an inaccessible and occlusion regions analysis dataset with a variety of cutter sizes for network training. Experiments demonstrate that DeepMill achieves 94.7% accuracy in predicting inaccessible regions and 88.7% accuracy in identifying occlusion regions, with an average processing time of 0.04 seconds for complex geometries. Based on the outcomes, DeepMill implicitly captures both local and global geometric features, as well as the complex interactions between cutters and intricate 3D models."

2502.06897,"Archaeological pottery documentation traditionally requires a time-consuming manual process of converting pencil sketches into publication-ready inked drawings. I present PyPotteryInk, an open-source automated pipeline that transforms archaeological pottery sketches into standardised publication-ready drawings using a one-step diffusion model. Built on a modified img2img-turbo architecture, the system processes drawings in a single forward pass while preserving crucial morphological details and maintaining archaeologic documentation standards and analytical value. The model employs an efficient patch-based approach with dynamic overlap, enabling high-resolution output regardless of input drawing size. I demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a dataset of Italian protohistoric pottery drawings, where it successfully captures both fine details like decorative patterns and structural elements like vessel profiles or handling elements. Expert evaluation confirms that the generated drawings meet publication standards while significantly reducing processing time from hours to seconds per drawing. The model can be fine-tuned to adapt to different archaeological contexts with minimal training data, making it versatile across various pottery documentation styles.

2502.07754,"Gaussian Splatting (GS) is a recent and pivotal technique in 3D computer graphics. GS-based algorithms almost always bypass classical methods such as ray tracing, which offers numerous inherent advantages for rendering. For example, ray tracing is able to handle incoherent rays for advanced lighting effects, including shadows and reflections. To address this limitation, we introduce MeshSplats, a method which converts GS to a mesh-like format. Following the completion of training, MeshSplats transforms Gaussian elements into mesh faces, enabling rendering using ray tracing methods with all their associated benefits. Our model can be utilized immediately following transformation, yielding a mesh of slightly reduced quality without additional training. Furthermore, we can enhance the reconstruction quality through the application of a dedicated optimization algorithm that operates on mesh faces rather than Gaussian components. The efficacy of our method is substantiated by experimental results, underscoring its extensive applications in computer graphics and image processing."
2502.08085,"Traditional methods for visualizing dynamic human expressions, particularly in medical training, often rely on flat-screen displays or static mannequins, which have proven inefficient for realistic simulation. In response, we propose a platform that leverages a 3D interactive facial avatar capable of displaying non-verbal feedback, including pain signals. This avatar is projected onto a stereoscopic, view-dependent 3D display, offering a more immersive and realistic simulated patient experience for pain assessment practice. However, there is no existing solution that dynamically predicts and projects interactive 3D facial avatars in real-time. To overcome this, we emphasize the need for a 3D display projection system that can project the facial avatar holographically, allowing users to interact with the avatar from any viewpoint. By incorporating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and real-time view-dependent calibration, we significantly improve the training environment for accurate pain recognition and assessment."
2502.08107,"This study advances real-time volumetric cloud rendering in Computer Graphics (CG) by developing a specialized shader in Unreal Engine (UE), focusing on realistic cloud modeling and lighting. By leveraging ray-casting-based lighting algorithms, this work demonstrates the practical application of a dual-layered procedural noise model, eliminating the need for conventional two-dimensional (2D) weather textures. The shader allows for procedurally configured skies with a defined parameter set, offering flexibility for both artistic expression and realistic simulation. Empirical results reveal that the shader achieves an average rendering time of 35ms per frame while maintaining high visual accuracy and scene realism. Visual fidelity assessments indicate a 15% improvement in cloud realism over traditional 2D techniques, particularly in dynamic lighting scenarios. This research contributes to CG by bridging technical and aesthetic elements, enhancing real-time visual storytelling and immersion within gigital media environments."
2502.08297,"Volumetric video enables immersive experiences by capturing dynamic 3D scenes, enabling diverse applications for virtual reality, education, and telepresence. However, traditional methods struggle with fixed lighting conditions, while neural approaches face trade-offs in efficiency, quality, or adaptability for relightable scenarios. To address these limitations, we present BEAM, a novel pipeline that bridges 4D Gaussian representations with physically-based rendering (PBR) to produce high-quality, relightable volumetric videos from multi-view RGB footage. BEAM recovers detailed geometry and PBR properties via a series of available Gaussian-based techniques. It first combines Gaussian-based human performance tracking with geometry-aware rasterization in a coarse-to-fine optimization framework to recover spatially and temporally consistent geometries. We further enhance Gaussian attributes by incorporating PBR properties step by step. We generate roughness via a multi-view-conditioned diffusion model, and then derive AO and base color using a 2D-to-3D strategy, incorporating a tailored Gaussian-based ray tracer for efficient visibility computation. Once recovered, these dynamic, relightable assets integrate seamlessly into traditional CG pipelines, supporting real-time rendering with deferred shading and offline rendering with ray tracing. By offering realistic, lifelike visualizations under diverse lighting conditions, BEAM opens new possibilities for interactive entertainment, storytelling, and creative visualization."
2502.10046,"Creating lifelike virtual agents capable of interacting with their environments is a longstanding goal in computer graphics. This paper addresses the challenge of generating natural head rotations, a critical aspect of believable agent behavior for visual information gathering and dynamic responses to environmental cues. Although earlier methods have made significant strides, many rely on data-driven or saliency-based approaches, which often underperform in diverse settings and fail to capture deeper cognitive factors such as risk assessment, information seeking, and contextual prioritization. Consequently, generated behaviors can appear rigid or overlook critical scene elements, thereby diminishing the sense of realism. In this paper, we propose \textbf{ViRAC}, a \textbf{Vi}sion-\textbf{R}easoning \textbf{A}gent Head Movement \textbf{C}ontrol framework, which exploits the common-sense knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-scale models, including Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large-Language Models (LLMs). Rather than explicitly modeling every cognitive mechanism, ViRAC leverages the biases and patterns internalized by these models from extensive training, thus emulating human-like perceptual processes without hand-tuned heuristics. Experimental results in multiple scenarios reveal that ViRAC produces more natural and context-aware head rotations than recent state-of-the-art techniques. Quantitative evaluations show a closer alignment with real human head-movement data, while user studies confirm improved realism and cognitive plausibility."
2502.10872,"We present six thin plate/shell models, derived from three distinct types of curvature operators formulated within the corotational frame, for simulating both rest-flat and rest-curved triangular meshes. Each curvature operator derives a curvature expression corresponding to both a plate model and a shell model. The corotational edge-based hinge model uses an edge-based stencil to compute directional curvature, while the corotational FVM hinge model utilizes a triangle-centered stencil, applying the finite volume method (FVM) to superposition directional curvatures across edges, yielding a generalized curvature. The corotational smoothed hinge model also employs a triangle-centered stencil but transforms directional curvatures into a generalized curvature based on a quadratic surface fit. All models assume small strain and small curvature, leading to constant bending energy Hessians, which benefit implicit integrators. Through quantitative benchmarks and qualitative elastodynamic simulations with large time steps, we demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of these models. Our contributions enhance the thin plate/shell library for use in both computer graphics and engineering applications."
2502.12463,"Penetration depth calculation quantifies the extent of overlap between two objects and is crucial in fields like simulations, the metaverse, and robotics. Recognizing its significance, efforts have been made to accelerate this computation using parallel computing resources, such as CPUs and GPUs. Unlike traditional GPU cores, modern GPUs incorporate specialized ray-tracing cores (RT-cores) primarily used for rendering applications. We introduce a novel algorithm for penetration depth calculation that leverages RT-cores. Our approach includes a ray-tracing based algorithm for penetration surface extraction and another for calculating Hausdorff distance, optimizing the use of RT-cores. We tested our method across various generations of RTX GPUs with different benchmark scenes. The results demonstrated that our algorithm outperformed a state-of-the-art penetration depth calculation method and conventional GPU implementations by up to 37.66 and 5.33 times, respectively. These findings demonstrate the efficiency of our RT core-based method and suggest broad applicability for RT-cores in diverse computational tasks."
2502.13372,"While large vision-language models can generate motion graphics animations from text prompts, they regularly fail to include all spatio-temporal properties described in the prompt. We introduce MoVer, a motion verification DSL based on first-order logic that can check spatio-temporal properties of a motion graphics animation. We identify a general set of such properties that people commonly use to describe animations (e.g., the direction and timing of motions, the relative positioning of objects, etc.). We implement these properties as predicates in MoVer and provide an execution engine that can apply a MoVer program to any input SVG-based motion graphics animation. We then demonstrate how MoVer can be used in an LLM-based synthesis and verification pipeline for iteratively refining motion graphics animations. Given a text prompt, our pipeline synthesizes a motion graphics animation and a corresponding MoVer program. Executing the verification program on the animation yields a report of the predicates that failed and the report can be automatically fed back to LLM to iteratively correct the animation. To evaluate our pipeline, we build a synthetic dataset of 5600 text prompts paired with ground truth MoVer verification programs. We find that while our LLM-based pipeline is able to automatically generate a correct motion graphics animation for 58.8% of the test prompts without any iteration, this number raises to 93.6% with up to 50 correction iterations. Our code and dataset are atthis https URL."
2502.13491,"Persistent wrinkles are often observed on crumpled garments e.g., the wrinkles around the knees after sitting for a while. Such wrinkles can be easily recovered if not deformed for long, and otherwise be persistent. Since they are vital to the visual realism of cloth animation, we aim to simulate realistic looking persistent wrinkles. To this end, we present a physics-inspired fine-grained wrinkle model. Different from existing methods, we recognize the importance of the interplay between internal friction and plasticity during wrinkle formation. Furthermore, we model their time dependence for persistent wrinkles. Our model is capable of not only simulating realistic wrinkle patterns, but also their time-dependent changes according to how long the deformation is maintained. Through extensive experiments, we show that our model is effective in simulating realistic spatial and temporal varying wrinkles, versatile in simulating different materials, and capable of generating more fine-grained wrinkles than the state of the art."
2502.13945,"Texture and material blending is one of the leading methods for adding variety to rendered virtual worlds, creating composite materials, and generating procedural content. When done naively, it can introduce either visible seams or contrast loss, leading to an unnatural look not representative of blended textures. Earlier work proposed addressing this problem through careful manual parameter tuning, lengthy per-texture statistics precomputation, look-up tables, or training deep neural networks. In this work, we propose an alternative approach based on insights from image processing and Laplacian pyramid blending. Our approach does not require any precomputation or increased memory usage (other than the presence of a regular, non-Laplacian, texture mipmap chain), does not produce ghosting, preserves sharp local features, and can run in real time on the GPU at the cost of a few additional lower mipmap texture taps."
2502.13987,"Age transformation of facial images is a technique that edits age-related person's appearances while preserving the identity. Existing deep learning-based methods can reproduce natural age transformations; however, they only reproduce averaged transitions and fail to account for individual-specific appearances influenced by their life histories. In this paper, we propose the first diffusion model-based method for personalized age transformation. Our diffusion model takes a facial image and a target age as input and generates an age-edited face image as output. To reflect individual-specific features, we incorporate additional supervision using self-reference images, which are facial images of the same person at different ages. Specifically, we fine-tune a pretrained diffusion model for personalized adaptation using approximately 3 to 5 self-reference images. Additionally, we design an effective prompt to enhance the performance of age editing and identity preservation. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively compared to existing methods. The code and the pretrained model are available atthis https URL."
2502.13994,"We present a tool for enhancing the detail of physically based materials using an off-the-shelf diffusion model and inverse rendering. Our goal is to enhance the visual fidelity of materials with detail that is often tedious to author, by adding signs of wear, aging, weathering, etc. As these appearance details are often rooted in real-world processes, we leverage a generative image model trained on a large dataset of natural images with corresponding visuals in context. Starting with a given geometry, UV mapping, and basic appearance, we render multiple views of the object. We use these views, together with an appearance-defining text prompt, to condition a diffusion model. The details it generates are then backpropagated from the enhanced images to the material parameters via inverse differentiable rendering. For inverse rendering to be successful, the generated appearance has to be consistent across all the images. We propose two priors to address the multi-view consistency of the diffusion model. First, we ensure that the initial noise that seeds the diffusion process is itself consistent across views by integrating it from a view-independent UV space. Second, we enforce geometric consistency by biasing the attention mechanism via a projective constraint so that pixels attend strongly to their corresponding pixel locations in other views. Our approach does not require any training or finetuning of the diffusion model, is agnostic of the material model used, and the enhanced material properties, i.e., 2D PBR textures, can be further edited by artists. This project is available atthis https URL."
2502.13995,"Tuning-free approaches adapting large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models for identity-preserving text-to-video generation (IPT2V) have gained popularity recently due to their efficacy and scalability. However, significant challenges remain to achieve satisfied facial dynamics while keeping the identity unchanged. In this work, we present a novel tuning-free IPT2V framework by enhancing face knowledge of the pre-trained video model built on diffusion transformers (DiT), dubbed FantasyID. Essentially, 3D facial geometry prior is incorporated to ensure plausible facial structures during video synthesis. To prevent the model from learning copy-paste shortcuts that simply replicate reference face across frames, a multi-view face augmentation strategy is devised to capture diverse 2D facial appearance features, hence increasing the dynamics over the facial expressions and head poses. Additionally, after blending the 2D and 3D features as guidance, instead of naively employing cross-attention to inject guidance cues into DiT layers, a learnable layer-aware adaptive mechanism is employed to selectively inject the fused features into each individual DiT layers, facilitating balanced modeling of identity preservation and motion dynamics. Experimental results validate our model's superiority over the current tuning-free IPT2V methods."
2502.13997,"Style transfer enables the seamless integration of artistic styles from a style image into a content image, resulting in visually striking and aesthetically enriched outputs. Despite numerous advances in this field, existing methods did not explicitly focus on the signature style, which represents the distinct and recognizable visual traits of the image such as geometric and structural patterns, color palettes and brush strokes etc. In this paper, we introduce SigStyle, a framework that leverages the semantic priors that embedded in a personalized text-to-image diffusion model to capture the signature style representation. This style capture process is powered by a hypernetwork that efficiently fine-tunes the diffusion model for any given single style image. Style transfer then is conceptualized as the reconstruction process of content image through learned style tokens from the personalized diffusion model. Additionally, to ensure the content consistency throughout the style transfer process, we introduce a time-aware attention swapping technique that incorporates content information from the original image into the early denoising steps of target image generation. Beyond enabling high-quality signature style transfer across a wide range of styles, SigStyle supports multiple interesting applications, such as local style transfer, texture transfer, style fusion and style-guided text-to-image generation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate our approach outperforms existing style transfer methods for recognizing and transferring the signature styles."
2502.13999,"With the growing popularity of personalized human content creation and sharing, there is a rising demand for advanced techniques in customized human image generation. However, current methods struggle to simultaneously maintain the fidelity of human identity and ensure the consistency of textual prompts, often resulting in suboptimal outcomes. This shortcoming is primarily due to the lack of effective constraints during the simultaneous integration of visual and textual prompts, leading to unhealthy mutual interference that compromises the full expression of both types of input. Building on prior research that suggests visual and textual conditions influence different regions of an image in distinct ways, we introduce a novel Dual-Pathway Adapter (DP-Adapter) to enhance both high-fidelity identity preservation and textual consistency in personalized human image generation. Our approach begins by decoupling the target human image into visually sensitive and text-sensitive regions. For visually sensitive regions, DP-Adapter employs an Identity-Enhancing Adapter (IEA) to preserve detailed identity features. For text-sensitive regions, we introduce a Textual-Consistency Adapter (TCA) to minimize visual interference and ensure the consistency of textual semantics. To seamlessly integrate these pathways, we develop a Fine-Grained Feature-Level Blending (FFB) module that efficiently combines hierarchical semantic features from both pathways, resulting in more natural and coherent synthesis outcomes. Additionally, DP-Adapter supports various innovative applications, including controllable headshot-to-full-body portrait generation, age editing, old-photo to reality, and expression editing."
2502.14004,"Recent advancements in implicit 3D reconstruction methods, e.g., neural rendering fields and Gaussian splatting, have primarily focused on novel view synthesis of static or dynamic objects with continuous motion states. However, these approaches struggle to efficiently model a human-interactive object with n movable parts, requiring 2^n separate models to represent all discrete states. To overcome this limitation, we propose Inter3D, a new benchmark and approach for novel state synthesis of human-interactive objects. We introduce a self-collected dataset featuring commonly encountered interactive objects and a new evaluation pipeline, where only individual part states are observed during training, while part combination states remain unseen. We also propose a strong baseline approach that leverages Space Discrepancy Tensors to efficiently modelling all states of an object. To alleviate the impractical constraints on camera trajectories across training states, we propose a Mutual State Regularization mechanism to enhance the spatial density consistency of movable parts. In addition, we explore two occupancy grid sampling strategies to facilitate training efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark, showcasing the challenges of the task and the superiority of our approach."
2502.14006,"We present Im2SurfTex, a method that generates textures for input 3D shapes by learning to aggregate multi-view image outputs produced by 2D image diffusion models onto the shapes' texture space. Unlike existing texture generation techniques that use ad hoc backprojection and averaging schemes to blend multiview images into textures, often resulting in texture seams and artifacts, our approach employs a trained neural module to boost texture coherency. The key ingredient of our module is to leverage neural attention and appropriate positional encodings of image pixels based on their corresponding 3D point positions, normals, and surface-aware coordinates as encoded in geodesic distances within surface patches. These encodings capture texture correlations between neighboring surface points, ensuring better texture continuity. Experimental results show that our module improves texture quality, achieving superior performance in high-resolution texture generation."
2502.14007,"Structural guidance in an image-to-image translation allows intricate control over the shapes of synthesized images. Generating high-quality realistic images from user-specified rough hand-drawn sketches is one such task that aims to impose a structural constraint on the conditional generation process. While the premise is intriguing for numerous use cases of content creation and academic research, the problem becomes fundamentally challenging due to substantial ambiguities in freehand sketches. Furthermore, balancing the trade-off between shape consistency and realistic generation contributes to additional complexity in the process. Existing approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) generally utilize conditional GANs or GAN inversions, often requiring application-specific data and optimization objectives. The recent introduction of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) achieves a generational leap for low-level visual attributes in general image synthesis. However, directly retraining a large-scale diffusion model on a domain-specific subtask is often extremely difficult due to demanding computation costs and insufficient data. In this paper, we introduce a technique for sketch-to-image translation by exploiting the feature generalization capabilities of a large-scale diffusion model without retraining. In particular, we use a learnable lightweight mapping network to achieve latent feature translation from source to target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing techniques in qualitative and quantitative benchmarks, allowing high-resolution realistic image synthesis from rough hand-drawn sketches."
2502.14013,"DNN- or AI-based up-scaling algorithms are gaining in popularity due to the improvements in machine learning. Various up-scaling models using CNNs, GANs or mixed approaches have been published. The majority of models are evaluated using PSRN and SSIM or only a few example images. However, a performance evaluation with a wide range of real-world images and subjective evaluation is missing, which we tackle in the following paper. For this reason, we describe our developed dataset, which uses 136 base images and five different up-scaling methods, namely Real-ESRGAN, BSRGAN, waifu2x, KXNet, and Lanczos. Overall the dataset consists of 1496 annotated images. The labeling of our dataset focused on image appeal and has been performed using crowd-sourcing employing our open-source tool AVRate Voyager. We evaluate the appeal of the different methods, and the results indicate that Real-ESRGAN and BSRGAN are the best. Furthermore, we train a DNN to detect which up-scaling method has been used, the trained models have a good overall performance in our evaluation. In addition to this, we evaluate state-of-the-art image appeal and quality models, here none of the models showed a high prediction performance, therefore we also trained two own approaches. The first uses transfer learning and has the best performance, and the second model uses signal-based features and a random forest model with good overall performance. We share the data and implementation to allow further research in the context of open science."
2502.14178,"Talking head synthesis is to synthesize a lip-synchronized talking head video using audio. Recently, the capability of NeRF to enhance the realism and texture details of synthesized talking heads has attracted the attention of researchers. However, most current NeRF methods based on audio are exclusively concerned with the rendering of frontal faces. These methods are unable to generate clear talking heads in novel views. Another prevalent challenge in current 3D talking head synthesis is the difficulty in aligning acoustic and visual spaces, which often results in suboptimal lip-syncing of the generated talking heads. To address these issues, we propose Neural Radiance Field with 3D Prior Aided Audio Disentanglement for Talking Head Synthesis (NeRF-3DTalker). Specifically, the proposed method employs 3D prior information to synthesize clear talking heads with free views. Additionally, we propose a 3D Prior Aided Audio Disentanglement module, which is designed to disentangle the audio into two distinct categories: features related to 3D awarded speech movements and features related to speaking style. Moreover, to reposition the generated frames that are distant from the speaker's motion space in the real space, we have devised a local-global Standardized Space. This method normalizes the irregular positions in the generated frames from both global and local semantic perspectives. Through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, it has been demonstrated that our NeRF-3DTalker outperforms state-of-the-art in synthesizing realistic talking head videos, exhibiting superior image quality and lip synchronization.

However, existing approaches assume very specific conditions, such as uniform diffuse illumination, which are only available in certain high-end devices, hindering their scalability and cost. In contrast, in this work, we introduce a method inspired by intrinsic image decomposition, which accurately removes both shading and specularity, effectively allowing captures with any flatbed scanner. Further, we extend previous work on single-image material reflectance capture with the estimation of opacity and transmittance, critical components of full material appearance (SVBSDF), improving the results for any material captured with a flatbed scanner, at a very high resolution and accuracy"
2502.14684,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown significant advantages in novel view synthesis (NVS), particularly in achieving high rendering speeds and high-quality results. However, its geometric accuracy in 3D reconstruction remains limited due to the lack of explicit geometric constraints during optimization. This paper introduces CDGS, a confidence-aware depth regularization approach developed to enhance 3DGS. We leverage multi-cue confidence maps of monocular depth estimation and sparse Structure-from-Motion depth to adaptively adjust depth supervision during the optimization process. Our method demonstrates improved geometric detail preservation in early training stages and achieves competitive performance in both NVS quality and geometric accuracy. Experiments on the publicly available Tanks and Temples benchmark dataset show that our method achieves more stable convergence behavior and more accurate geometric reconstruction results, with improvements of up to 2.31 dB in PSNR for NVS and consistently lower geometric errors in M3C2 distance metrics. Notably, our method reaches comparable F-scores to the original 3DGS with only 50% of the training iterations. We expect this work will facilitate the development of efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction systems for real-world applications such as digital twin creation, heritage preservation, or forestry applications."
2502.14844,"Personalizing generative text-to-image models has seen remarkable progress, but extending this personalization to text-to-video models presents unique challenges. Unlike static concepts, personalizing text-to-video models has the potential to capture dynamic concepts, i.e., entities defined not only by their appearance but also by their motion. In this paper, we introduce Set-and-Sequence, a novel framework for personalizing Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)-based generative video models with dynamic concepts. Our approach imposes a spatio-temporal weight space within an architecture that does not explicitly separate spatial and temporal features. This is achieved in two key stages. First, we fine-tune Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers using an unordered set of frames from the video to learn an identity LoRA basis that represents the appearance, free from temporal interference. In the second stage, with the identity LoRAs frozen, we augment their coefficients with Motion Residuals and fine-tune them on the full video sequence, capturing motion dynamics. Our Set-and-Sequence framework results in a spatio-temporal weight space that effectively embeds dynamic concepts into the video model's output domain, enabling unprecedented editability and compositionality while setting a new benchmark for personalizing dynamic concepts."

2502.16731,"Domain scientists often face I/O and storage challenges when keeping raw data from large-scale simulations. Saving visualization images, albeit practical, is limited to preselected viewpoints, transfer functions, and simulation parameters. Recent advances in scientific visualization leverage deep learning techniques for visualization synthesis by offering effective ways to infer unseen visualizations when only image samples are given during training. However, due to the lack of 3D geometry awareness, existing methods typically require many training images and significant learning time to generate novel visualizations faithfully. To address these limitations, we propose ViSNeRF, a novel 3D-aware approach for visualization synthesis using neural radiance fields. Leveraging a multidimensional radiance field representation, ViSNeRF efficiently reconstructs visualizations of dynamic volumetric scenes from a sparse set of labeled image samples with flexible parameter exploration over transfer functions, isovalues, timesteps, or simulation parameters. Through qualitative and quantitative comparative evaluation, we demonstrate ViSNeRF's superior performance over several representative baseline methods, positioning it as the state-of-the-art solution.

However, prior work has primarily focused on evaluating its performance through software-based rendering on programmable shader cores, leaving its performance when exploiting fixed-function graphics units largely unexplored.In this paper, we investigate the performance implications of performing radiance field rendering on the hardware graphics pipeline. In doing so, we implement the state-of-the-art radiance field method, 3D Gaussian splatting, using graphics APIs and evaluate it across synthetic and real-world scenes on today's graphics hardware. Based on our analysis, we present VR-Pipe, which seamlessly integrates two innovations into graphics hardware to streamline the hardware pipeline for volume rendering, such as radiance field methods. First, we introduce native hardware support for early termination by repurposing existing special-purpose hardware in modern GPUs. Second, we propose multi-granular tile binning with quad merging, which opportunistically blends fragments in shader cores before passing them to fixed-function blending units. Our evaluation shows that VR-Pipe greatly improves rendering performance, achieving up to a 2.78x speedup over the conventional graphics pipeline with negligible hardware overhead."

By integrating both stochastic and gradient-based optimization techniques, our approach effectively navigates the complex energy landscapes typical of fractal inversion, ensuring robust performance and the ability to escape local minima. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness through comparisons with various fractal inversion techniques, highlighting its ability to recover high-quality fractal codes and perform extensive zoom-ins to reveal intricate patterns from just a single image."

Our work features a transformer-based denoising network, tailored for arbitrary skeleton learning, integrating topology information into the traditional attention mechanism. Additionally, by incorporating textual joint descriptions into the latent feature representation, AnyTop learns semantic correspondences between joints across diverse skeletons. Our evaluation demonstrates that AnyTop generalizes well, even with as few as three training examples per topology, and can produce motions for unseen skeletons as well.

2502.17531,"With the rising popularity of 3D Gaussian splatting and the expanse of applications from rendering to 3D reconstruction, there comes also a need for geometry processing applications directly on this new representation. While considering the centers of Gaussians as a point cloud or meshing them is an option that allows to apply existing algorithms, this might ignore information present in the data or be unnecessarily expensive. Additionally, Gaussian splatting tends to contain a large number of outliers which do not affect the rendering quality but need to be handled correctly in order not to produce noisy results in geometry processing applications. In this work, we propose a formulation to compute the Laplace-Beltrami operator, a widely used tool in geometry processing, directly on Gaussian splatting using the Mahalanobis distance. While conceptually similar to a point cloud Laplacian, our experiments show superior accuracy on the point clouds encoded in the Gaussian splatting centers and, additionally, the operator can be used to evaluate the quality of the output during optimization."
2502.17712,"Texture-space shading (TSS) methods decouple shading and rasterization, allowing shading to be performed at a different framerate and spatial resolution than rasterization. TSS has many potential applications, including streaming shading across networks, and reducing rendering cost via shading reuse across consecutive frames and/or shading at reduced resolutions relative to display resolution. Real-time TSS shading requires texture atlases small enough to be easily stored in GPU memory. Using static atlases leads to significant space wastage, motivating real-time per-frame atlassing strategies that pack only the content visible in each frame. We propose FastAtlas, a novel atlasing method that runs entirely on the GPU and is fast enough to be performed at interactive rates per-frame. Our method combines new per-frame chart computation and parametrization strategies and an efficient general chart packing algorithm. Our chartification strategy removes visible seams in output renders, and our parameterization ensures a constant texel-to-pixel ratio, avoiding undesirable undersampling artifacts. Our packing method is more general, and produces more tightly packed atlases, than previous work. Jointly, these innovations enable us to produce shading outputs of significantly higher visual quality than those produced using alternative atlasing strategies. We validate FastAtlas by shading and rendering challenging scenes using different atlasing settings, reflecting the needs of different TSS applications (temporal reuse, streaming, reduced or elevated shading rates). We extensively compare FastAtlas to prior alternatives and demonstrate that it achieves better shading quality and reduces texture stretch compared to prior approaches using the same settings."
2502.17866,"Drawing is a fun and intuitive way to create a character, accessible even to small children. However, animating 2D figure drawings is a much more challenging task, requiring specialized tools and skills. Bringing 2D figures to 3D so they can be animated and consumed in immersive media poses an even greater challenge. Moreover, it is desirable to preserve the unique style and identity of the figure when it is being animated and viewed from different perspectives. In this work, we present an approachable and easy-to-create 2.5D character model and retargeting technique that can apply complex 3D skeletal motion, including rotation within the transverse plane, onto a single childlike figure drawing in a style-preserving manner in realtime. Because our solution is view-dependent, the resulting character is well-suited for animation in both 2D and 3D contexts. We also present a novel annotation study motivating our system design decisions and a pair of user studies validating the usefulness and appeal of our solution. We showcase the generality of our system in a range of 2D and 3D applications."
2502.18309,"Music-driven dance generation is a challenging task as it requires strict adherence to genre-specific choreography while ensuring physically realistic and precisely synchronized dance sequences with the music's beats and rhythm. Although significant progress has been made in music-conditioned dance generation, most existing methods struggle to convey specific stylistic attributes in generated dance. To bridge this gap, we propose a diffusion-based framework for genre-specific 3D full-body dance generation, conditioned on both music and descriptive text. To effectively incorporate genre information, we develop a text-based control mechanism that maps input prompts, either explicit genre labels or free-form descriptive text, into genre-specific control signals, enabling precise and controllable text-guided generation of genre-consistent dance motions. Furthermore, to enhance the alignment between music and textual conditions, we leverage the features of a music foundation model, facilitating coherent and semantically aligned dance synthesis. Last, to balance the objectives of extracting text-genre information and maintaining high-quality generation results, we propose a novel multi-task optimization strategy. This effectively balances competing factors such as physical realism, spatial accuracy, and text classification, significantly improving the overall quality of the generated sequences. Extensive experimental results obtained on the FineDance and AIST++ datasets demonstrate the superiority of GCDance over the existing state-of-the-art approaches."
2502.19056,"Fatigue modeling is essential for motion synthesis tasks to model human motions under fatigued conditions and biomechanical engineering applications, such as investigating the variations in movement patterns and posture due to fatigue, defining injury risk mitigation and prevention strategies, formulating fatigue minimization schemes and creating improved ergonomic designs. Nevertheless, employing data-driven methods for synthesizing the impact of fatigue on motion, receives little to no attention in the literature. In this work, we present Fatigue-PINN, a deep learning framework based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks, for modeling fatigued human movements, while providing joint-specific fatigue configurations for adaptation and mitigation of motion artifacts on a joint level, resulting in more realistic animations. To account for muscle fatigue, we simulate the fatigue-induced fluctuations in the maximum exerted joint torques by leveraging a PINN adaptation of the Three-Compartment Controller model to exploit physics-domain knowledge for improving accuracy. This model also introduces parametric motion alignment with respect to joint-specific fatigue, hence avoiding sharp frame transitions. Our results indicate that Fatigue-PINN accurately simulates the effects of externally perceived fatigue on open-type human movements being consistent with findings from real-world experimental fatigue studies. Since fatigue is incorporated in torque space, Fatigue-PINN provides an end-to-end encoder-decoder-like architecture, to ensure transforming joint angles to joint torques and vice-versa, thus, being compatible with motion synthesis frameworks operating on joint angles."
2502.19318,"Since its introduction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become an important reference method for learning 3D representations of a captured scene, allowing real-time novel-view synthesis with high visual quality and fast training times. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which preceded 3DGS, are based on a principled ray-marching approach for volumetric rendering. In contrast, while sharing a similar image formation model with NeRF, 3DGS uses a hybrid rendering solution that builds on the strengths of volume rendering and primitive rasterization. A crucial benefit of 3DGS is its performance, achieved through a set of approximations, in many cases with respect to volumetric rendering theory. A naturally arising question is whether replacing these approximations with more principled volumetric rendering solutions can improve the quality of 3DGS. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of the various approximations and assumptions used by the original 3DGS solution. We demonstrate that, while more accurate volumetric rendering can help for low numbers of primitives, the power of efficient optimization and the large number of Gaussians allows 3DGS to outperform volumetric rendering despite its approximations."
2502.19441,"Recent advancements in Gaussian-based human body reconstruction have achieved notable success in creating animatable avatars. However, there are ongoing challenges to fully exploit the SMPL model's prior knowledge and enhance the visual fidelity of these models to achieve more refined avatar reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce AniGaussian which addresses the above issues with two insights. First, we propose an innovative pose guided deformation strategy that effectively constrains the dynamic Gaussian avatar with SMPL pose guidance, ensuring that the reconstructed model not only captures the detailed surface nuances but also maintains anatomical correctness across a wide range of motions. Second, we tackle the expressiveness limitations of Gaussian models in representing dynamic human bodies. We incorporate rigid-based priors from previous works to enhance the dynamic transform capabilities of the Gaussian model. Furthermore, we introduce a split-with-scale strategy that significantly improves geometry quality. The ablative study experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of our innovative model design. Through extensive comparisons with existing methods, AniGaussian demonstrates superior performance in both qualitative result and quantitative metrics."
2502.19453,"Vector format has been popular for representing icons and sketches. It has also been famous for design purposes. Regarding image editing, research on vector graphics editing rarely exists in contrast with the raster counterpart. We considered the reason to be the lack of datasets and benchmarks. Thus, we propose SVGEditBench V2, a benchmark dataset for instruction-based SVG editing. SVGEditBench V2 comprises triplets of an original image, a ground truth image, and the editing prompt. We built the dataset by first extracting image pairs from various SVG emoji datasets. Then, we had GPT-4o to create the prompt. We found that triplets gained by this simple pipeline contain varying sorts of editing tasks. Additionally, we performed the editing tasks with existing LLMs and investigated how those current methods can perform SVG editing. Although there were some successful cases, we found that there is a massive room for improvement."
2502.19454,"Recent developments in Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability to generate high-quality video content. Nonetheless, the potential of VDMs for creating transparent videos remains largely uncharted. In this paper, we introduce TransVDM, the first diffusion-based model specifically designed for transparent video generation. TransVDM integrates a Transparent Variational Autoencoder (TVAE) and a pretrained UNet-based VDM, along with a novel Alpha Motion Constraint Module (AMCM). The TVAE captures the alpha channel transparency of video frames and encodes it into the latent space of the VDMs, facilitating a seamless transition to transparent video diffusion models. To improve the detection of transparent areas, the AMCM integrates motion constraints from the foreground within the VDM, helping to reduce undesirable artifacts. Moreover, we curate a dataset containing 250K transparent frames for training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various benchmarks."
2502.19455,"Diffusion-based video generation techniques have significantly improved zero-shot talking-head avatar generation, enhancing the naturalness of both head motion and facial expressions. However, existing methods suffer from poor controllability, making them less applicable to real-world scenarios such as filmmaking and live streaming for e-commerce. To address this limitation, we propose FLAP, a novel approach that integrates explicit 3D intermediate parameters (head poses and facial expressions) into the diffusion model for end-to-end generation of realistic portrait videos. The proposed architecture allows the model to generate vivid portrait videos from audio while simultaneously incorporating additional control signals, such as head rotation angles and eye-blinking frequency. Furthermore, the decoupling of head pose and facial expression allows for independent control of each, offering precise manipulation of both the avatar's pose and facial expressions. We also demonstrate its flexibility in integrating with existing 3D head generation methods, bridging the gap between 3D model-based approaches and end-to-end diffusion techniques. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms recent audio-driven portrait video models in both naturalness and controllability."
2502.19457,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a pioneering approach in explicit scene rendering and computer graphics. Unlike traditional neural radiance field (NeRF) methods, which typically rely on implicit, coordinate-based models to map spatial coordinates to pixel values, 3DGS utilizes millions of learnable 3D Gaussians. Its differentiable rendering technique and inherent capability for explicit scene representation and manipulation positions 3DGS as a potential game-changer for the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation technologies. This enables 3DGS to deliver real-time rendering speeds while offering unparalleled editability levels. However, despite its advantages, 3DGS suffers from substantial memory and storage requirements, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview focusing on the scalability and compression of 3DGS. We begin with a detailed background overview of 3DGS, followed by a structured taxonomy of existing compression methods. Additionally, we analyze and compare current methods from the topological perspective, evaluating their strengths and limitations in terms of fidelity, compression ratios, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we explore how advancements in efficient NeRF representations can inspire future developments in 3DGS optimization. Finally, we conclude with current research challenges and highlight key directions for future exploration."
2502.20045,"Professional 3D asset creation often requires diverse sculpting brushes to add surface details and geometric structures. Despite recent progress in 3D generation, producing reusable sculpting brushes compatible with artists' workflows remains an open and challenging problem. These sculpting brushes are typically represented as vector displacement maps (VDMs), which existing models cannot easily generate compared to natural images. This paper presents Text2VDM, a novel framework for text-to-VDM brush generation through the deformation of a dense planar mesh guided by score distillation sampling (SDS). The original SDS loss is designed for generating full objects and struggles with generating desirable sub-object structures from scratch in brush generation. We refer to this issue as semantic coupling, which we address by introducing weighted blending of prompt tokens to SDS, resulting in a more accurate target distribution and semantic guidance. Experiments demonstrate that Text2VDM can generate diverse, high-quality VDM brushes for sculpting surface details and geometric structures. Our generated brushes can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream modeling software, enabling various applications such as mesh stylization and real-time interactive modeling."
2502.20376,"Text-to-image diffusion models offer powerful image editing capabilities. To edit real images, many methods rely on the inversion of the image into Gaussian noise. A common approach to invert an image is to gradually add noise to the image, where the noise is determined by reversing the sampling equation. This process has an inherent tradeoff between reconstruction and editability, limiting the editing of challenging images such as highly-detailed ones. Recognizing the reliance of text-to-image models inversion on a text condition, this work explores the importance of the condition choice. We show that a condition that precisely aligns with the input image significantly improves the inversion quality. Based on our findings, we introduce Tight Inversion, an inversion method that utilizes the most possible precise condition -- the input image itself. This tight condition narrows the distribution of the model's output and enhances both reconstruction and editability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when combined with existing inversion methods through extensive experiments, evaluating the reconstruction accuracy as well as the integration with various editing methods."
2502.21207,"Preserving semantics, in particular in terms of contacts, is a key challenge when retargeting motion between characters of different morphologies. Our solution relies on a low-dimensional embedding of the character's mesh, based on rigged key vertices that are automatically transferred from the source to the target. Motion descriptors are extracted from the trajectories of these key vertices, providing an embedding that contains combined semantic information about both shape and pose. A novel, adaptive algorithm is then used to automatically select and weight the most relevant features over time, enabling us to efficiently optimize the target motion until it conforms to these constraints, so as to preserve the semantics of the source motion. Our solution allows extensions to several novel use-cases where morphology and mesh contacts were previously overlooked, such as multi-character retargeting and motion transfer on uneven terrains. As our results show, our method is able to achieve real-time retargeting onto a wide variety of characters. Extensive experiments and comparison with state-of-the-art methods using several relevant metrics demonstrate improved results, both in terms of motion smoothness and contact accuracy."
2503.00605,"We introduce the first method for generating Vector Displacement Maps (VDMs): parameterized, detailed geometric stamps commonly used in 3D modeling. Given a single input image, our method first generates multi-view normal maps and then reconstructs a VDM from the normals via a novel reconstruction pipeline. We also propose an efficient algorithm for extracting VDMs from 3D objects, and present the first academic VDM dataset. Compared to existing 3D generative models focusing on complete shapes, we focus on generating parts that can be seamlessly attached to shape surfaces. The method gives artists rich control over adding geometric details to a 3D shape. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines. Generating VDMs offers additional benefits, such as using 2D image editing to customize and refine 3D details."
2503.00726,"3D scene reconstruction is essential for applications in virtual reality, robotics, and autonomous driving, enabling machines to understand and interact with complex environments. Traditional 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques rely on images captured from multiple viewpoints to achieve optimal performance, but this dependence limits their use in scenarios where only a single image is available. In this work, we introduce FlashDreamer, a novel approach for reconstructing a complete 3D scene from a single image, significantly reducing the need for multi-view inputs. Our approach leverages a pre-trained vision-language model to generate descriptive prompts for the scene, guiding a diffusion model to produce images from various perspectives, which are then fused to form a cohesive 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method effectively and robustly expands single-image inputs into a comprehensive 3D scene, extending monocular 3D reconstruction capabilities without further training. Our code is availablethis https URL."
2503.00807,"We present GenAnalysis, an implicit shape generation framework that allows joint analysis of man-made shapes, including shape matching and joint shape segmentation. The key idea is to enforce an as-affine-as-possible (AAAP) deformation between synthetic shapes of the implicit generator that are close to each other in the latent space, which we achieve by designing a regularization loss. It allows us to understand the shape variation of each shape in the context of neighboring shapes and also offers structure-preserving interpolations between the input shapes. We show how to extract these shape variations by recovering piecewise affine vector fields in the tangent space of each shape. These vector fields provide single-shape segmentation cues. We then derive shape correspondences by iteratively propagating AAAP deformations across a sequence of intermediate shapes. These correspondences are then used to aggregate single-shape segmentation cues into consistent segmentations. We conduct experiments on the ShapeNet dataset to show superior performance in shape matching and joint shape segmentation over previous methods."
2503.00816,"This study addresses the challenge of self-supervised learning for 3D mesh analysis. It presents an new approach that uses random walks as a form of data augmentation to generate diverse representations of mesh surfaces. Furthermore, it employs a combination of contrastive and clustering losses. The contrastive learning framework maximizes similarity between augmented instances of the same mesh while minimizing similarity between different meshes. We integrate this with a clustering loss, enhancing class distinction across training epochs and mitigating training variance. Our model's effectiveness is evaluated using mean Average Precision (mAP) scores and a supervised SVM linear classifier on extracted features, demonstrating its potential for various downstream tasks such as object classification and shape retrieval."
2503.00868,"While the generation of 3D content from single-view images has been extensively studied, the creation of physically consistent 3D dynamic scenes from videos remains in its early stages. We propose a novel framework leveraging generative 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models to extract and re-simulate 3D dynamic fluid objects from single-view videos using simulation methods. The fluid geometry represented by 3DGS is initially generated and optimized from single-view images, then denoised, densified, and aligned across frames. We estimate the fluid surface velocity using optical flow, propose a mainstream extraction algorithm to refine it. The 3D volumetric velocity field is then derived from the velocity of the fluid's enclosed surface. The velocity field is therewith converted into a divergence-free, grid-based representation, enabling the optimization of simulation parameters through its differentiability across frames. This process outputs simulation-ready fluid assets with physical dynamics closely matching those observed in the source video. Our approach is applicable to various liquid fluids, including inviscid and viscous types, and allows users to edit the output geometry or extend movement durations seamlessly. This automatic method for creating 3D dynamic fluid assets from single-view videos, easily obtainable from the internet, shows great potential for generating large-scale 3D fluid assets at a low cost."
2503.00887,"Translating the rich visual fidelity of volumetric rendering techniques into physically realizable 3D prints remains an open challenge. We introduce DreamPrinting, a novel pipeline that transforms radiance-based volumetric representations into explicit, material-centric Volumetric Printing Primitives (VPPs). While volumetric rendering primitives (e.g., NeRF) excel at capturing intricate geometry and appearance, they lack the physical constraints necessary for real-world fabrication, such as pigment compatibility and material density. DreamPrinting addresses these challenges by integrating the Kubelka-Munk model with a spectrophotometric calibration process to characterize and mix pigments for accurate reproduction of color and translucency. The result is a continuous-to-discrete mapping that determines optimal pigment concentrations for each voxel, ensuring fidelity to both geometry and optical properties. A 3D stochastic halftoning procedure then converts these concentrations into printable labels, enabling fine-grained control over opacity, texture, and color gradients. Our evaluations show that DreamPrinting achieves exceptional detail in reproducing semi-transparent structures-such as fur, leaves, and clouds-while outperforming traditional surface-based methods in managing translucency and internal consistency. Furthermore, by seamlessly integrating VPPs with cutting-edge 3D generation techniques, DreamPrinting expands the potential for complex, high-quality volumetric prints, providing a robust framework for printing objects that closely mirror their digital origins."
2503.00928,"The integration of deep generative networks into generating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models has garnered increasing attention over recent years. Traditional methods often rely on discrete sequences of parametric line/curve segments to represent sketches. Differently, we introduce RECAD, a novel framework that generates Raster sketches and 3D Extrusions for CAD models. Representing sketches as raster images offers several advantages over discrete sequences: 1) it breaks the limitations on the types and numbers of lines/curves, providing enhanced geometric representation capabilities; 2) it enables interpolation within a continuous latent space; and 3) it allows for more intuitive user control over the output. Technically, RECAD employs two diffusion networks: the first network generates extrusion boxes conditioned on the number and types of extrusions, while the second network produces sketch images conditioned on these extrusion boxes. By combining these two networks, RECAD effectively generates sketch-and-extrude CAD models, offering a more robust and intuitive approach to CAD model generation. Experimental results indicate that RECAD achieves strong performance in unconditional generation, while also demonstrating effectiveness in conditional generation and output editing."
2503.01016,"Keyframes are a standard representation for kinematic motion specification. Recent learned motion-inbetweening methods use keyframes as a way to control generative motion models, and are trained to generate life-like motion that matches the exact poses and timings of input keyframes. However, the quality of generated motion may degrade if the timing of these constraints is not perfectly consistent with the desired motion. Unfortunately, correctly specifying keyframe timings is a tedious and challenging task in practice. Our goal is to create a system that synthesizes high-quality motion from keyframes, even if keyframes are imprecisely timed. We present a method that allows constraints to be retimed as part of the generation process. Specifically, we introduce a novel model architecture that explicitly outputs a time-warping function to correct mistimed keyframes, and spatial residuals that add pose details. We demonstrate how our method can automatically turn approximately timed keyframe constraints into diverse, realistic motions with plausible timing and detailed submovements."
2503.0137,"Diffusion models have achieved great success in generating 2D images. However, the quality and generalizability of 3D content generation remain limited. State-of-the-art methods often require large-scale 3D assets for training, which are challenging to collect. In this work, we introduce Kiss3DGen (Keep It Simple and Straightforward in 3D Generation), an efficient framework for generating, editing, and enhancing 3D objects by repurposing a well-trained 2D image diffusion model for 3D generation. Specifically, we fine-tune a diffusion model to generate ''3D Bundle Image'', a tiled representation composed of multi-view images and their corresponding normal maps. The normal maps are then used to reconstruct a 3D mesh, and the multi-view images provide texture mapping, resulting in a complete 3D model. This simple method effectively transforms the 3D generation problem into a 2D image generation task, maximizing the utilization of knowledge in pretrained diffusion models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our Kiss3DGen model is compatible with various diffusion model techniques, enabling advanced features such as 3D editing, mesh and texture enhancement, etc. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its ability to produce high-quality 3D models efficiently."
2503.01425,"We introduce MeshPad, a generative approach that creates 3D meshes from sketch inputs. Building on recent advances in artist-reminiscent triangle mesh generation, our approach addresses the need for interactive mesh creation. To this end, we focus on enabling consistent edits by decomposing editing into 'deletion' of regions of a mesh, followed by 'addition' of new mesh geometry. Both operations are invoked by simple user edits of a sketch image, facilitating an iterative content creation process and enabling the construction of complex 3D meshes. Our approach is based on a triangle sequence-based mesh representation, exploiting a large Transformer model for mesh triangle addition and deletion. In order to perform edits interactively, we introduce a vertex-aligned speculative prediction strategy on top of our additive mesh generator. This speculator predicts multiple output tokens corresponding to a vertex, thus significantly reducing the computational cost of inference and accelerating the editing process, making it possible to execute each editing step in only a few seconds. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MeshPad outperforms state-of-the-art sketch-conditioned mesh generation methods, achieving more than 22% mesh quality improvement in Chamfer distance, and being preferred by 90% of participants in perceptual evaluations."
2503.02218,"Purpose: This study proposes a novel anatomically-driven dynamic modeling framework for coronary arteries using skeletal skinning weights computation, aiming to achieve precise control over vessel deformation while maintaining real-time performance for surgical simulation applications. Methods: We developed a computational framework based on biharmonic energy minimization for skinning weight calculation, incorporating volumetric discretization through tetrahedral mesh generation. The method implements temporal sampling and interpolation for continuous vessel deformation throughout the cardiac cycle, with mechanical constraints and volume conservation enforcement. The framework was validated using clinical datasets from 5 patients, comparing interpolated deformation results against ground truth data obtained from frame-by-frame segmentation across cardiac phases. Results: The proposed framework effectively handled interactive vessel manipulation. Geometric accuracy evaluation showed mean Hausdorff distance of 4.96 +- 1.78 mm and mean surface distance of 1.78 +- 0.75 mm between interpolated meshes and ground truth models. The Branch Completeness Ratio achieved 1.82 +- 0.46, while Branch Continuity Score maintained 0.84 +- 0.06 (scale 0-1) across all datasets. The system demonstrated capability in supporting real-time guidewire-vessel collision detection and contrast medium flow simulation throughout the complete coronary tree structure. Conclusion: Our skinning weight-based methodology enhances model interactivity and applicability while maintaining geometric accuracy.

2503.02745,"We introduce ArcPro, a novel learning framework built on architectural programs to recover structured 3D abstractions from highly sparse and low-quality point clouds. Specifically, we design a domain-specific language (DSL) to hierarchically represent building structures as a program, which can be efficiently converted into a mesh. We bridge feedforward and inverse procedural modeling by using a feedforward process for training data synthesis, allowing the network to make reverse predictions. We train an encoder-decoder on the points-program pairs to establish a mapping from unstructured point clouds to architectural programs, where a 3D convolutional encoder extracts point cloud features and a transformer decoder autoregressively predicts the programs in a tokenized form. Inference by our method is highly efficient and produces plausible and faithful 3D abstractions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArcPro outperforms both traditional architectural proxy reconstruction and learning-based abstraction methods. We further explore its potential to work with multi-view image and natural language inputs."
2503.03068,"In the early stages of architectural design, shoebox models are typically used as a simplified representation of building structures but require extensive operations to transform them into detailed designs. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) provides a promising solution to automate this transformation, but ensuring multi-view consistency remains a significant challenge. To solve this issue, we propose a novel three-stage consistent image generation framework using generative AI models to generate architectural designs from shoebox model representations. The proposed method enhances state-of-the-art image generation diffusion models to generate multi-view consistent architectural images. We employ ControlNet as the backbone and optimize it to accommodate multi-view inputs of architectural shoebox models captured from predefined perspectives. To ensure stylistic and structural consistency across multi-view images, we propose an image space loss module that incorporates style loss, structural loss and angle alignment loss. We then use depth estimation method to extract depth maps from the generated multi-view images. Finally, we use the paired data of the architectural images and depth maps as inputs to improve the multi-view consistency via the depth-aware 3D attention module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can generate multi-view architectural images with consistent style and structural coherence from shoebox model inputs."
2503.0309,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has advanced rapidly, enabling the generation of renderings from architectural sketches. This progress has significantly improved the efficiency of communication and conceptual expression during the early stage of architectural design. However, generated images often lack the structural details from architects' sketches. While sketches typically emphasize the overall structure, crucial components such as windows and doors are often represented by simple lines or omitted entirely. For school buildings, it is essential to control architectural components, such as the shape and proportion of windows, as these factors directly influence the accuracy of the generated images in reflecting the architect's design intentions. To address this issue, we propose a structure-aware diffusion model for architectural image generation to refine expressing design intentions through retrieval augmentation. Our framework utilizes architectural components to enhance the generation process, addressing the details that may be lacking in the sketches. These components provide clear spatial and structural details, improving the model's ability to interpret and generate architectural details. The refined sketches, combined with text prompts, are fed into the proposed structure-aware diffusion model to generate detailed and realistic school building images. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating architectural designs."
2503.03326,"The oceans cover the vast majority of the Earth. Therefore, their simulation has many scientific, industrial and military interests, including computer graphics domain. By fully exploiting the multi-threading power of GPU and CPU, current state-of-the-art tools can achieve real-time ocean simulation, even if it is sometimes needed to reduce the physical realism for large scenes. Although most of the building blocks for implementing an ocean simulator are described in the literature, a clear explanation of how they interconnect is lacking. Hence, this paper proposes to bring all these components together, detailing all their interactions, in a comprehensive and fully described real-time framework that simulates the free ocean surface and the coupling between solids and fluid.

The two main ones are: calculating the real-time velocity of ocean fluids at any depth; computing the input of the solid to fluid coupling algorithm."
2503.04037,"The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has significantly advanced 3D reconstruction by providing high fidelity and fast training speeds across various scenarios. While recent efforts have mainly focused on improving model structures to compress data volume or reduce artifacts during zoom-in and zoom-out operations, they often overlook an underlying issue: training sampling deficiency. In zoomed-in views, Gaussian primitives can appear unregulated and distorted due to their dilation limitations and the insufficient availability of scale-specific training samples. Consequently, incorporating pseudo-details that ensure the completeness and alignment of the scene becomes essential. In this paper, we introduce a new training method that integrates diffusion models and multi-scale training using pseudo-ground-truth data. This approach not only notably mitigates the dilation and zoomed-in artifacts but also enriches reconstructed scenes with precise details out of existing scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks and extends the capabilities of 3D reconstruction beyond training datasets."
2503.04496,"Data driven and autoregressive indoor scene synthesis systems generate indoor scenes automatically by suggesting and then placing objects one at a time. Empirical observations show that current systems tend to produce incomplete next object location distributions. We introduce a system which addresses this problem. We design a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that specifies functional constraints. Programs from our language take as input a partial scene and object to place. Upon execution they predict possible object placements. We design a generative model which writes these programs automatically. Available 3D scene datasets do not contain programs to train on, so we build upon previous work in unsupervised program induction to introduce a new program bootstrapping algorithm. In order to quantify our empirical observations we introduce a new evaluation procedure which captures how well a system models per-object location distributions. We ask human annotators to label all the possible places an object can go in a scene and show that our system produces per-object location distributions more consistent with human annotators. Our system also generates indoor scenes of comparable quality to previous systems and while previous systems degrade in performance when training data is sparse, our system does not degrade to the same degree."

Generative machine learning models present a way around these issues, but they have previously been limited by the fixed size of their generation area. We present a new microstructure generation methodology leveraging advances in inpainting using denoising diffusion models to overcome this generation area limitation. We show that microstructures generated with the presented methodology are statistically similar to grain structures generated with a kinetic Monte Carlo simulator, SPPARKS."
2503.04824,"Diffusion models have achieved significant progress in both image and video generation while still suffering from huge computation costs. As an effective solution, flow matching aims to reflow the diffusion process of diffusion models into a straight line for a few-step and even one-step generation. However, in this paper, we suggest that the original training pipeline of flow matching is not optimal and introduce two techniques to improve it. Firstly, we introduce progressive reflow, which progressively reflows the diffusion models in local timesteps until the whole diffusion progresses, reducing the difficulty of flow matching. Second, we introduce aligned v-prediction, which highlights the importance of direction matching in flow matching over magnitude matching. Experimental results on SDv1.5 and SDXL demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, for example, conducting on SDv1.5 achieves an FID of 10.70 on MSCOCO2014 validation set with only 4 sampling steps, close to our teacher model (32 DDIM steps, FID = 10.05)."
2503.05168,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a crucial rendering technique for many real-time applications. However, the limited hardware resources on today's mobile platforms hinder these applications, as they struggle to achieve real-time performance. In this paper, we propose SeeLe, a general framework designed to accelerate the 3DGS pipeline for resource-constrained mobile devices.Specifically, we propose two GPU-oriented techniques: hybrid preprocessing and contribution-aware rasterization. Hybrid preprocessing alleviates the GPU compute and memory pressure by reducing the number of irrelevant Gaussians during rendering. The key is to combine our view-dependent scene representation with online filtering. Meanwhile, contribution-aware rasterization improves the GPU utilization at the rasterization stage by prioritizing Gaussians with high contributions while reducing computations for those with low contributions. Both techniques can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS pipelines with minimal fine-tuning. Collectively, our framework achieves 2.6$\times$ speedup and 32.3\% model reduction while achieving superior rendering quality compared to existing methods."

The dynamic head Gaussian model is trained based on the FLAME parameterized model. Each Gaussian splat is embedded within the FLAME mesh to achieve mesh-based animation of the Gaussian model. Before training, our selection strategy calculates the 3D Gaussian splat to be optimized in each frame. The parameters of these 3D Gaussian splats are optimized in the training of each frame, while those of the other splats are frozen. This means that the splats participating in the optimization process differ in each frame, to improve the realism of fine details. Compared with network-based methods, our method achieves better results with shorter training time. Compared with mesh-based methods, our method produces more realistic details within the same training time. Additionally, the ablation experiment confirms that our method effectively enhances the quality of details."
2503.05484,"We present DecoupledGaussian, a novel system that decouples static objects from their contacted surfaces captured in-the-wild videos, a key prerequisite for realistic Newtonian-based physical simulations. Unlike prior methods focused on synthetic data or elastic jittering along the contact surface, which prevent objects from fully detaching or moving independently, DecoupledGaussian allows for significant positional changes without being constrained by the initial contacted surface. Recognizing the limitations of current 2D inpainting tools for restoring 3D locations, our approach proposes joint Poisson fields to repair and expand the Gaussians of both objects and contacted scenes after separation. This is complemented by a multi-carve strategy to refine the object's geometry. Our system enables realistic simulations of decoupling motions, collisions, and fractures driven by user-specified impulses, supporting complex interactions within and across multiple scenes. We validate DecoupledGaussian through a comprehensive user study and quantitative benchmarks. This system enhances digital interaction with objects and scenes in real-world environments, benefiting industries such as VR, robotics, and autonomous driving.

2503.05511,"Novel view synthesis (NVS) from multiple captured photos of an object is a widely studied problem. Achieving high quality typically requires dense sampling of input views, which can lead to frustrating manual labor. Manually positioning cameras to maintain an optimal desired distribution can be difficult for humans, and if a good distribution is found, it is not easy to replicate. Additionally, the captured data can suffer from motion blur and defocus due to human error. In this paper, we use a lightweight object capture pipeline to reduce the manual workload and standardize the acquisition setup, with a consumer turntable to carry the object and a tripod to hold the camera. Of course, turntables and gantry systems have been frequently used to automatically capture dense samples under various views and lighting conditions; the key difference is that we use a turntable under natural environment lighting. This way, we can easily capture hundreds of valid images in several minutes without hands-on effort. However, in the object reference frame, the light conditions vary (rotate); this does not match the assumptions of standard NVS methods like 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). We design a neural radiance representation conditioned on light rotations, which addresses this issue and allows rendering with novel light rotations as an additional benefit. We further study the behavior of rotations and find optimal capturing strategies. We demonstrate our pipeline using 3DGS as the underlying framework, achieving higher quality and showcasing the method's potential for novel lighting and harmonization tasks."
2503.06784,"This paper tackles the problem of generating representations of underwater 3D terrain. Off-the-shelf generative models, trained on Internet-scale data but not on specialized underwater images, exhibit downgraded realism, as images of the seafloor are relatively uncommon. To this end, we introduce DreamSea, a generative model to generate hyper-realistic underwater scenes. DreamSea is trained on real-world image databases collected from underwater robot surveys. Images from these surveys contain massive real seafloor observations and covering large areas, but are prone to noise and artifacts from the real world. We extract 3D geometry and semantics from the data with visual foundation models, and train a diffusion model that generates realistic seafloor images in RGBD channels, conditioned on novel fractal distribution-based latent embeddings. We then fuse the generated images into a 3D map, building a 3DGS model supervised by 2D diffusion priors which allows photorealistic novel view rendering. DreamSea is rigorously evaluated, demonstrating the ability to robustly generate large-scale underwater scenes that are consistent, diverse, and photorealistic. Our work drives impact in multiple domains, spanning filming, gaming, and robot simulation."
2503.07191,"Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have revolutionized scene reconstruction, opening new possibilities for 3D steganography by hiding 3D secrets within 3D covers. The key challenge in steganography is ensuring imperceptibility while maintaining high-fidelity reconstruction. However, existing methods often suffer from detectability risks and utilize only suboptimal 3DGS features, limiting their full potential. We propose a novel end-to-end key-secured 3D steganography framework (KeySS) that jointly optimizes a 3DGS model and a key-secured decoder for secret reconstruction. Our approach reveals that Gaussian features contribute unequally to secret hiding. The framework incorporates a key-controllable mechanism enabling multi-secret hiding and unauthorized access prevention, while systematically exploring optimal feature update to balance fidelity and security. To rigorously evaluate steganographic imperceptibility beyond conventional 2D metrics, we introduce 3D-Sinkhorn distance analysis, which quantifies distributional differences between original and steganographic Gaussian parameters in the representation space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both cover and secret reconstruction while maintaining high security levels, advancing the field of 3D steganography.

2503.073,"Photo finishing tuning aims to automate the manual tuning process of the photo finishing pipeline, like Adobe Lightroom or Darktable. Previous works either use zeroth-order optimization, which is slow when the set of parameters increases, or rely on a differentiable proxy of the target finishing pipeline, which is hard to train. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel goal-conditioned reinforcement learning framework for efficiently tuning parameters using a goal image as a condition. Unlike previous approaches, our tuning framework does not rely on any proxy and treats the photo finishing pipeline as a black box. Utilizing a trained reinforcement learning policy, it can efficiently find the desired set of parameters within just 10 queries, while optimization based approaches normally take 200 queries. Furthermore, our architecture utilizes a goal image to guide the iterative tuning of pipeline parameters, allowing for flexible conditioning on pixel-aligned target images, style images, or any other visually representable goals. We conduct detailed experiments on photo finishing tuning and photo stylization tuning tasks, demonstrating the advantages of our method. Project website:this https URL."
2503.08037,"Simple as it seems, moving an object to another location within an image is, in fact, a challenging image-editing task that requires re-harmonizing the lighting, adjusting the pose based on perspective, accurately filling occluded regions, and ensuring coherent synchronization of shadows and reflections while maintaining the object identity. In this paper, we present ObjectMover, a generative model that can perform object movement in highly challenging scenes. Our key insight is that we model this task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and fine-tune a video generation model to leverage its knowledge of consistent object generation across video frames. We show that with this approach, our model is able to adjust to complex real-world scenarios, handling extreme lighting harmonization and object effect movement. As large-scale data for object movement are unavailable, we construct a data generation pipeline using a modern game engine to synthesize high-quality data pairs. We further propose a multi-task learning strategy that enables training on real-world video data to improve the model generalization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ObjectMover achieves outstanding results and adapts well to real-world scenarios."

2503.0837,"This paper presents Ev-Layout, a novel large-scale event-based multi-modal dataset designed for indoor layout estimation and tracking. Ev-Layout makes key contributions to the community by: Utilizing a hybrid data collection platform (with a head-mounted display and VR interface) that integrates both RGB and bio-inspired event cameras to capture indoor layouts in motion. Incorporating time-series data from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and ambient lighting conditions recorded during data collection to highlight the potential impact of motion speed and lighting on layout estimation accuracy. The dataset consists of 2.5K sequences, including over 771.3K RGB images and 10 billion event data points. Of these, 39K images are annotated with indoor layouts, enabling research in both event-based and video-based indoor layout estimation. Based on the dataset, we propose an event-based layout estimation pipeline with a novel event-temporal distribution feature module to effectively aggregate the spatio-temporal information from events. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal feature fusion module that can be easily integrated into a transformer module for fusion purposes. Finally, we conduct benchmarking and extensive experiments on the Ev-Layout dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of dynamic indoor layout estimation compared to existing event-based methods."
2503.08417,"Despite recent advancements in learning-based motion in-betweening, a key limitation has been overlooked: the requirement for character-specific datasets. In this work, we introduce AnyMoLe, a novel method that addresses this limitation by leveraging video diffusion models to generate motion in-between frames for arbitrary characters without external data. Our approach employs a two-stage frame generation process to enhance contextual understanding. Furthermore, to bridge the domain gap between real-world and rendered character animations, we introduce ICAdapt, a fine-tuning technique for video diffusion models. Additionally, we propose a ``motion-video mimicking'' optimization technique, enabling seamless motion generation for characters with arbitrary joint structures using 2D and 3D-aware features. AnyMoLe significantly reduces data dependency while generating smooth and realistic transitions, making it applicable to a wide range of motion in-betweening tasks."
2503.08434,"Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image models have revolutionized creative fields by generating visually captivating outputs from textual prompts; however, while traditional photography offers precise control over camera settings to shape visual aesthetics - such as depth-of-field via aperture - current diffusion models typically rely on prompt engineering to mimic such effects. This approach often results in crude approximations and inadvertently alters the scene content. In this work, we propose Bokeh Diffusion, a scene-consistent bokeh control framework that explicitly conditions a diffusion model on a physical defocus blur parameter. To overcome the scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera settings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild images with synthetic blur augmentations, providing diverse scenes and subjects as well as supervision to learn the separation of image content from lens blur. Central to our framework is our grounded self-attention mechanism, trained on image pairs with different bokeh levels of the same scene, which enables blur strength to be adjusted in both directions while preserving the underlying scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables flexible, lens-like blur control, supports downstream applications such as real image editing via inversion, and generalizes effectively across both Stable Diffusion and FLUX architectures."
2503.08678,"We introduce GarmentCrafter, a new approach that enables non-professional users to create and modify 3D garments from a single-view image. While recent advances in image generation have facilitated 2D garment design, creating and editing 3D garments remains challenging for non-professional users. Existing methods for single-view 3D reconstruction often rely on pre-trained generative models to synthesize novel views conditioning on the reference image and camera pose, yet they lack cross-view consistency, failing to capture the internal relationships across different views. In this paper, we tackle this challenge through progressive depth prediction and image warping to approximate novel views. Subsequently, we train a multi-view diffusion model to complete occluded and unknown clothing regions, informed by the evolving camera pose. By jointly inferring RGB and depth, GarmentCrafter enforces inter-view coherence and reconstructs precise geometries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual fidelity and inter-view coherence compared to state-of-the-art single-view 3D garment reconstruction methods."
2503.08724,"Implicit neural representations have emerged as a powerful approach for encoding complex geometries as continuous functions. These implicit models are widely used in computer vision and 3D content creation, but their integration into scientific computing workflows, such as finite element or finite volume simulations, remains limited. One reason is that conventional simulation pipelines require explicit geometric inputs (meshes), forcing INR-based shapes to be converted to meshes--a step that introduces approximation errors, computational overhead, and significant manual effort. Immersed boundary methods partially alleviate this issue by allowing simulations on background grids without body-fitted meshes. However, they still require an explicit boundary description and can suffer from numerical artifacts, such as sliver cut cells. The shifted boundary method (SBM) eliminates the need for explicit geometry by using grid-aligned surrogate boundaries, making it inherently compatible with implicit shape representations. Here, we present a framework that directly couples neural implicit geometries with SBM to perform high-fidelity fluid flow simulations without any intermediate mesh generation. By leveraging neural network inference, our approach computes the surrogate boundary and distance vectors required by SBM on-the-fly directly from the INR, thus completely bypassing traditional geometry processing. We demonstrate this approach on canonical 2D and 3D flow benchmarks (lid-driven cavity flows) and complex geometries (gyroids, the Stanford bunny, and AI-generated shapes), achieving simulation accuracy comparable to conventional mesh-based methods. This work highlights a novel pathway for integrating AI-driven geometric representations into computational physics, establishing INRs as a versatile and scalable tool for simulations and removing a long-standing bottleneck in geometry handling."
2503.08929,"Accurate and efficient 3D mapping of large-scale outdoor environments from LiDAR measurements is a fundamental challenge in robotics, particularly towards ensuring smooth and artifact-free surface reconstructions. Although the state-of-the-art methods focus on memory-efficient neural representations for high-fidelity surface generation, they often fail to produce artifact-free manifolds, with artifacts arising due to noisy and sparse inputs. To address this issue, we frame surface mapping as a physics-informed energy optimization problem, enforcing surface smoothness by optimizing an energy functional that penalizes sharp surface ridges. Specifically, we propose a deep learning based approach that learns the signed distance field (SDF) of the surface manifold from raw LiDAR point clouds using a physics-informed loss function that optimizes the $L_2$-Hessian energy of the surface. Our learning framework includes a hierarchical octree based input feature encoding and a multi-scale neural network to iteratively refine the signed distance field at different scales of resolution. Lastly, we introduce a test-time refinement strategy to correct topological inconsistencies and edge distortions that can arise in the generated mesh. We propose a \texttt{CUDA}-accelerated least-squares optimization that locally adjusts vertex positions to enforce feature-preserving smoothing. We evaluate our approach on large-scale outdoor datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of improved accuracy and smoothness.

2503.09019,"This paper proposes a method to design protective foam for packaging 3D objects. Users first load a 3D object and define a block-based design space by setting the block resolution and the size of each block. The system then constructs a block map in the space using depth textures of the input object, separates the map into two regions, and outputs the regions as foams. The proposed method is fast and stable, allowing the user to interactively make protective foams. The generated foam is a height field in each direction, so the foams can easily be fabricated using various materials, such as LEGO blocks, sponge with slits, glass, and wood. This paper shows some examples of fabrication results to demonstrate the robustness of our system. In addition, we conducted a user study and confirmed that our system is effective for manually designing protective foams envisioned by users."
2503.0913,"This paper presents InteractEdit, a novel framework for zero-shot Human-Object Interaction (HOI) editing, addressing the challenging task of transforming an existing interaction in an image into a new, desired interaction while preserving the identities of the subject and object. Unlike simpler image editing scenarios such as attribute manipulation, object replacement or style transfer, HOI editing involves complex spatial, contextual, and relational dependencies inherent in humans-objects interactions. Existing methods often overfit to the source image structure, limiting their ability to adapt to the substantial structural modifications demanded by new interactions. To address this, InteractEdit decomposes each scene into subject, object, and background components, then employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and selective fine-tuning to preserve pretrained interaction priors while learning the visual identity of the source image. This regularization strategy effectively balances interaction edits with identity consistency. We further introduce IEBench, the most comprehensive benchmark for HOI editing, which evaluates both interaction editing and identity preservation. Our extensive experiments show that InteractEdit significantly outperforms existing methods, establishing a strong baseline for future HOI editing research and unlocking new possibilities for creative and practical applications. Code will be released upon publication."
2503.09464,"Neural reconstruction models for autonomous driving simulation have made significant strides in recent years, with dynamic models becoming increasingly prevalent. However, these models are typically limited to handling in-domain objects closely following their original trajectories. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of neural reconstruction with physics-based rendering. This method enables the virtual placement of traditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to environmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for road surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates through our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the superior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a customized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived from a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS training. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera appearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training parallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater than or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface normals, and depth maps. During simulation, it supports a rasterization-based rendering backend with depth-based composition and multiple camera models for real-time camera simulation, as well as a ray-traced backend for precise LiDAR simulation."
2503.0963,"Diffusion models have transformed image generation, yet controlling their outputs to reliably erase undesired concepts remains challenging. Existing approaches usually require task-specific training and struggle to generalize across both concrete (e.g., objects) and abstract (e.g., styles) concepts. We propose CASteer (Cross-Attention Steering), a training-free framework for concept erasure in diffusion models using steering vectors to influence hidden representations dynamically. CASteer precomputes concept-specific steering vectors by averaging neural activations from images generated for each target concept. During inference, it dynamically applies these vectors to suppress undesired concepts only when they appear, ensuring that unrelated regions remain unaffected. This selective activation enables precise, context-aware erasure without degrading overall image quality. This approach achieves effective removal of harmful or unwanted content across a wide range of visual concepts, all without model retraining. CASteer outperforms state-of-the-art concept erasure techniques while preserving unrelated content and minimizing unintended effects. Pseudocode is provided in the supplementary."
2503.09631,"We present V2M4, a novel 4D reconstruction method that directly generates a usable 4D mesh animation asset from a single monocular video. Unlike existing approaches that rely on priors from multi-view image and video generation models, our method is based on native 3D mesh generation models. Naively applying 3D mesh generation models to generate a mesh for each frame in a 4D task can lead to issues such as incorrect mesh poses, misalignment of mesh appearance, and inconsistencies in mesh geometry and texture maps. To address these problems, we propose a structured workflow that includes camera search and mesh reposing, condition embedding optimization for mesh appearance refinement, pairwise mesh registration for topology consistency, and global texture map optimization for texture consistency. Our method outputs high-quality 4D animated assets that are compatible with mainstream graphics and game software. Experimental results across a variety of animation types and motion amplitudes demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our method. Project page:this https URL."
2503.09634,"Structural and appearance changes in brain imaging over time are crucial indicators of neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. The rapid advancement of large-scale generative models provides a promising backbone for modeling these complex global and local changes in brain images, such as transforming the age of a source image to a target age. However, current generative models, typically trained on independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data, may struggle to maintain intra-subject spatiotemporal consistency during transformations. We propose the Identity-Preserving Longitudinal Diffusion Model (IP-LDM), designed to accurately transform brain ages while preserving subject identity. Our approach involves first extracting the identity representation from the source image. Then, conditioned on the target age, the latent diffusion model learns to generate the age-transformed target image. To ensure consistency within the same subject over time, we regularize the identity representation using a triplet contrastive formulation. Our experiments on both elderly and infant brain datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing conditional generative models, producing realistic age transformations while preserving intra-subject identity."
2503.09635,"We present FPGS, a feed-forward photorealistic style transfer method of large-scale radiance fields represented by Gaussian Splatting. FPGS, stylizes large-scale 3D scenes with arbitrary, multiple style reference images without additional optimization while preserving multi-view consistency and real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussians. Prior arts required tedious per-style optimization or time-consuming per-scene training stage and were limited to small-scale 3D scenes. FPGS efficiently stylizes large-scale 3D scenes by introducing a style-decomposed 3D feature field, which inherits AdaIN's feed-forward stylization machinery, supporting arbitrary style reference images. Furthermore, FPGS supports multi-reference stylization with the semantic correspondence matching and local AdaIN, which adds diverse user control for 3D scene styles. FPGS also preserves multi-view consistency by applying semantic matching and style transfer processes directly onto queried features in 3D space. In experiments, we demonstrate that FPGS achieves favorable photorealistic quality scene stylization for large-scale static and dynamic 3D scenes with diverse reference images.

2503.0964,"Rendering realistic human-object interactions (HOIs) from sparse-view inputs is challenging due to occlusions and incomplete observations, yet crucial for various real-world applications. Existing methods always struggle with either low rendering qualities (\eg, visual fidelity and physically plausible HOIs) or high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose HOGS (Human-Object Rendering via 3D Gaussian Splatting), a novel framework for efficient and physically plausible HOI rendering from sparse views. Specifically, HOGS combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with a physics-aware optimization process. It incorporates a Human Pose Refinement module for accurate pose estimation and a Sparse-View Human-Object Contact Prediction module for efficient contact region identification. This combination enables coherent joint rendering of human and object Gaussians while enforcing physically plausible interactions. Extensive experiments on the HODome dataset demonstrate that HOGS achieves superior rendering quality, efficiency, and physical plausibility compared to existing methods. We further show its extensibility to hand-object grasp rendering tasks, presenting its broader applicability to articulated object interactions."
2503.09641,"This paper presents SANA-Sprint, an efficient diffusion model for ultra-fast text-to-image (T2I) generation. SANA-Sprint is built on a pre-trained foundation model and augmented with hybrid distillation, dramatically reducing inference steps from 20 to 1-4. We introduce three key innovations: (1) We propose a training-free approach that transforms a pre-trained flow-matching model for continuous-time consistency distillation (sCM), eliminating costly training from scratch and achieving high training efficiency. Our hybrid distillation strategy combines sCM with latent adversarial distillation (LADD): sCM ensures alignment with the teacher model, while LADD enhances single-step generation fidelity. (2) SANA-Sprint is a unified step-adaptive model that achieves high-quality generation in 1-4 steps, eliminating step-specific training and improving efficiency. (3) We integrate ControlNet with SANA-Sprint for real-time interactive image generation, enabling instant visual feedback for user interaction. SANA-Sprint establishes a new Pareto frontier in speed-quality tradeoffs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.59 FID and 0.74 GenEval in only 1 step - outperforming FLUX-schnell (7.94 FID / 0.71 GenEval) while being 10x faster (0.1s vs 1.1s on H100). It also achieves 0.1s (T2I) and 0.25s (ControlNet) latency for 1024 x 1024 images on H100, and 0.31s (T2I) on an RTX 4090, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and potential for AI-powered consumer applications (AIPC).

Existing hair capture methods struggle to balance photorealistic rendering with relighting capabilities. Analytical material models, while physically grounded, often fail to fully capture appearance details. Conversely, neural rendering approaches excel at view synthesis but generalize poorly to novel lighting conditions. GroomLight addresses this challenge by combining the strengths of both paradigms. It employs an extended hair BSDF model to capture primary light transport and a light-aware residual model to reconstruct the remaining details. We further propose a hybrid inverse rendering pipeline to optimize both components, enabling high-fidelity relighting, view synthesis, and material editing. Extensive evaluations on real-world hair data demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our method."
2503.10637,"Distilled diffusion models suffer from a critical limitation: reduced sample diversity compared to their base counterparts. In this work, we uncover that despite this diversity loss, distilled models retain the fundamental concept representations of base models. We demonstrate control distillation - where control mechanisms like Concept Sliders and LoRAs trained on base models can be seamlessly transferred to distilled models and vice-versa, effectively distilling control without any retraining. This preservation of representational structure prompted our investigation into the mechanisms of sample-diversity collapse during distillation. To understand how distillation affects diversity, we utilize $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{0}$ visualization as an analysis and debugging tool to reveal how models predict final outputs at intermediate steps. Through $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{0}$ visualization, we identify generation artifacts, inconsistencies, and demonstrate that initial diffusion timesteps disproportionately determine output diversity, while later steps primarily refine details. Based on these insights, we introduce diversity distillation - a hybrid inference approach that strategically employs the base model for only the first critical timestep before transitioning to the efficient distilled model. Our experiments demonstrate that this simple modification not only restores the diversity capabilities from base to distilled models but surprisingly exceeds it, while maintaining nearly the computational efficiency of distilled inference, all without requiring additional training or model modifications.

2503.10857,"Despite the promising results of large multimodal models (LMMs) in complex vision-language tasks that require knowledge, reasoning, and perception abilities together, we surprisingly found that these models struggle with simple tasks on infographics that require perception only. As existing benchmarks primarily focus on end tasks that require various abilities, they provide limited, fine-grained insights into the limitations of the models' perception abilities. To address this gap, we leverage the theory of graphical perception, an approach used to study how humans decode visual information encoded on charts and graphs, to develop an evaluation framework for analyzing gaps in LMMs' perception abilities in charts. With automated task generation and response evaluation designs, our framework enables comprehensive and controlled testing of LMMs' graphical perception across diverse chart types, visual elements, and task types. We apply our framework to evaluate and diagnose the perception capabilities of state-of-the-art LMMs at three granularity levels (chart, visual element, and pixel). Our findings underscore several critical limitations of current state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o: their inability to (1) generalize across chart types, (2) understand fundamental visual elements, and (3) cross reference values within a chart. These insights provide guidance for future improvements in perception abilities of LMMs. The evaluation framework and labeled data are publicly available atthis https URL."
2503.11054,"While diffusion models show promising results in image editing given a target prompt, achieving both prompt fidelity and background preservation remains difficult. Recent works have introduced score distillation techniques that leverage the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models to solve this task without additional fine-tuning. However, these methods often struggle with tasks such as object insertion. Our investigation of these failures reveals significant variations in gradient magnitude and spatial distribution, making hyperparameter tuning highly input-specific or unsuccessful. To address this, we propose two simple yet effective modifications: attention-based spatial regularization and gradient filtering-normalization, both aimed at reducing these variations during gradient updates. Experimental results show our method outperforms state-of-the-art score distillation techniques in prompt fidelity, improving successful edits while preserving the background. Users also preferred our method over state-of-the-art techniques across three metrics, and by 58-64% overall."
2503.11629,"We introduce TreeMeshGPT, an autoregressive Transformer designed to generate high-quality artistic meshes aligned with input point clouds. Instead of the conventional next-token prediction in autoregressive Transformer, we propose a novel Autoregressive Tree Sequencing where the next input token is retrieved from a dynamically growing tree structure that is built upon the triangle adjacency of faces within the mesh. Our sequencing enables the mesh to extend locally from the last generated triangular face at each step, and therefore reduces training difficulty and improves mesh quality. Our approach represents each triangular face with two tokens, achieving a compression rate of approximately 22% compared to the naive face tokenization. This efficient tokenization enables our model to generate highly detailed artistic meshes with strong point cloud conditioning, surpassing previous methods in both capacity and fidelity. Furthermore, our method generates mesh with strong normal orientation constraints, minimizing flipped normals commonly encountered in previous methods.

2503.11801,"We present Diffuse-CLoC, a guided diffusion framework for physics-based look-ahead control that enables intuitive, steerable, and physically realistic motion generation. While existing kinematics motion generation with diffusion models offer intuitive steering capabilities with inference-time conditioning, they often fail to produce physically viable motions. In contrast, recent diffusion-based control policies have shown promise in generating physically realizable motion sequences, but the lack of kinematics prediction limits their steerability. Diffuse-CLoC addresses these challenges through a key insight: modeling the joint distribution of states and actions within a single diffusion model makes action generation steerable by conditioning it on the predicted states. This approach allows us to leverage established conditioning techniques from kinematic motion generation while producing physically realistic motions. As a result, we achieve planning capabilities without the need for a high-level planner. Our method handles a diverse set of unseen long-horizon downstream tasks through a single pre-trained model, including static and dynamic obstacle avoidance, motion in-betweening, and task-space control. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the traditional hierarchical framework of high-level motion diffusion and low-level tracking."
2503.11978,"The increasing popularity of personalized avatar systems, such as Snapchat Bitmojis and Apple Memojis, highlights the growing demand for digital self-representation. Despite their widespread use, existing avatar platforms face significant limitations, including restricted expressivity due to predefined assets, tedious customization processes, or inefficient rendering requirements. Addressing these shortcomings, we introduce Snapmoji, an avatar generation system that instantly creates animatable, dual-stylized avatars from a selfie. We propose Gaussian Domain Adaptation (GDA), which is pre-trained on large-scale Gaussian models using 3D data from sources such as Objaverse and fine-tuned with 2D style transfer tasks, endowing it with a rich 3D prior. This enables Snapmoji to transform a selfie into a primary stylized avatar, like the Bitmoji style, and apply a secondary style, such as Plastic Toy or Alien, all while preserving the user's identity and the primary style's integrity. Our system is capable of producing 3D Gaussian avatars that support dynamic animation, including accurate facial expression transfer. Designed for efficiency, Snapmoji achieves selfie-to-avatar conversion in just 0.9 seconds and supports real-time interactions on mobile devices at 30 to 40 frames per second. Extensive testing confirms that Snapmoji outperforms existing methods in versatility and speed, making it a convenient tool for automatic avatar creation in various styles."
2503.12174,"Projector-camera systems (ProCams) simulation aims to model the physical project-and-capture process and associated scene parameters of a ProCams, and is crucial for spatial augmented reality (SAR) applications such as ProCams relighting and projector compensation. Recent advances use an end-to-end neural network to learn the project-and-capture process. However, these neural network-based methods often implicitly encapsulate scene parameters, such as surface material, gamma, and white balance in the network parameters, and are less interpretable and hard for novel scene simulation. Moreover, neural networks usually learn the indirect illumination implicitly in an image-to-image translation way which leads to poor performance in simulating complex projection effects such as soft-shadow and interreflection. In this paper, we introduce a novel path tracing-based differentiable projector-camera systems (DPCS), offering a differentiable ProCams simulation method that explicitly integrates multi-bounce path tracing. Our DPCS models the physical project-and-capture process using differentiable physically-based rendering (PBR), enabling the scene parameters to be explicitly decoupled and learned using much fewer samples. Moreover, our physically-based method not only enables high-quality downstream ProCams tasks, such as ProCams relighting and projector compensation, but also allows novel scene simulation using the learned scene parameters. In experiments, DPCS demonstrates clear advantages over previous approaches in ProCams simulation, offering better interpretability, more efficient handling of complex interreflection and shadow, and requiring fewer training samples."

Additionally, we introduce a \emph{Temporal Second-Order Loss} to suppress abrupt style variations across consecutive frames. Our experiments on DAVIS and UCF101 show that the proposed approach outperforms competing methods in terms of style consistency, smoothness, and computational efficiency. We believe our new framework paves the way for real-time text-driven video stylization with state-of-the-art perceptual results."
2503.12553,"Recent advances in single-view 3D scene reconstruction have highlighted the challenges in capturing fine geometric details and ensuring structural consistency, particularly in high-fidelity outdoor scene modeling. This paper presents Niagara, a new single-view 3D scene reconstruction framework that can faithfully reconstruct challenging outdoor scenes from a single input image for the first time.Our approach integrates monocular depth and normal estimation as input, which substantially improves its ability to capture fine details, mitigating common issues like geometric detail loss and deformation.Additionally, we introduce a geometric affine field (GAF) and 3D self-attention as geometry-constraint, which combines the structural properties of explicit geometry with the adaptability of implicit feature fields, striking a balance between efficient rendering and high-fidelity reconstruction.Our framework finally proposes a specialized encoder-decoder architecture, where a depth-based 3D Gaussian decoder is proposed to predict 3D Gaussian parameters, which can be used for novel view synthesis. Extensive results and analyses suggest that our Niagara surpasses prior SoTA approaches such as Flash3D in both single-view and dual-view settings, significantly enhancing the geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, especially in outdoor scenes."
2503.12814,"We present a versatile latent representation that enables physically simulated character to efficiently utilize motion priors. To build a powerful motion embedding that is shared across multiple tasks, the physics controller should employ rich latent space that is easily explored and capable of generating high-quality motion. We propose integrating continuous and discrete latent representations to build a versatile motion prior that can be adapted to a wide range of challenging control tasks. Specifically, we build a discrete latent model to capture distinctive posterior distribution without collapse, and simultaneously augment the sampled vector with the continuous residuals to generate high-quality, smooth motion without jittering. We further incorporate Residual Vector Quantization, which not only maximizes the capacity of the discrete motion prior, but also efficiently abstracts the action space during the task learning phase. We demonstrate that our agent can produce diverse yet smooth motions simply by traversing the learned motion prior through unconditional motion generation. Furthermore, our model robustly satisfies sparse goal conditions with highly expressive natural motions, including head-mounted device tracking and motion in-betweening at irregular intervals, which could not be achieved with existing latent representations."
2503.13541,"In this paper, we propose DDPM-Polycube, a generative polycube creation approach based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) for generating high-quality hexahedral (hex) meshes and constructing volumetric splines. Unlike DL-Polycube methods that rely on predefined polycube structure templates, DDPM-Polycube models the deformation from input geometry to its corresponding polycube structures as a denoising task. By learning the deformation characteristics of simple geometric primitives (a cube and a cube with a hole), the DDPM-Polycube model progressively reconstructs polycube structures from input geometry by removing non-standard Gaussian noise. Once valid polycube structures are generated, they are used for surface segmentation and parametric mapping to generate high-quality hex meshes. Truncated hierarchical B-splines are then applied to construct volumetric splines that satisfy the requirements of isogeometric analysis (IGA). Experimental results demonstrate that DDPM-Polycube model can directly generate polycube structures from input geometries, even when the topology of these geometries falls outside its trained range. This provides greater generalization and adaptability for diverse engineering geometries. Overall, this research shows the potential of diffusion models in advancing mesh generation and IGA applications."
2503.13579,"Despite the growing accessibility of skeletal motion data, integrating it for animating character meshes remains challenging due to diverse configurations of both skeletons and meshes. Specifically, the body scale and bone lengths of the skeleton should be adjusted in accordance with the size and proportions of the mesh, ensuring that all joints are accurately positioned within the character mesh. Furthermore, defining skinning weights is complicated by variations in skeletal configurations, such as the number of joints and their hierarchy, as well as differences in mesh configurations, including their connectivity and shapes. While existing approaches have made efforts to automate this process, they hardly address the variations in both skeletal and mesh configurations. In this paper, we present a novel method for the automatic rigging and skinning of character meshes using skeletal motion data, accommodating arbitrary configurations of both meshes and skeletons. The proposed method predicts the optimal skeleton aligned with the size and proportion of the mesh as well as defines skinning weights for various mesh-skeleton configurations, without requiring explicit supervision tailored to each of them. By incorporating Diffusion 3D Features (Diff3F) as semantic descriptors of character meshes, our method achieves robust generalization across different configurations. To assess the performance of our method in comparison to existing approaches, we conducted comprehensive evaluations encompassing both quantitative and qualitative analyses, specifically examining the predicted skeletons, skinning weights, and deformation quality."
2503.13961,"Differentiable rendering enables efficient optimization by allowing gradients to be computed through the rendering process, facilitating 3D reconstruction, inverse rendering and neural scene representation learning. To ensure differentiability, existing solutions approximate or re-formulate traditional rendering operations using smooth, probabilistic proxies such as volumes or Gaussian primitives. Consequently, they struggle to preserve sharp edges due to the lack of explicit boundary definitions. We present a novel hybrid representation, Bézier Gaussian Triangle (BG-Triangle), that combines Bézier triangle-based vector graphics primitives with Gaussian-based probabilistic models, to maintain accurate shape modeling while conducting resolution-independent differentiable rendering. We present a robust and effective discontinuity-aware rendering technique to reduce uncertainties at object boundaries. We also employ an adaptive densification and pruning scheme for efficient training while reliably handling level-of-detail (LoD) variations. Experiments show that BG-Triangle achieves comparable rendering quality as 3DGS but with superior boundary preservation. More importantly, BG-Triangle uses a much smaller number of primitives than its alternatives, showcasing the benefits of vectorized graphics primitives and the potential to bridge the gap between classic and emerging representations."
2503.1404,"This work focuses on full-body co-speech gesture generation. Existing methods typically employ an autoregressive model accompanied by vector-quantized tokens for gesture generation, which results in information loss and compromises the realism of the generated gestures. To address this, inspired by the natural continuity of real-world human motion, we propose MAG, a novel multi-modal aligned framework for high-quality and diverse co-speech gesture synthesis without relying on discrete tokenization. Specifically, (1) we introduce a motion-text-audio-aligned variational autoencoder (MTA-VAE), which leverages pre-trained WavCaps' text and audio embeddings to enhance both semantic and rhythmic alignment with motion, ultimately producing more realistic gestures. (2) Building on this, we propose a multimodal masked autoregressive model (MMAG) that enables autoregressive modeling in continuous motion embeddings through diffusion without vector quantization. To further ensure multi-modal consistency, MMAG incorporates a hybrid granularity audio-text fusion block, which serves as conditioning for diffusion process. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that MAG achieves stateof-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively, producing highly realistic and diverse co-speechthis http URLcode will be released to facilitate future research."
2503.14375,"Generating structured ASCII art using computational techniques demands a careful interplay between aesthetic representation and computational precision, requiring models that can effectively translate visual information into symbolic text characters. Although Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this domain, the comparative performance of deep learning architectures and classical machine learning methods remains unexplored. This paper explores the application of contemporary ML and DL methods to generate structured ASCII art, focusing on three key criteria: fidelity, character classification accuracy, and output quality. We investigate deep learning architectures, including Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), ResNet, and MobileNetV2, alongside classical approaches such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), trained on an augmented synthetic dataset of ASCII characters. Our results show that complex neural network architectures often fall short in producing high-quality ASCII art, whereas classical machine learning classifiers, despite their simplicity, achieve performance similar to CNNs. Our findings highlight the strength of classical methods in bridging model simplicity with output quality, offering new insights into ASCII art synthesis and machine learning on image data with low dimensionality."
2503.14475,"The field of Novel View Synthesis has been revolutionized by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which enables high-quality scene reconstruction that can be rendered in real-time. 3DGS-based techniques typically suffer from high GPU memory and disk storage requirements which limits their practical application on consumer-grade devices. We propose Opti3DGS, a novel frequency-modulated coarse-to-fine optimization framework that aims to minimize the number of Gaussian primitives used to represent a scene, thus reducing memory and storage demands. Opti3DGS leverages image frequency modulation, initially enforcing a coarse scene representation and progressively refining it by modulating frequency details in the training images. On the baseline 3DGS, we demonstrate an average reduction of 62% in Gaussians, a 40% reduction in the training GPU memory requirements and a 20% reduction in optimization time without sacrificing the visual quality. Furthermore, we show that our method integrates seamlessly with many 3DGS-based techniques, consistently reducing the number of Gaussian primitives while maintaining, and often improving, visual quality. Additionally, Opti3DGS inherently produces a level-of-detail scene representation at no extra cost, a natural byproduct of the optimization pipeline. Results and code will be made publicly available."
2503.14485,"Video portrait relighting remains challenging because the results need to be both photorealistic and temporally stable. This typically requires a strong model design that can capture complex facial reflections as well as intensive training on a high-quality paired video dataset, such as dynamic one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). In this work, we introduce Lux Post Facto, a novel portrait video relighting method that produces both photorealistic and temporally consistent lighting effects. From the model side, we design a new conditional video diffusion model built upon state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model, alongside a new lighting injection mechanism to enable precise control. This way we leverage strong spatial and temporal generative capability to generate plausible solutions to the ill-posed relighting problem. Our technique uses a hybrid dataset consisting of static expression OLAT data and in-the-wild portrait performance videos to jointly learn relighting and temporal modeling. This avoids the need to acquire paired video data in different lighting conditions. Our extensive experiments show that our model produces state-of-the-art results both in terms of photorealism and temporal consistency."
2503.14756,"Despite recent advances in text-conditioned 3D indoor scene generation, there remain gaps in the evaluation of these methods. Existing metrics primarily assess the realism of generated scenes by comparing them to a set of ground-truth scenes, often overlooking alignment with the input text - a critical factor in determining how effectively a method meets user requirements. We present SceneEval, an evaluation framework designed to address this limitation. SceneEval includes metrics for both explicit user requirements, such as the presence of specific objects and their attributes described in the input text, and implicit expectations, like the absence of object collisions, providing a comprehensive assessment of scene quality. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce SceneEval-500, a dataset of scene descriptions with annotated ground-truth scene properties. We evaluate recent scene generation methods using SceneEval and demonstrate its ability to provide detailed assessments of the generated scenes, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement across multiple dimensions. Our results show that current methods struggle at generating scenes that meet user requirements, underscoring the need for further research in this direction."
2503.14845,"Adverse climate conditions pose significant challenges for autonomous systems, demanding reliable perception and decision-making across diverse environments. To better simulate these conditions, physically-based NeRF rendering methods have been explored for their ability to generate realistic scene representations. However, these methods suffer from slow rendering speeds and long preprocessing times, making them impractical for real-time testing and user interaction. This paper presents ClimateGS, a novel framework integrating 3D Gaussian representations with physical simulation to enable real-time climate effects rendering. The novelty of this work is threefold: 1) developing a linear transformation for 3D Gaussian photorealistic style transfer, enabling direct modification of spherical harmonics across bands for efficient and consistent style adaptation; 2) developing a joint training strategy for 3D style transfer, combining supervised and self-supervised learning to accelerate convergence while preserving original scene details; 3) developing a real-time rendering method for climate simulation, integrating physics-based effects with 3D Gaussian to achieve efficient and realistic rendering. We evaluate ClimateGS on MipNeRF360 and Tanks and Temples, demonstrating real-time rendering with comparable or superior visual quality to SOTA 2D/3D methods, making it suitable for interactive applications."
2503.14908,"Poster design is a critical medium for visual communication. Prior work has explored automatic poster design using deep learning techniques, but these approaches lack text accuracy, user customization, and aesthetic appeal, limiting their applicability in artistic domains such as movies and exhibitions, where both clear content delivery and visual impact are essential. To address these limitations, we present POSTA: a modular framework powered by diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for customized artistic poster generation. The framework consists of three modules. Background Diffusion creates a themed background based on user input. Design MLLM then generates layout and typography elements that align with and complement the background style. Finally, to enhance the poster's aesthetic appeal, ArtText Diffusion applies additional stylization to key text elements. The final result is a visually cohesive and appealing poster, with a fully modular process that allows for complete customization. To train our models, we develop the PosterArt dataset, comprising high-quality artistic posters annotated with layout, typography, and pixel-level stylized text segmentation. Our comprehensive experimental analysis demonstrates POSTA's exceptional controllability and design diversity, outperforming existing models in both text accuracy and aesthetic quality."
2503.15078,"We present a GPU-friendly framework for real-time implicit simulation of elastic material in the presence of frictional contacts. The integration of hyperelasticity, non-interpenetration contact, and friction in real-time simulations presents formidable nonlinear and non-smooth problems, which are highly challenging to solve. By incorporating nonlinear complementarity conditions within the local-global framework, we achieve rapid convergence in addressing these challenges. While the structure of local-global methods is not fully GPU-friendly, our proposal of a simple yet efficient solver with sparse presentation of the system inverse enables highly parallel computing while maintaining a fast convergence rate. Moreover, our novel splitting strategy for non-smooth indicators not only amplifies overall performance but also refines the complementarity preconditioner, enhancing the accuracy of frictional behavior modeling. Through extensive experimentation, the robustness of our framework in managing real-time contact scenarios, ranging from large-scale systems and extreme deformations to non-smooth contacts and precise friction interactions, has been validated. Compatible with a wide range of hyperelastic models, our approach maintains efficiency across both low and high stiffness materials. Despite its remarkable efficiency, robustness, and generality, our method is elegantly simple, with its core contributions grounded solely on standard matrix operations."
2503.15147,"Despite recent advances in text-to-image generation, controlling geometric layout and material properties in synthesized scenes remains challenging. We present a novel pipeline that first produces a G-buffer (albedo, normals, depth, roughness, and metallic) from a text prompt and then renders a final image through a modular neural network. This intermediate representation enables fine-grained editing: users can copy and paste within specific G-buffer channels to insert or reposition objects, or apply masks to the irradiance channel to adjust lighting locally. As a result, real objects can be seamlessly integrated into virtual scenes, and virtual objects can be placed into real environments with high fidelity. By separating scene decomposition from image rendering, our method offers a practical balance between detailed post-generation control and efficient text-driven synthesis. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a variety of examples, showing that G-buffer editing significantly extends the flexibility of text-guided image generation."
2503.15225,"The deployment of autonomous virtual avatars (in extended reality) and robots in human group activities -- such as rehabilitation therapy, sports, and manufacturing -- is expected to increase as these technologies become more pervasive. Designing cognitive architectures and control strategies to drive these agents requires realistic models of human motion. Furthermore, recent research has shown that each person exhibits a unique velocity signature, highlighting how individual motor behaviors are both rich in variability and internally consistent. However, existing models only provide simplified descriptions of human motor behavior, hindering the development of effective cognitive architectures. In this work, we first show that motion amplitude provides a valid and complementary characterization of individual motor signatures. Then, we propose a fully data-driven approach, based on long short-term memory neural networks, to generate original motion that captures the unique features of specific individuals. We validate the architecture using real human data from participants performing spontaneous oscillatory motion. Extensive analyses show that state-of-the-art Kuramoto-like models fail to replicate individual motor signatures, whereas our model accurately reproduces the velocity distribution and amplitude envelopes of the individual it was trained on, while remaining distinct from others."
2503.15557,"Creating expressive character animations is labor-intensive, requiring intricate manual adjustment of animators across space and time. Previous works on controllable motion generation often rely on a predefined set of dense spatio-temporal specifications (e.g., dense pelvis trajectories with exact per-frame timing), limiting practicality for animators. To process high-level intent and intuitive control in diverse scenarios, we propose a practical controllable motions synthesis framework that respects sparse and flexible keyjoint signals. Our approach employs a decomposed diffusion-based motion synthesis framework that first synthesizes keyjoint movements from sparse input control signals and then synthesizes full-body motion based on the completed keyjoint trajectories. The low-dimensional keyjoint movements can easily adapt to various control signal types, such as end-effector position for diverse goal-driven motion synthesis, or incorporate functional constraints on a subset of keyjoints. Additionally, we introduce a time-agnostic control formulation, eliminating the need for frame-specific timing annotations and enhancing control flexibility. Then, the shared second stage can synthesize a natural whole-body motion that precisely satisfies the task requirement from dense keyjoint movements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of sparse and flexible keyjoint control through comprehensive experiments on diverse datasets and scenarios."

2503.15586,"Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved impressive results on animating images of human subjects. However, most of that success has built on human-specific body pose representations and extensive training with labeled real videos. In this work, we extend the ability of such models to animate images of characters with more diverse skeletal topologies. Given a small number (3-5) of example frames showing the character in different poses with corresponding skeletal information, our model quickly infers a rig for that character that can generate images corresponding to new skeleton poses. We propose a procedural data generation pipeline that efficiently samples training data with diverse topologies on the fly. We use it, along with a novel skeleton representation, to train our model on articulated shapes spanning a large space of textures and topologies. Then during fine-tuning, our model rapidly adapts to unseen target characters and generalizes well to rendering new poses, both for realistic and more stylized cartoon appearances. To better evaluate performance on this novel and challenging task, we create the first 2D video dataset that contains both humanoid and non-humanoid subjects with per-frame keypoint annotations. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior quality of our results. Project page:this https URL"
2503.15809,"Recent advances in diffusion models have made significant progress in digital human generation. However, most existing models still struggle to maintain 3D consistency, temporal coherence, and motion accuracy. A key reason for these shortcomings is the limited representation ability of commonly used control signals(e.g., landmarks, depth maps, etc.). In addition, the lack of diversity in identity and pose variations in public datasets further hinders progress in this area. In this paper, we analyze the shortcomings of current control signals and introduce a novel control signal representation that is optimizable, dense, expressive, and 3D consistent. Our method embeds a learnable neural Gaussian onto a parametric head surface, which greatly enhances the consistency and expressiveness of diffusion-based head models. Regarding the dataset, we synthesize a large-scale dataset with multiple poses and identities. In addition, we use real/synthetic labels to effectively distinguish real and synthetic data, minimizing the impact of imperfections in synthetic data on the generated head images. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms existing methods in terms of realism, expressiveness, and 3D consistency.

From an input static 3D humanoid mesh and a text prompt describing the desired animation, we synthesize a corresponding video conditioned on a rendered image of the 3D mesh. We then employ an underlying SMPL representation to animate the corresponding 3D mesh according to the video-generated motion, based on our motion optimization. This enables a cost-effective and accessible solution to enable the synthesis of diverse and realistic 4D animations."
2503.16129,"We present a novel approach for controllable, region-specific style editing driven by textual prompts. Building upon the state-space style alignment framework introduced by \emph{StyleMamba}, our method integrates a semantic segmentation model into the style transfer pipeline. This allows users to selectively apply text-driven style changes to specific segments (e.g., ``turn the building into a cyberpunk tower'') while leaving other regions (e.g., ``people'' or ``trees'') unchanged. By incorporating region-wise condition vectors and a region-specific directional loss, our method achieves high-fidelity transformations that respect both semantic boundaries and user-driven style descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can flexibly handle complex scene stylizations in real-world scenarios, improving control and quality over purely global style transfer methods."
2503.16133,"Text-driven image style transfer has seen remarkable progress with methods leveraging cross-modal embeddings for fast, high-quality stylization. However, most existing pipelines assume a \emph{single} textual style prompt, limiting the range of artistic control and expressiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel \emph{multi-prompt style interpolation} framework that extends the recently introduced \textbf{StyleMamba} approach. Our method supports blending or interpolating among multiple textual prompts (eg, ``cubism,'' ``impressionism,'' and ``cartoon''), allowing the creation of nuanced or hybrid artistic styles within a \emph{single} image. We introduce a \textit{Multi-Prompt Embedding Mixer} combined with \textit{Adaptive Blending Weights} to enable fine-grained control over the spatial and semantic influence of each style. Further, we propose a \emph{Hierarchical Masked Directional Loss} to refine region-specific style consistency.

2503.16177,"In large-scale scene reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting, it is common to partition the scene into multiple smaller regions and reconstruct them individually. However, existing division methods are occlusion-agnostic, meaning that each region may contain areas with severe occlusions. As a result, the cameras within those regions are less correlated, leading to a low average contribution to the overall reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an occlusion-aware scene division strategy that clusters training cameras based on their positions and co-visibilities to acquire multiple regions. Cameras in such regions exhibit stronger correlations and a higher average contribution, facilitating high-quality scene reconstruction. We further propose a region-based rendering technique to accelerate large scene rendering, which culls Gaussians invisible to the region where the viewpoint is located. Such a technique significantly speeds up the rendering without compromising quality. Extensive experiments on multiple large scenes show that our method achieves superior reconstruction results with faster rendering speed compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

VerbDiff is a novel text-to-image generation model that weakens the bias between interaction words and objects, enhancing the understanding of interactions. Specifically, we disentangle various interaction words from frequency-based anchor words and leverage localized interaction regions from generated images to help the model better capture semantics in distinctive words without extra conditions. Our approach enables the model to accurately understand the intended interaction between humans and objects, producing high-quality images with accurate interactions aligned with specified verbs.

This work introduces a new differentiable VG representation, dubbed Bézier Splatting, that enables fast yet high-fidelity VG rasterization. Bézier Splatting samples 2D Gaussians along Bézier curves, which naturally provide positional gradients at object boundaries. Thanks to the efficient splatting-based differentiable rasterizer, Bézier Splatting achieves 30x and 150x faster per forward and backward rasterization step for open curves compared to DiffVG. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive pruning and densification strategy that dynamically adjusts the spatial distribution of curves to escape local minima, further improving VG quality. Furthermore, our new VG representation supports conversion to standard XML-based SVG format, enhancing interoperability with existing VG tools and pipelines. Experimental results show that Bézier Splatting significantly outperforms existing methods with better visual fidelity and significant optimization speedup."

While recent methods leverage text-to-image diffusion models for texturing, they often struggle to preserve the appearance of the source texture during texture transfer. We present \ourmethod, a novel approach that learns a volumetric texture field from a single textured mesh by mapping semantic features to surface colors. Using an efficient triplane-based architecture, our method enables semantic-aware texture transfer to a novel target mesh. Despite training on just one example, it generalizes effectively to diverse shapes within the same category. Extensive evaluation on our newly created benchmark dataset shows that \ourmethod{} achieves superior texture transfer quality and fast inference times compared to existing methods. Our approach advances single-example texture transfer, providing a practical solution for maintaining visual coherence across related 3D models in applications like game development and simulation."

Previous efforts to accelerate 3DGS rely on dedicated accelerators that require substantial integration overhead and hardware costs. This work proposes an acceleration strategy that leverages the similarities between the 3DGS pipeline and the highly optimized conventional graphics pipeline in modern GPUs. Instead of developing a dedicated accelerator, we enhance existing GPU rasterizer hardware to efficiently support 3DGS operations. Our results demonstrate a 23$\times$ increase in processing speed and a 24$\times$ reduction in energy consumption, with improvements yielding 6$\times$ faster end-to-end runtime for the original 3DGS algorithm and 4$\times$ for the latest efficiency-improved pipeline, achieving 24 FPS and 46 FPS respectively.

Traditional approaches often rely on Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF), primarily suited for high-contrast (full-on, full-off) flicker. To tackle varying contrast flicker, the International Committee for Display Metrology (ICDM) introduced a Temporal Contrast Sensitivity Function TCSF$_{IDMS}$ within the Information Display Measurements Standard (IDMS). Nevertheless, this standard overlooks crucial parameters: luminance, eccentricity, and area. Existing models incorporating these parameters are inadequate for flicker detection, especially at low spatial frequencies. To address these limitations, we extend the TCSF$_{IDMS}$ and combine it with a new spatial probability summation model to incorporate the effects of luminance, eccentricity, and area (elaTCSF). We train the elaTCSF on various flicker detection datasets and establish the first variable refresh rate flicker detection dataset for further verification. Additionally, we contribute to resolving a longstanding debate on whether the flicker is more visible in peripheral vision. We demonstrate how elaTCSF can be used to predict flicker due to low-persistence in VR headsets, identify flicker-free VRR operational ranges, and determine flicker sensitivity in lighting design."
2503.16801,"Text-driven Human-Object Interaction (Text-to-HOI) generation is an emerging field with applications in animation, video games, virtual reality, and robotics. A key challenge in HOI generation is maintaining interaction consistency in long sequences. Existing Text-to-Motion-based approaches, such as discrete motion tokenization, cannot be directly applied to HOI generation due to limited data in this domain and the complexity of the modality. To address the problem of interaction consistency in long sequences, we propose an autoregressive diffusion model (ARDHOI) that predicts the next continuous token. Specifically, we introduce a Contrastive Variational Autoencoder (cVAE) to learn a physically plausible space of continuous HOI tokens, thereby ensuring that generated human-object motions are realistic and natural. For generating sequences autoregressively, we develop a Mamba-based context encoder to capture and maintain consistent sequential actions. Additionally, we implement an MLP-based denoiser to generate the subsequent token conditioned on the encoded context. Our model has been evaluated on the OMOMO and BEHAVE datasets, where it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both performance and inference speed. This makes ARDHOI a robust and efficient solution for text-driven HOI tasks"
2503.16848,"Despite advances in indoor 3D scene layout generation, synthesizing scenes with dense object arrangements remains challenging. Existing methods focus on large furniture while neglecting smaller objects, resulting in unrealistically empty scenes. Those that place small objects typically do not honor arrangement specifications, resulting in largely random placement not following the text description. We present Hierarchical Scene Motifs (HSM): a hierarchical framework for indoor scene generation with dense object arrangements across spatial scales. Indoor scenes are inherently hierarchical, with surfaces supporting objects at different scales, from large furniture on floors to smaller objects on tables and shelves. HSM embraces this hierarchy and exploits recurring cross-scale spatial patterns to generate complex and realistic scenes in a unified manner. Our experiments show that HSM outperforms existing methods by generating scenes that better conform to user input across room types and spatial configurations.

2503.17059,"Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable synthesis quality and diversity in generating co-speech gestures. However, the computationally intensive sampling steps associated with diffusion models hinder their practicality in real-world applications. Hence, we present DIDiffGes, for a Decoupled Semi-Implicit Diffusion model-based framework, that can synthesize high-quality, expressive gestures from speech using only a few sampling steps. Our approach leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enable large-step sampling for diffusion model. We decouple gesture data into body and hands distributions and further decompose them into marginal and conditional distributions. GANs model the marginal distribution implicitly, while L2 reconstruction loss learns the conditional distributions exciplictly. This strategy enhances GAN training stability and ensures expressiveness of generated full-body gestures. Our framework also learns to denoise root noise conditioned on local body representation, guaranteeing stability and realism. DIDiffGes can generate gestures from speech with just 10 sampling steps, without compromising quality and expressiveness, reducing the number of sampling steps by a factor of 100 compared to existing methods. Our user study reveals that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in human likeness, appropriateness, and style correctness. Project isthis https URL."
2503.17095,"Recent 3D face editing methods using masks have produced high-quality edited images by leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Despite their impressive performance, existing methods often provide limited user control due to the use of pre-trained segmentation masks. To utilize masks with a desired layout, an extensive training dataset is required, which is challenging to gather. We present FFaceNeRF, a NeRF-based face editing technique that can overcome the challenge of limited user control due to the use of fixed mask layouts. Our method employs a geometry adapter with feature injection, allowing for effective manipulation of geometry attributes. Additionally, we adopt latent mixing for tri-plane augmentation, which enables training with a few samples. This facilitates rapid model adaptation to desired mask layouts, crucial for applications in fields like personalized medical imaging or creative face editing.

2503.19136,"Poisson Surface Reconstruction is a widely-used algorithm for reconstructing a surface from an oriented point cloud. To facilitate applications where only partial surface information is available, or scanning is performed sequentially, a recent line of work proposes to incorporate uncertainty into the reconstructed surface via Gaussian process models. The resulting algorithms first perform Gaussian process interpolation, then solve a set of volumetric partial differential equations globally in space, resulting in a computationally expensive two-stage procedure. In this work, we apply recently-developed techniques from geometric Gaussian processes to combine interpolation and surface reconstruction into a single stage, requiring only one linear solve per sample. The resulting reconstructed surface samples can be queried locally in space, without the use of problem-dependent volumetric meshes or grids. These capabilities enable one to (a) perform probabilistic collision detection locally around the region of interest, (b) perform ray casting without evaluating points not on the ray's trajectory, and (c) perform next-view planning on a per-ray basis. They also do not requiring one to approximate kernel matrix inverses with diagonal matrices as part of intermediate computations, unlike prior methods. Results show that our approach provides a cleaner, more-principled, and more-flexible stochastic surface reconstruction pipeline."
2503.19232,"Novel view synthesis has demonstrated impressive progress recently, with 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) offering efficient training time and photorealistic real-time rendering. However, reliance on Cartesian coordinates limits 3DGS's performance on distant objects, which is important for reconstructing unbounded outdoor environments. We found that, despite its ultimate simplicity, using homogeneous coordinates, a concept on the projective geometry, for the 3DGS pipeline remarkably improves the rendering accuracies of distant objects. We therefore propose Homogeneous Gaussian Splatting (HoGS) incorporating homogeneous coordinates into the 3DGS framework, providing a unified representation for enhancing near and distant objects. HoGS effectively manages both expansive spatial positions and scales particularly in outdoor unbounded environments by adopting projective geometry principles. Experiments show that HoGS significantly enhances accuracy in reconstructing distant objects while maintaining high-quality rendering of nearby objects, along with fast training speed and real-time rendering capability. Our implementations are available on our project pagethis https URL."

U2-Net is employed for background removal to isolate target objects from raw images, thereby minimizing clutter and ensuring that the model processes only relevant data. Additionally, a Sobel filter-based attention mechanism is integrated into the 3DGS framework to enhance fine details - capturing critical features such as screws, wires, and intricate textures essential for high-precision tasks. We validate our approach using quantitative metrics, including L1 loss, SSIM, PSNR, comparing the performance of the background-removed and attention-incorporated 3DGS model against the ground truth images and the original 3DGS training baseline. The results demonstrate significant improves in visual fidelity and detail preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our method in enhancing robotic vision for object recognition and manipulation in complex industrial settings."
2503.19673,"Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive performances in the rendering of 3D scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. While RGB images are widely preferred for training volume rendering models, the interest in other radiance modalities is also growing. However, the capability of the underlying implicit neural models to learn and transfer information across heterogeneous imaging modalities has seldom been explored, mostly due to the limited training data availability. For this purpose, we present MultimodalStudio (MMS): it encompasses MMS-DATA and MMS-FW. MMS-DATA is a multimodal multi-view dataset containing 32 scenes acquired with 5 different imaging modalities: RGB, monochrome, near-infrared, polarization and multispectral. MMS-FW is a novel modular multimodal NeRF framework designed to handle multimodal raw data and able to support an arbitrary number of multi-channel devices. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MMS-FW trained on MMS-DATA can transfer information between different imaging modalities and produce higher quality renderings than using single modalities alone. We publicly release the dataset and the framework, to promote the research on multimodal volume rendering and beyond."

2503.19976,"3D reconstruction of highly deformable surfaces (e.g. cloths) from monocular RGB videos is a challenging problem, and no solution provides a consistent and accurate recovery of fine-grained surface details. To account for the ill-posed nature of the setting, existing methods use deformation models with statistical, neural, or physical priors. They also predominantly rely on nonadaptive discrete surface representations (e.g. polygonal meshes), perform frame-by-frame optimisation leading to error propagation, and suffer from poor gradients of the mesh-based differentiable renderers. Consequently, fine surface details such as cloth wrinkles are often not recovered with the desired accuracy. In response to these limitations, we propose ThinShell-SfT, a new method for non-rigid 3D tracking that represents a surface as an implicit and continuous spatiotemporal neural field. We incorporate continuous thin shell physics prior based on the Kirchhoff-Love model for spatial regularisation, which starkly contrasts the discretised alternatives of earlier works. Lastly, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting to differentiably render the surface into image space and optimise the deformations based on analysis-bysynthesis principles. Our Thin-Shell-SfT outperforms prior works qualitatively and quantitatively thanks to our continuous surface formulation in conjunction with a specially tailored simulation prior and surface-induced 3D Gaussians.

2503.20118,"Human-object interaction (HOI) synthesis is important for various applications, ranging from virtual reality to robotics. However, acquiring 3D HOI data is challenging due to its complexity and high cost, limiting existing methods to the narrow diversity of object types and interaction patterns in training datasets. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot HOI synthesis framework without relying on end-to-end training on currently limited 3D HOI datasets. The core idea of our method lies in leveraging extensive HOI knowledge from pre-trained Multimodal Models. Given a text description, our system first obtains temporally consistent 2D HOI image sequences using image or video generation models, which are then uplifted to 3D HOI milestones of human and object poses. We employ pre-trained human pose estimation models to extract human poses and introduce a generalizable category-level 6-DoF estimation method to obtain the object poses from 2D HOI images. Our estimation method is adaptive to various object templates obtained from text-to-3D models or online retrieval. A physics-based tracking of the 3D HOI kinematic milestone is further applied to refine both body motions and object poses, yielding more physically plausible HOI generation results. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating open-vocabulary HOIs with physical realism and semantic diversity."
2503.20308,"Recent advancements in speech-driven 3D talking head generation have made significant progress in lip synchronization. However, existing models still struggle to capture the perceptual alignment between varying speech characteristics and corresponding lip movements. In this work, we claim that three criteria -- Temporal Synchronization, Lip Readability, and Expressiveness -- are crucial for achieving perceptually accurate lip movements. Motivated by our hypothesis that a desirable representation space exists to meet these three criteria, we introduce a speech-mesh synchronized representation that captures intricate correspondences between speech signals and 3D face meshes. We found that our learned representation exhibits desirable characteristics, and we plug it into existing models as a perceptual loss to better align lip movements to the given speech. In addition, we utilize this representation as a perceptual metric and introduce two other physically grounded lip synchronization metrics to assess how well the generated 3D talking heads align with these three criteria. Experiments show that training 3D talking head generation models with our perceptual loss significantly improve all three aspects of perceptually accurate lip synchronization.

2503.20779,"We introduce a novel approach to reconstruct simulation-ready garments with intricate appearance. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often struggle to balance the need for accurate garment reconstruction with the ability to generalize to new poses and body shapes or require large amounts of data to achieve this. In contrast, our method only requires a multi-view capture of a single static frame. We represent garments as hybrid mesh-embedded 3D Gaussian splats, where the Gaussians capture near-field shading and high-frequency details, while the mesh encodes far-field albedo and optimized reflectance parameters. We achieve novel pose generalization by exploiting the mesh from our hybrid approach, enabling physics-based simulation and surface rendering techniques, while also capturing fine details with Gaussians that accurately reconstruct garment details. Our optimized garments can be used for simulating garments on novel poses, and garment relighting. Project page:this https URL."
2503.20819,"Real-time 3D face manipulation has significant applications in virtual reality, social media and human-computer interaction. This paper introduces a novel system, which we call Mirror of Diversity (MOD), that combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for texture manipulation and 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) for facial geometry to achieve realistic face transformations that reflect various demographic characteristics, emphasizing the beauty of diversity and the universality of human features. As participants sit in front of a computer monitor with a camera positioned above, their facial characteristics are captured in real time and can further alter their digital face reconstruction with transformations reflecting different demographic characteristics, such as gender and ethnicity (e.g., a person from Africa, Asia, Europe). Another feature of our system, which we call Collective Face, generates an averaged face representation from multiple participants' facial data. A comprehensive evaluation protocol is implemented to assess the realism and demographic accuracy of the transformations. Qualitative feedback is gathered through participant questionnaires, which include comparisons of MOD transformations with similar filters on platforms like Snapchat and TikTok. Additionally, quantitative analysis is conducted using a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network that predicts gender and ethnicity, to validate the accuracy of demographic transformations."
2503.20992,"Text-driven speech style transfer aims to mold the intonation, pace, and timbre of a spoken utterance to match stylistic cues from text descriptions. While existing methods leverage large-scale neural architectures or pre-trained language models, the computational costs often remain high. In this paper, we present \emph{ReverBERT}, an efficient framework for text-driven speech style transfer that draws inspiration from a state space model (SSM) paradigm, loosely motivated by the image-based method of Wang and Liu~\cite{wang2024stylemamba}. Unlike image domain techniques, our method operates in the speech space and integrates a discrete Fourier transform of latent speech features to enable smooth and continuous style modulation. We also propose a novel \emph{Transformer-based SSM} layer for bridging textual style descriptors with acoustic attributes, dramatically reducing inference time while preserving high-quality speech characteristics. Extensive experiments on benchmark speech corpora demonstrate that \emph{ReverBERT} significantly outperforms baselines in terms of naturalness, expressiveness, and computational efficiency.

2503.20998,"We propose Covisibility Map-based Gaussian Splatting (CoMapGS), designed to recover underrepresented sparse regions in sparse novel view synthesis. CoMapGS addresses both high- and low-uncertainty regions by constructing covisibility maps, enhancing initial point clouds, and applying uncertainty-aware weighted supervision using a proximity classifier. Our contributions are threefold: (1) CoMapGS reframes novel view synthesis by leveraging covisibility maps as a core component to address region-specific uncertainty; (2) Enhanced initial point clouds for both low- and high-uncertainty regions compensate for sparse COLMAP-derived point clouds, improving reconstruction quality and benefiting few-shot 3DGS methods; (3) Adaptive supervision with covisibility-score-based weighting and proximity classification achieves consistent performance gains across scenes with varying sparsity scores derived from covisibility maps. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMapGS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and LLFF."
2503.21442,"We consider the problem of adding dynamic rain effects to in-the-wild scenes in a physically-correct manner. Recent advances in scene modeling have made significant progress, with NeRF and 3DGS techniques emerging as powerful tools for reconstructing complex scenes. However, while effective for novel view synthesis, these methods typically struggle with challenging scene editing tasks, such as physics-based rain simulation. In contrast, traditional physics-based simulations can generate realistic rain effects, such as raindrops and splashes, but they often rely on skilled artists to carefully set up high-fidelity scenes. This process lacks flexibility and scalability, limiting its applicability to broader, open-world environments. In this work, we introduce RainyGS, a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both physics-based modeling and 3DGS to generate photorealistic, dynamic rain effects in open-world scenes with physical accuracy. At the core of our method is the integration of physically-based raindrop and shallow water simulation techniques within the fast 3DGS rendering framework, enabling realistic and efficient simulations of raindrop behavior, splashes, and reflections. Our method supports synthesizing rain effects at over 30 fps, offering users flexible control over rain intensity -- from light drizzles to heavy downpours. We demonstrate that RainyGS performs effectively for both real-world outdoor scenes and large-scale driving scenarios, delivering more photorealistic and physically-accurate rain effects compared to state-of-the-art methods.

2503.21694,"It is highly desirable to obtain a model that can generate high-quality 3D meshes from text prompts in just seconds. While recent attempts have adapted pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), into generators of 3D representations (e.g., Triplane), they often suffer from poor quality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at overcoming the data shortage, we propose a novel training scheme, termed as Progressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), eliminating the need for 3D ground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a native 3D generator. In each iteration of training, PRD uses the U-Net to progressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps, and in each step it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion models, including MVDream and RichDreamer, are used in joint with SD to distill text-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score distillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths, we can easily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for challenging text prompts with creative concepts. Meanwhile, PRD can accelerate the inference speed of the generation model in just a few steps. With PRD, we train a Triplane generator, namely TriplaneTurbo, which adds only $2.5\%$ trainable parameters to adapt SD for Triplane generation. TriplaneTurbo outperforms previous text-to-3D generators in both efficiency and quality. Specifically, it can produce high-quality 3D meshes in 1.2 seconds and generalize well for challenging text input. The code is available atthis https URL."
2503.21816,"Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based methods rely on sufficient training view coverage and perform synthesis on interpolated views. In this work, we tackle the more challenging and underexplored Extrapolated View Synthesis (EVS) task. Here we enable GS-based models trained with limited view coverage to generalize well to extrapolated views. To achieve our goal, we propose a view augmentation framework to guide training through a coarse-to-fine process. At the coarse stage, we reduce rendering artifacts due to insufficient view coverage by introducing a regularization strategy at both appearance and geometry levels. At the fine stage, we generate reliable view priors to provide further training guidance. To this end, we incorporate an occlusion awareness into the view prior generation process, and refine the view priors with the aid of coarse stage output. We call our framework Enhanced View Prior Guidance for Splatting (EVPGS). To comprehensively evaluate EVPGS on the EVS task, we collect a real-world dataset called Merchandise3D dedicated to the EVS scenario. Experiments on three datasets including both real and synthetic demonstrate EVPGS achieves state-of-the-art performance, while improving synthesis quality at extrapolated views for GS-based methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. We will make our code, dataset, and models public."
2503.21847,"We present ReCoM, an efficient framework for generating high-fidelity and generalizable human body motions synchronized with speech. The core innovation lies in the Recurrent Embedded Transformer (RET), which integrates Dynamic Embedding Regularization (DER) into a Vision Transformer (ViT) core architecture to explicitly model co-speech motion dynamics. This architecture enables joint spatial-temporal dependency modeling, thereby enhancing gesture naturalness and fidelity through coherent motion synthesis. To enhance model robustness, we incorporate the proposed DER strategy, which equips the model with dual capabilities of noise resistance and cross-domain generalization, thereby improving the naturalness and fluency of zero-shot motion generation for unseen speech inputs. To mitigate inherent limitations of autoregressive inference, including error accumulation and limited self-correction, we propose an iterative reconstruction inference (IRI) strategy. IRI refines motion sequences via cyclic pose reconstruction, driven by two key components: (1) classifier-free guidance improves distribution alignment between generated and real gestures without auxiliary supervision, and (2) a temporal smoothing process eliminates abrupt inter-frame transitions while ensuring kinematic continuity. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate ReCoM's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across metrics. Notably, it reduces the Fréchet Gesture Distance (FGD) from 18.70 to 2.48, demonstrating an 86.7% improvement in motion realism. Our project page isthis https URL."
2503.21886,"High-fidelity reconstruction of head avatars from monocular videos is highly desirable for virtual human applications, but it remains a challenge in the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. In this paper, we propose a two-phase head avatar reconstruction network that incorporates a refined 3D mesh representation. Our approach, in contrast to existing methods that rely on coarse template-based 3D representations derived from 3DMM, aims to learn a refined mesh representation suitable for a NeRF that captures complex facial nuances. In the first phase, we train 3DMM-stored NeRF with an initial mesh to utilize geometric priors and integrate observations across frames using a consistent set of latent codes. In the second phase, we leverage a novel mesh refinement procedure based on an SDF constructed from the density field of the initial NeRF. To mitigate the typical noise in the NeRF density field without compromising the features of the 3DMM, we employ Laplace smoothing on the displacement field. Subsequently, we apply a second-phase training with these refined meshes, directing the learning process of the network towards capturing intricate facial details. Our experiments demonstrate that our method further enhances the NeRF rendering based on the initial mesh and achieves performance superior to state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing high-fidelity head avatars with such input."
2503.21931,"Problems in differentiable rendering often involve optimizing scene parameters that cause motion in image space. The gradients for such parameters tend to be sparse, leading to poor convergence. While existing methods address this sparsity through proxy gradients such as topological derivatives or lagrangian derivatives, they make simplifying assumptions about rendering. Multi-resolution image pyramids offer an alternative approach but prove unreliable in practice. We introduce a method that uses locally orderless images, where each pixel maps to a histogram of intensities that preserves local variations in appearance. Using an inverse rendering objective that minimizes histogram distance, our method extends support for sparsely defined image gradients and recovers optimal parameters. We validate our method on various inverse problems using both synthetic and real data."
2503.22159,"While dynamic novel view synthesis from 2D videos has seen progress, achieving efficient reconstruction and rendering of dynamic scenes remains a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce Disentangled 4D Gaussian Splatting (Disentangled4DGS), a novel representation and rendering pipeline that achieves real-time performance without compromising visual fidelity. Disentangled4DGS decouples the temporal and spatial components of 4D Gaussians, avoiding the need for slicing first and four-dimensional matrix calculations in prior methods. By projecting temporal and spatial deformations into dynamic 2D Gaussians and deferring temporal processing, we minimize redundant computations of 4DGS. Our approach also features a gradient-guided flow loss and temporal splitting strategy to reduce artifacts. Experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in rendering speed and quality, achieving 343 FPS when render 1352*1014 resolution images on a single RTX3090 while reducing storage requirements by at least 4.5%.

2503.22236,"With the growing demand for high-fidelity 3D models from 2D images, existing methods still face significant challenges in accurately reproducing fine-grained geometric details due to limitations in domain gaps and inherent ambiguities in RGB images. To address these issues, we propose Hi3DGen, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity 3D geometry from images via normal bridging. Hi3DGen consists of three key components: (1) an image-to-normal estimator that decouples the low-high frequency image pattern with noise injection and dual-stream training to achieve generalizable, stable, and sharp estimation; (2) a normal-to-geometry learning approach that uses normal-regularized latent diffusion learning to enhance 3D geometry generation fidelity; and (3) a 3D data synthesis pipeline that constructs a high-quality dataset to support training.

2503.22605,"Talking head synthesis has emerged as a prominent research topic in computer graphics and multimedia, yet most existing methods often struggle to strike a balance between generation quality and computational efficiency, particularly under real-time constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates Gaussian Splatting with a structured Audio Factorization Plane (Audio-Plane) to enable high-quality, audio-synchronized, and real-time talking head generation. For modeling a dynamic talking head, a 4D volume representation, which consists of three axes in 3D space and one temporal axis aligned with audio progression, is typically required. However, directly storing and processing a dense 4D grid is impractical due to the high memory and computation cost, and lack of scalability for longer durations. We address this challenge by decomposing the 4D volume representation into a set of audio-independent spatial planes and audio-dependent planes, forming a compact and interpretable representation for talking head modeling that we refer to as the Audio-Plane. This factorized design allows for efficient and fine-grained audio-aware spatial encoding, and significantly enhances the model's ability to capture complex lip dynamics driven by speech signals. To further improve region-specific motion modeling, we introduce an audio-guided saliency splatting mechanism based on region-aware modulation, which adaptively emphasizes highly dynamic regions such as the mouth area. This allows the model to focus its learning capacity on where it matters most for accurate speech-driven animation. Extensive experiments on both the self-driven and the cross-driven settings demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual quality, precise audio-lip synchronization, and real-time performance, outperforming prior approaches across both 2D- and 3D-based paradigms."
2503.22729,"In the realm of computer graphics, the ability to learn continuously from non-stationary data streams while adapting to new visual patterns and mitigating catastrophic forgetting is of paramount importance. Existing approaches often struggle to capture and represent the essential characteristics of evolving visual concepts, hindering their applicability to dynamic graphics tasks. In this paper, we propose Ancestral Mamba, a novel approach that integrates online prototype learning into a selective discriminant space model for efficient and robust online continual learning. The key components of our approach include Ancestral Prototype Adaptation (APA), which continuously refines and builds upon learned visual prototypes, and Mamba Feedback (MF), which provides targeted feedback to adapt to challenging visual patterns. APA enables the model to continuously adapt its prototypes, building upon ancestral knowledge to tackle new challenges, while MF acts as a targeted feedback mechanism, focusing on challenging classes and refining their representations. Extensive experiments on graphics-oriented datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, demonstrate the superior performance of Ancestral Mamba compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and forgetting mitigation."
2503.23241,"We present Geometry in Style, a new method for identity-preserving mesh stylization. Existing techniques either adhere to the original shape through overly restrictive deformations such as bump maps or significantly modify the input shape using expressive deformations that may introduce artifacts or alter the identity of the source shape. In contrast, we represent a deformation of a triangle mesh as a target normal vector for each vertex neighborhood. The deformations we recover from target normals are expressive enough to enable detailed stylizations yet restrictive enough to preserve the shape's identity. We achieve such deformations using our novel differentiable As-Rigid-As-Possible (dARAP) layer, a neural-network-ready adaptation of the classical ARAP algorithm which we use to solve for per-vertex rotations and deformed vertices. As a differentiable layer, dARAP is paired with a visual loss from a text-to-image model to drive deformations toward style prompts, altogether giving us Geometry in Style.

2503.23284,"Video generation and editing conditioned on text prompts or images have undergone significant advancements. However, challenges remain in accurately controlling global layout and geometry details solely by texts, and supporting motion control and local modification through images. In this paper, we aim to achieve sketch-based spatial and motion control for video generation and support fine-grained editing of real or synthetic videos. Based on the DiT video generation model, we propose a memory-efficient control structure with sketch control blocks that predict residual features of skipped DiT blocks. Sketches are drawn on one or two keyframes (at arbitrary time points) for easy interaction. To propagate such temporally sparse sketch conditions across all frames, we propose an inter-frame attention mechanism to analyze the relationship between the keyframes and each video frame. For sketch-based video editing, we design an additional video insertion module that maintains consistency between the newly edited content and the original video's spatial feature and dynamic motion. During inference, we use latent fusion for the accurate preservation of unedited regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SketchVideo achieves superior performance in controllable video generation and editing."
2503.2341,"Prior foveated rendering methods often suffer from a limitation where the shading load escalates with increasing display resolution, leading to decreased efficiency, particularly when dealing with retinal-level resolutions. To tackle this challenge, we begin with the essence of the human visual system (HVS) perception and present visual acuity-consistent foveated rendering (VaFR), aiming to achieve exceptional rendering performance at retinal-level resolutions. Specifically, we propose a method with a novel log-polar mapping function derived from the human visual acuity model, which accommodates the natural bandwidth of the visual system. This mapping function and its associated shading rate guarantee a consistent output of rendering information, regardless of variations in the display resolution of the VR HMD. Consequently, our VaFR outperforms alternative methods, improving rendering speed while preserving perceptual visual quality, particularly when operating at retinal resolutions. We validate our approach using both the rasterization and ray-casting rendering pipelines. We also validate our approach using different binocular rendering strategies for HMD devices. In diverse testing scenarios, our approach delivers better perceptual visual quality than prior foveated rendering while achieving an impressive speedup of 6.5$\times$-9.29$\times$ for deferred rendering of 3D scenarios and an even more powerful speedup of 10.4$\times$-16.4$\times$ for ray-casting at retinal resolution. Additionally, our approach significantly enhances the rendering performance of binocular 8K path tracing, achieving smooth frame rates."
2503.23412,"Robust light transport algorithms, particularly bidirectional path tracing (BDPT), face significant challenges when dealing with specular or highly glossy involved paths. BDPT constructs the full path by connecting sub-paths traced individually from the light source and camera. However, it remains difficult to sample by connecting vertices on specular and glossy surfaces with narrow-lobed BSDF, as it poses severe constraints on sampling in the feasible direction. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, called \emph{proxy sampling}, that enables efficient sub-path connection of these challenging paths. When a low-contribution specular/glossy connection occurs, we drop out the problematic neighboring vertex next to this specular/glossy vertex from the original path, then retrace an alternative sub-path as a proxy to complement this incomplete path. This newly constructed complete path ensures that the connection adheres to the constraint of the narrow lobe within the BSDF of the specular/glossy surface. Unbiased reciprocal estimation is the key to our method to obtain a probability density function (PDF) reciprocal to ensure unbiased rendering. We derive the reciprocal estimation method and provide an efficiency-optimized setting for efficient sampling and connection. Our method provides a robust tool for substituting problematic paths with favorable alternatives while ensuring unbiasedness. We validate this approach in the probabilistic connections BDPT for addressing specular-involved difficult paths. Experimental results have proved the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, showcasing high-performance rendering capabilities across diverse settings."
2503.23441,"Lens visualization has been a prominent research area in the visualization community, fueled by the continuous need to mitigate visual clutter and occlusion resulting from the increase in data volume. Interactive lenses for spatial data, particularly, challenge designers to conceive design strategies to support the analysis of high-density, multifaceted data with spatial referents. Despite their relevance, there is a lack of systematic understanding regarding the various design elements that compose spatially-embedded lens visualizations. To fill in this gap, we unify these components under a common hood in the form of a design space, which we propose in this paper. Building our knowledge on top of the initial insights gained from Tominski et al.'s survey [57], we construct a design space spanning 7 dimensions through our analysis of 45 papers published in the visualization community over the past 15 years. We describe each design dimension through representative examples and examine the range of design choices available within each, discussing their benefits and pitfalls that affect lens performance and usability. In doing so, we offer a cohesive catalog of considerations for designers-both when examining existing lenses and when conceptualizing novel spatially-embedded lens visualizations. We conclude by shedding light on regions of the design space that remain largely understudied, revealing open opportunities for future research."
2503.23625,"The rapidly advancing field of Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) demands real-time, photorealistic rendering on resource-constrained platforms. 3D Gaussian Splatting, delivering state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in rendering efficiency and quality, has emerged as a promising solution across a broad spectrum of AR/VR applications. However, despite its effectiveness on high-end GPUs, it struggles on edge systems like the Jetson Orin NX Edge GPU, achieving only 7-17 FPS -- well below the over 60 FPS standard required for truly immersive AR/VR experiences. Addressing this challenge, we perform a comprehensive analysis of Gaussian-based AR/VR applications and identify the Gaussian Blending Stage, which intensively calculates each Gaussian's contribution at every pixel, as the primary bottleneck. In response, we propose a Gaussian Blending Unit (GBU), an edge GPU plug-in module for real-time rendering in AR/VR applications. Notably, our GBU can be seamlessly integrated into conventional edge GPUs and collaboratively supports a wide range of AR/VR applications. Specifically, GBU incorporates an intra-row sequential shading (IRSS) dataflow that shades each row of pixels sequentially from left to right, utilizing a two-step coordinate transformation. When directly deployed on a GPU, the proposed dataflow achieved a non-trivial 1.72x speedup on real-world static scenes, though still falls short of real-time rendering performance. Recognizing the limited compute utilization in the GPU-based implementation, GBU enhances rendering speed with a dedicated rendering engine that balances the workload across rows by aggregating computations from multiple Gaussians. Experiments across representative AR/VR applications demonstrate that our GBU provides a unified solution for on-device real-time rendering while maintaining SOTA rendering quality."
2503.23644,"Recent advancements in neural rendering technologies and their supporting devices have paved the way for immersive 3D experiences, significantly transforming human interaction with intelligent devices across diverse applications. However, achieving the desired real-time rendering speeds for immersive interactions is still hindered by (1) the lack of a universal algorithmic solution for different application scenarios and (2) the dedication of existing devices or accelerators to merely specific rendering pipelines. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a unified neural rendering accelerator that caters to a wide array of typical neural rendering pipelines, enabling real-time and on-device rendering across different applications while maintaining both efficiency and compatibility. Our accelerator design is based on the insight that, although neural rendering pipelines vary and their algorithm designs are continually evolving, they typically share common operators, predominantly executing similar workloads. Building on this insight, we propose a reconfigurable hardware architecture that can dynamically adjust dataflow to align with specific rendering metric requirements for diverse applications, effectively supporting both typical and the latest hybrid rendering pipelines. Benchmarking experiments and ablation studies on both synthetic and real-world scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed accelerator. The proposed unified accelerator stands out as the first solution capable of achieving real-time neural rendering across varied representative pipelines on edge devices, potentially paving the way for the next generation of neural graphics applications."
2503.23707,"3D layout tasks have traditionally concentrated on geometric constraints, but many practical applications demand richer contextual understanding that spans social interactions, cultural traditions, and usage conventions. Existing methods often rely on rule-based heuristics or narrowly trained learning models, making them difficult to generalize and frequently prone to orientation errors that break realism. To address these challenges, we define four escalating context levels, ranging from straightforward physical placement to complex cultural requirements such as religious customs and advanced social norms. We then propose a Vision-Language Model-based pipeline that inserts minimal visual cues for orientation guidance and employs iterative feedback to pinpoint, diagnose, and correct unnatural placements in an automated fashion. Each adjustment is revisited through the system's verification process until it achieves a coherent result, thereby eliminating the need for extensive user oversight or manual parameter tuning. Our experiments across these four context levels reveal marked improvements in rotation accuracy, distance control, and overall layout plausibility compared with native VLM. By reducing the dependence on pre-programmed constraints or prohibitively large training sets, our method enables fully automated scene composition for both everyday scenarios and specialized cultural tasks, moving toward a universally adaptable framework for 3D arrangement."
2503.23752,"In the field of sketch generation, raster-format trained models often produce non-stroke artifacts, while vector-format trained models typically lack a holistic understanding of sketches, leading to compromised recognizability. Moreover, existing methods struggle to extract common features from similar elements (e.g., eyes of animals) appearing at varying positions across sketches. To address these challenges, we propose StrokeFusion, a two-stage framework for vector sketch generation. It contains a dual-modal sketch feature learning network that maps strokes into a high-quality latent space. This network decomposes sketches into normalized strokes and jointly encodes stroke sequences with Unsigned Distance Function (UDF) maps, representing sketches as sets of stroke feature vectors. Building upon this representation, our framework exploits a stroke-level latent diffusion model that simultaneously adjusts stroke position, scale, and trajectory during generation. This enables high-fidelity sketch generation while supporting stroke interpolation editing. Extensive experiments on the QuickDraw dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, validating its effectiveness in preserving structural integrity and semantic features. Code and models will be made publicly available upon publication."
2503.24009,"Realistic simulation is critical for applications ranging from robotics to animation. Learned simulators have emerged as a possibility to capture real world physics directly from video data, but very often require privileged information such as depth information, particle tracks and hand-engineered features to maintain spatial and temporal consistency. These strong inductive biases or ground truth 3D information help in domains where data is sparse but limit scalability and generalization in data rich regimes. To overcome the key limitations, we propose 3DGSim, a learned 3D simulator that directly learns physical interactions from multi-view RGB videos. 3DGSim unifies 3D scene reconstruction, particle dynamics prediction and video synthesis into an end-to-end trained framework. It adopts MVSplat to learn a latent particle-based representation of 3D scenes, a Point Transformer for particle dynamics, a Temporal Merging module for consistent temporal aggregation and Gaussian Splatting to produce novel view renderings. By jointly training inverse rendering and dynamics forecasting, 3DGSim embeds the physical properties into point-wise latent features. This enables the model to capture diverse physical behaviors, from rigid to elastic, cloth-like dynamics, and boundary conditions (e.g. fixed cloth corner), along with realistic lighting effects that also generalize to unseen multibody interactions and novel scene edits."
2504.00234,"Reproducing realistic collective behaviors presents a captivating yet formidable challenge. Traditional rule-based methods rely on hand-crafted principles, limiting motion diversity and realism in generated collective behaviors. Recent imitation learning methods learn from data but often require ground truth motion trajectories and struggle with authenticity, especially in high-density groups with erratic movements. In this paper, we present a scalable approach, Collective Behavior Imitation Learning (CBIL), for learning fish schooling behavior directly from videos, without relying on captured motion trajectories. Our method first leverages Video Representation Learning, where a Masked Video AutoEncoder (MVAE) extracts implicit states from video inputs in a self-supervised manner. The MVAE effectively maps 2D observations to implicit states that are compact and expressive for following the imitation learning stage. Then, we propose a novel adversarial imitation learning method to effectively capture complex movements of the schools of fish, allowing for efficient imitation of the distribution for motion patterns measured in the latent space. It also incorporates bio-inspired rewards alongside priors to regularize and stabilize training. Once trained, CBIL can be used for various animation tasks with the learned collective motion priors. We further show its effectiveness across different species. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our system in detecting abnormal fish behavior from in-the-wild videos."
2504.00745,"The simulation of sand--water mixtures requires capturing the stochastic behavior of individual sand particles within a uniform, continuous fluid medium, such as the characteristic of migration, deposition, and plugging across various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a Granule-in-Cell (GIC) method for simulating such sand--water interaction. We leverage the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to capture the fine-scale details of individual granules and the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method for its continuous spatial representation and particle-based structure for density projection. To combine these two frameworks, we treat granules as macroscopic transport flow rather than solid boundaries for the fluid. This bidirectional coupling allows our model to accommodate a range of interphase forces with different discretization schemes, resulting in a more realistic simulation with fully respect to the mass conservation equation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in simulating complex sand--water interactions, while maintaining volume consistency. Notably, in the dam-breaking experiment, our simulation uniquely captures the distinct physical properties of sand under varying infiltration degree within a single scenario. Our work advances the state of the art in granule--fluid simulation, offering a unified framework that bridges mesoscopic and macroscopic dynamics."
2504.00904,"With the growing computational power available for high-resolution ensemble simulations in scientific fields such as cosmology and oceanology, storage and computational demands present significant challenges. Current surrogate models fall short in the flexibility of point- or region-based predictions as the entire field reconstruction is required for each parameter setting, hence hindering the efficiency of parameter space exploration. Limitations exist in capturing physical attribute distributions and pinpointing optimal parameter configurations. In this work, we propose Explorable INR, a novel implicit neural representation-based surrogate model, designed to facilitate exploration and allow point-based spatial queries without computing full-scale field data. In addition, to further address computational bottlenecks of spatial exploration, we utilize probabilistic affine forms (PAFs) for uncertainty propagation through Explorable INR to obtain statistical summaries, facilitating various ensemble analysis and visualization tasks that are expensive with existing models. Furthermore, we reformulate the parameter exploration problem as optimization tasks using gradient descent and KL divergence minimization that ensures scalability. We demonstrate that the Explorable INR with the proposed approach for spatial and parameter exploration can significantly reduce computation and memory costs while providing effective ensemble analysis."

We propose GeometryCrafter, a novel framework that recovers high-fidelity point map sequences with temporal coherence from open-world videos, enabling accurate 3D/4D reconstruction, camera parameter estimation, and other depth-based applications. At the core of our approach lies a point map Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that learns a latent space agnostic to video latent distributions for effective point map encoding and decoding. Leveraging the VAE, we train a video diffusion model to model the distribution of point map sequences conditioned on the input videos. Extensive evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate that GeometryCrafter achieves state-of-the-art 3D accuracy, temporal consistency, and generalization capability."
2504.01027,"Implicit neural representations (INRs) have been successfully used to compress a variety of 3D surface representations such as Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), voxel grids, and also other forms of structured data such as images, videos, and audio. However, these methods have been limited in their application to unstructured data such as 3D meshes and point clouds. This work presents a simple yet effective method that extends the usage of INRs to compress 3D triangle meshes. Our method encodes a displacement field that refines the coarse version of the 3D mesh surface to be compressed using a small neural network. Once trained, the neural network weights occupy much lower memory than the displacement field or the original surface. We show that our method is capable of preserving intricate geometric textures and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for compression ratios ranging from 4x to 380x."
2504.01204,"We present Articulated Kinematics Distillation (AKD), a framework for generating high-fidelity character animations by merging the strengths of skeleton-based animation and modern generative models. AKD uses a skeleton-based representation for rigged 3D assets, drastically reducing the Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) by focusing on joint-level control, which allows for efficient, consistent motion synthesis. Through Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with pre-trained video diffusion models, AKD distills complex, articulated motions while maintaining structural integrity, overcoming challenges faced by 4D neural deformation fields in preserving shape consistency. This approach is naturally compatible with physics-based simulation, ensuring physically plausible interactions.

2504.01358,"3D Gaussian Splatting shows great potential in reconstructing photo-realistic 3D scenes. However, these methods typically bake illumination into their representations, limiting their use for physically-based rendering and scene editing. Although recent inverse rendering approaches aim to decompose scenes into material and lighting components, they often rely on simplifying assumptions that fail when editing. We present a novel approach that enables efficient global illumination for 3D Gaussians Splatting through screen-space ray tracing. Our key insight is that a substantial amount of indirect light can be traced back to surfaces visible within the current view frustum. Leveraging this observation, we augment the direct shading computed by 3D Gaussians with Monte-Carlo screen-space ray-tracing to capture one-bounce indirect illumination. In this way, our method enables realistic global illumination without sacrificing the computational efficiency and editability benefits of 3D Gaussians. Through experiments, we show that the screen-space approximation we utilize allows for indirect illumination and supports real-time rendering and editing.

2504.01571,"We present Pro-DG, a framework for procedurally controllable photo-realistic facade generation that combines a procedural shape grammar with diffusion-based image synthesis. Starting from a single input image, we reconstruct its facade layout using grammar rules, then edit that structure through user-defined transformations. As facades are inherently multi-hierarchical structures, we introduce hierarchical matching procedure that aligns facade structures at different levels which is used to introduce control maps to guide a generative diffusion pipeline. This approach retains local appearance fidelity while accommodating large-scale edits such as floor duplication or window rearrangement. We provide a thorough evaluation, comparing Pro-DG against inpainting-based baselines and synthetic ground truths. Our user study and quantitative measurements indicate improved preservation of architectural identity and higher edit accuracy. Our novel method is the first to integrate neuro-symbolically derived shape-grammars for modeling with modern generative model and highlights the broader potential of such approaches for precise and controllable image manipulation."
2504.01786,"3D graphics editing is crucial in applications like movie production and game design, yet it remains a time-consuming process that demands highly specialized domain expertise. Automating this process is challenging because graphical editing requires performing a variety of tasks, each requiring distinct skill sets. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for automating the editing process, but their development and evaluation are bottlenecked by the lack of a comprehensive benchmark that requires human-level perception and presents real-world editing complexity. In this work, we present BlenderGym, the first comprehensive VLM system benchmark for 3D graphics editing. BlenderGym evaluates VLM systems through code-based 3D reconstruction tasks. We evaluate closed- and open-source VLM systems and observe that even the state-of-the-art VLM system struggles with tasks relatively easy for human Blender users. Enabled by BlenderGym, we study how inference scaling techniques impact VLM's performance on graphics editing tasks. Notably, our findings reveal that the verifier used to guide the scaling of generation can itself be improved through inference scaling, complementing recent insights on inference scaling of LLM generation in coding and math tasks. We further show that inference compute is not uniformly effective and can be optimized by strategically distributing it between generation and verification."
2504.01913,"Accurately reconstructing continuous flow fields from sparse or indirect measurements remains an open challenge, as existing techniques often suffer from oversmoothing artifacts, reliance on heterogeneous architectures, and the computational burden of enforcing physics-informed losses in implicit neural representations (INRs). In this paper, we introduce a novel flow field reconstruction framework based on divergence-free kernels (DFKs), which inherently enforce incompressibility while capturing fine structures without relying on hierarchical or heterogeneous representations. Through qualitative analysis and quantitative ablation studies, we identify the matrix-valued radial basis functions derived from Wendland's $\mathcal{C}^4$ polynomial (DFKs-Wen4) as the optimal form of analytically divergence-free approximation for velocity fields, owing to their favorable numerical properties, including compact support, positive definiteness, and second-order differentiablility. Experiments across various reconstruction tasks, spanning data compression, inpainting, super-resolution, and time-continuous flow inference, has demonstrated that DFKs-Wen4 outperform INRs and other divergence-free representations in both reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency while requiring the fewest trainable parameters."
2504.01924,"Over the past two decades, researchers have made significant steps in simulating agent-based human crowds, yet most efforts remain focused on low-level tasks such as collision avoidance, path following, and flocking. Realistic simulations, however, require modeling high-level behaviors that emerge from agents interacting with each other and with their environment over time. We introduce Generative Crowds (Gen-C), a generative framework that produces crowd scenarios capturing agent-agent and agent-environment interactions, shaping coherent high-level crowd plans. To avoid the labor-intensive process of collecting and annotating real crowd video data, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to bootstrap synthetic datasets of crowd scenarios. We propose a time-expanded graph representation, encoding actions, interactions, and spatial context. Gen-C employs a dual Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) architecture that jointly learns connectivity patterns and node features conditioned on textual and structural signals, overcoming the limitations of direct LLM generation to enable scalable, environment-aware multi-agent crowd simulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Gen-C on scenarios with diverse behaviors such as a University Campus and a Train Station, showing that it generates heterogeneous crowds, coherent interactions, and high-level decision-making patterns consistent with real-world crowd dynamics."
2504.02004,"In this paper, we investigate the generation of new video backgrounds given a human foreground video, a camera pose, and a reference scene image. This task presents three key challenges. First, the generated background should precisely follow the camera movements corresponding to the human foreground. Second, as the camera shifts in different directions, newly revealed content should appear seamless and natural. Third, objects within the video frame should maintain consistent textures as the camera moves to ensure visual coherence. To address these challenges, we propose DynaScene, a new framework that uses camera poses extracted from the original video as an explicit control to drive background motion. Specifically, we design a multi-task learning paradigm that incorporates auxiliary tasks, namely background outpainting and scene variation, to enhance the realism of the generated backgrounds. Given the scarcity of suitable data, we constructed a large-scale, high-quality dataset tailored for this task, comprising video foregrounds, reference scene images, and corresponding camera poses. This dataset contains 200K video clips, ten times larger than existing real-world human video datasets, providing a significantly richer and more diverse training resource.

2504.02045,"Generating 3D scenes is still a challenging task due to the lack of readily available scene data. Most existing methods only produce partial scenes and provide limited navigational freedom. We introduce a practical and scalable solution that uses 360° video as an intermediate scene representation, capturing the full-scene context and ensuring consistent visual content throughout the generation. We propose WorldPrompter, a generative pipeline that synthesizes traversable 3D scenes from text prompts. WorldPrompter incorporates a conditional 360° panoramic video generator, capable of producing a 128-frame video that simulates a person walking through and capturing a virtual environment. The resulting video is then reconstructed as Gaussian splats by a fast feedforward 3D reconstructor, enabling a true walkable experience within the 3D scene. Experiments demonstrate that our panoramic video generation model, trained with a mix of image and video data, achieves convincing spatial and temporal consistency for static scenes. This is validated by an average COLMAP matching rate of 94.6\%, allowing for high-quality panoramic Gaussian splat reconstruction and improved navigation throughout the scene.

In this work, we build on insights from 3D Anamorphic Art to perform 3D object arrangement. We introduce RASP, a differentiable-rendering-based framework to arrange arbitrarily shaped 3D objects within a bounded volume via shadow (or silhouette)-guided optimization with an aim of minimal inter-object spacing and near-maximal occupancy.

2504.02879,"The rapid progression of generative AI (GenAI) technologies has heightened concerns regarding the misuse of AI-generated imagery. To address this issue, robust detection methods have emerged as particularly compelling, especially in challenging conditions where the targeted GenAI models are out-of-distribution or the generated images have been subjected to perturbations during transmission. This paper introduces a multi-feature fusion framework designed to enhance spatial forensic feature representations with incorporating three complementary components, namely noise correlation analysis, image gradient information, and pretrained vision encoder knowledge, using a cross-source attention mechanism. Furthermore, to identify spectral abnormality in synthetic images, we propose a frequency-aware architecture that employs the Frequency-Adaptive Dilated Convolution, enabling the joint modeling of spatial and spectral features while maintaining low computational complexity. Our framework exhibits exceptional generalization performance across fourteen diverse GenAI systems, including text-to-image diffusion models, autoregressive approaches, and post-processed deepfake methods. Notably, it achieves significantly higher mean accuracy in cross-model detection tasks when compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, the proposed method demonstrates resilience against various types of real-world image noise perturbations such as compression and blurring.

2504.03099,"Artist-drawn sketches only loosely conform to analytical models of perspective projection; the deviation of human-drawn perspective from analytical perspective models is persistent and well documented, but has yet to be algorithmically replicated. We encode this deviation between human and analytic perspectives as a continuous function in 3D space and develop a method to learn it. We seek deviation functions that (i)mimic artist deviation on our training data; (ii)generalize to other shapes; (iii)are consistent across different views of the same shape; and (iv)produce outputs that appear human-drawn. The natural data for learning this deviation is pairs of artist sketches of 3D shapes and best-matching analytical camera views of the same shapes. However, a core challenge in learning perspective deviation is the heterogeneity of human drawing choices, combined with relative data paucity (the datasets we rely on have only a few dozen training pairs). We sidestep this challenge by learning perspective deviation from an individual pair of an artist sketch of a 3D shape and the contours of the same shape rendered from a best-matching analytical camera view. We first match contours of the depicted shape to artist strokes, then learn a spatially continuous local perspective deviation function that modifies the camera perspective projecting the contours to their corresponding strokes. This function retains key geometric properties that artists strive to preserve when depicting 3D content, thus satisfying (i) and (iv) above. We generalize our method to alternative shapes and views (ii, iii) via a self-augmentation approach that algorithmically generates training data for nearby views, and enforces spatial smoothness and consistency across all views. We compare our results to potential alternatives, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach."
2504.03415,"Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a cutting-edge neural network-based technique for novel view synthesis in 3D reconstruction. However, its significant computational demands pose challenges for deployment on mobile devices. While mesh-based NeRF solutions have shown potential in achieving real-time rendering on mobile platforms, they often fail to deliver high-quality reconstructions when rendering practical complex scenes. Additionally, the non-negligible memory overhead caused by pre-computed intermediate results complicates their practical application. To overcome these challenges, we present NeRFlex, a resource-aware, high-resolution, real-time rendering framework for complex scenes on mobile devices. NeRFlex integrates mobile NeRF rendering with multi-NeRF representations that decompose a scene into multiple sub-scenes, each represented by an individual NeRF network. Crucially, NeRFlex considers both memory and computation constraints as first-class citizens and redesigns the reconstruction process accordingly. NeRFlex first designs a detail-oriented segmentation module to identify sub-scenes with high-frequency details. For each NeRF network, a lightweight profiler, built on domain knowledge, is used to accurately map configurations to visual quality and memory usage. Based on these insights and the resource constraints on mobile devices, NeRFlex presents a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently determine configurations for all NeRF representations, despite the NP-hardness of the original decision problem. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets and mobile devices demonstrate that NeRFlex achieves real-time, high-quality rendering on commercial mobile devices."

The circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) gives rise to high-dimensional toroidal manifolds that are of immense interest to mission designers. We present a meshing technique which leverages an embedding-agnostic parameterization to enable topologically accurate modelling and intuitive visualization of toroidal manifolds in arbitrarily high-dimensional embedding spaces. This work describes the extension of a discrete one-form-based toroidal point cloud meshing method to high-dimensional point clouds sampled along quasi-periodic orbital trajectories in the CR3BP. The resulting meshes are enhanced through the application of an embedding-agnostic triangle-sidedness assignment algorithm. This significantly increases the intuitiveness of interpreting the meshes after they are downprojected to 3D for visualization. These models provide novel surface-based representations of high-dimensional topologies which have so far only been shown as points or curves. This success demonstrates the effectiveness of differential geometric methods for characterizing manifolds with complex, high-dimensional embedding spaces, laying the foundation for new models and visualizations of high-dimensional solution spaces for dynamical systems. Such representations promise to enhance the utility of the three-body problem for the visual inspection and design of space mission trajectories by enabling the application of proven computational surface visualization and analysis methods to underlying solution manifolds."
2504.0398,"We present a novel lens technique to support the identification of heterogeneous features in direct volume rendering (DVR) visualizations. In contrast to data-centric transfer function (TF) design, our image-driven approach enables users to specify target features directly within the visualization using deformable quadric surfaces. The lens leverages quadrics for their expressive yet simple parametrization, enabling users to sculpt feature approximations by composing multiple quadric lenses. By doing so, the lens offers greater versatility than traditional rigid-shape lenses for selecting and bringing into focus features with irregular geometry. We discuss the lens visualization and interaction design, advocating for bimanual spatial virtual reality (VR) input for reducing cognitive and physical strain. We also report findings from a pilot qualitative evaluation with a domain specialist using a public asteroid impact dataset. These insights not only shed light on the benefits and pitfalls of using deformable lenses but also suggest directions for future research."
2504.04,"Parametric CAD models, represented as Boundary Representations (B-reps), are foundational to modern design and manufacturing workflows, offering the precision and topological breakdown required for downstream tasks such as analysis, editing, and fabrication. However, B-Reps are often inaccessible due to conversion to more standardized, less expressive geometry formats. Existing methods to recover B-Reps from measured data require complete, noise-free 3D data, which are laborious to obtain. We alleviate this difficulty by enabling the precise reconstruction of CAD shapes from a single RGB-D image. We propose a method that addresses the challenge of reconstructing only the observed geometry from a single view. To allow for these partial observations, and to avoid hallucinating incorrect geometry, we introduce a novel view-centric B-rep (VB-Rep) representation, which incorporates structures to handle visibility limits and encode geometric uncertainty. We combine panoptic image segmentation with iterative geometric optimization to refine and improve the reconstruction process. Our results demonstrate high-quality reconstruction on synthetic and real RGB-D data, showing that our method can bridge the reality gap."
2504.04153,"The advancement of 4D (i.e., sequential 3D) generation opens up new possibilities for lifelike experiences in various applications, where users can explore dynamic objects or characters from any viewpoint. Meanwhile, video generative models are receiving particular attention given their ability to produce realistic and imaginative frames. These models are also observed to exhibit strong 3D consistency, indicating the potential to act as world simulators. In this work, we present Video4DGen, a novel framework that excels in generating 4D representations from single or multiple generated videos as well as generating 4D-guided videos. This framework is pivotal for creating high-fidelity virtual contents that maintain both spatial and temporal coherence. The 4D outputs generated by Video4DGen are represented using our proposed Dynamic Gaussian Surfels (DGS), which optimizes time-varying warping functions to transform Gaussian surfels (surface elements) from a static state to a dynamically warped state. We design warped-state geometric regularization and refinements on Gaussian surfels, to preserve the structural integrity and fine-grained appearance details. To perform 4D generation from multiple videos and capture representation across spatial, temporal, and pose dimensions, we design multi-video alignment, root pose optimization, and pose-guided frame sampling strategies. The leveraging of continuous warping fields also enables a precise depiction of pose, motion, and deformation over per-video frames. Further, to improve the overall fidelity from the observation of all camera poses, Video4DGen performs novel-view video generation guided by the 4D content, with the proposed confidence-filtered DGS to enhance the quality of generated sequences. With the ability of 4D and video generation, Video4DGen offers a powerful tool for applications in virtual reality, animation, and beyond."
2504.04298,"Generative art merges creativity with computation, using algorithms to produce aesthetic works. This paper introduces Samila, a Python-based generative art library that employs mathematical functions and randomness to create visually compelling compositions. The system allows users to control the generation process through random seeds, function selections, and projection modes, enabling the exploration of randomness and artistic expression. By adjusting these parameters, artists can create diverse compositions that reflect intentionality and unpredictability. We demonstrate that Samila's outputs are uniquely determined by two random generation seeds, making regeneration nearly impossible without both. Additionally, altering the point generation functions while preserving the seed produces artworks with distinct graphical characteristics, forming a visual family. Samila serves as both a creative tool for artists and an educational resource for teaching mathematical and programming concepts. It also provides a platform for research in generative design and computational aesthetics. Future developments could include AI-driven generation and aesthetic evaluation metrics to enhance creative control and accessibility."
2504.04315,"Previous path guiding techniques typically rely on spatial subdivision structures to approximate directional target distributions, which may cause failure to capture spatio-directional correlations and introduce parallax issue. In this paper, we present Neural Parametric Mixtures (NPM), a neural formulation to encode target distributions for path guiding algorithms.We propose to use a continuous and compact neural implicit representation for encoding parametric models while decoding them via lightweight neural networks.We then derive a gradient-based optimization strategy to directly train the parameters of NPM with noisy Monte Carlo radiance estimates.Our approach efficiently models the target distribution (incident radiance or the product integrand) for path guiding, and outperforms previous guiding methods by capturing the spatio-directional correlations more accurately.Moreover, our approach is more training efficient and is practical for parallelization on modern GPUs."
2504.04411,"Identifying an appropriate radius for unbiased kernel estimation is crucial for the efficiency of radiance estimation. However, determining both the radius and unbiasedness still faces big challenges. In this paper, we first propose a statistical model of photon samples and associated contributions for progressive kernel estimation, under which the kernel estimation is unbiased if the null hypothesis of this statistical model stands. Then, we present a method to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis about the statistical population (i.e., photon samples) by the F-test in the Analysis of Variance. Hereby, we implement a progressive photon mapping (PPM) algorithm, wherein the kernel radius is determined by this hypothesis test for unbiased radiance estimation. Secondly, we propose VCM+, a reinforcement of Vertex Connection and Merging (VCM), and derive its theoretically unbiased formulation. VCM+ combines hypothesis testing-based PPM with bidirectional path tracing (BDPT) via multiple importance sampling (MIS), wherein our kernel radius can leverage the contributions from PPM and BDPT. We test our new algorithms, improved PPM and VCM+, on diverse scenarios with different lighting settings. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can alleviate light leaks and visual blur artifacts of prior radiance estimate algorithms. We also evaluate the asymptotic performance of our approach and observe an overall improvement over the baseline in all testing scenarios."
2504.04564,"We propose a compression-based approach to GPU rendering of large volumetric data using OpenVDB and NanoVDB. We use OpenVDB to create a lossy, fixed-rate compressed representation of the volume on the host, and use NanoVDB to perform fast, low-overhead, and on-the-fly decompression during rendering. We show that this approach is fast, works well even in a (incoherent) Monte Carlo path tracing context, can significantly reduce the memory requirements of volume rendering, and can be used as an almost drop-in replacement into existing 3D texture-based renderers."
2504.04634,"Recent advances in dance generation have enabled automatic synthesis of 3D dance motions. However, existing methods still struggle to produce high-fidelity dance sequences that simultaneously deliver exceptional realism, precise dance-music synchronization, high motion diversity, and physical plausibility. Moreover, existing methods lack the flexibility to edit dance sequences according to diverse guidance signals, such as musical prompts, pose constraints, action labels, and genre descriptions, significantly restricting their creative utility and adaptability. Unlike the existing approaches, DanceMosaic enables fast and high-fidelity dance generation, while allowing multimodal motion editing. Specifically, we propose a multimodal masked motion model that fuses the text-to-motion model with music and pose adapters to learn probabilistic mapping from diverse guidance signals to high-quality dance motion sequences via progressive generative masking training. To further enhance the motion generation quality, we propose multimodal classifier-free guidance and inference-time optimization mechanism that further enforce the alignment between the generated motions and the multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance in dance generation, significantly advancing the quality and editability achieved by existing approaches."
2504.04831,"Animation retargetting applies sparse motion description (e.g., keypoint sequences) to a character mesh to produce a semantically plausible and temporally coherent full-body mesh sequence. Existing approaches come with restrictions -- they require access to template-based shape priors or artist-designed deformation rigs, suffer from limited generalization to unseen motion and/or shapes, or exhibit motion jitter. We propose Self-supervised Motion Fields (SMF), a self-supervised framework that is trained with only sparse motion representations, without requiring dataset-specific annotations, templates, or rigs. At the heart of our method are Kinetic Codes, a novel autoencoder-based sparse motion encoding, that exposes a semantically rich latent space, simplifying large-scale training. Our architecture comprises dedicated spatial and temporal gradient predictors, which are jointly trained in an end-to-end fashion. The combined network, regularized by the Kinetic Codes' latent space, has good generalization across both unseen shapes and new motions. We evaluated our method on unseen motion sampled from AMASS, D4D, Mixamo, and raw monocular video for animation transfer on various characters with varying shapes and topology. We report a new SoTA on the AMASS dataset in the context of generalization to unseen motion. Code, weights, and supplementary are available on the project webpage atthis https URL"
2504.04857,"The complexity and scale of Volumetric and Simulation datasets for Scientific Visualization(SciVis) continue to grow. And the approaches and advantages of memory-efficient data formats and storage techniques for such datasets vary. OpenVDB library and its VDB data format excels in memory efficiency through its hierarchical and dynamic tree structure, with active and inactive sub-trees for data storage. It is heavily used in current production renderers for both animation and rendering stages in VFX pipelines and photorealistic rendering of volumes and fluids. However, it still remains to be fully leveraged in SciVis where domains dealing with sparse scalar fields like porous media, time varying volumes such as tornado and weather simulation or high resolution simulation of Computational Fluid Dynamics present ample number of large challenging data sets. The goal of this paper hence is not only to explore the use of OpenVDB in SciVis but also to explore a level of detail(LOD) technique using 3D Gaussian particles approximating voxel regions. For rendering, we utilize NVIDIA OptiX library for ray marching through the Gaussians particles. Data modeling using 3D Gaussians has been very popular lately due to success in stereoscopic image to 3D scene conversion using Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian approximation and mixture models aren't entirely new in SciVis as well. Our work explores the integration with rendering software libraries like OpenVDB and OptiX to take advantage of their built-in memory compaction and hardware acceleration features, while also leveraging the performance capabilities of modern GPUs. Thus, we present a SciVis rendering approach that uses 3D Gaussians at varying LOD in a lossy scheme derived from VDB datasets, rather than focusing on photorealistic volume rendering."
2504.04956,"We present REWIND (Real-Time Egocentric Whole-Body Motion Diffusion), a one-step diffusion model for real-time, high-fidelity human motion estimation from egocentric image inputs. While an existing method for egocentric whole-body (i.e., body and hands) motion estimation is non-real-time and acausal due to diffusion-based iterative motion refinement to capture correlations between body and hand poses, REWIND operates in a fully causal and real-time manner. To enable real-time inference, we introduce (1) cascaded body-hand denoising diffusion, which effectively models the correlation between egocentric body and hand motions in a fast, feed-forward manner, and (2) diffusion distillation, which enables high-quality motion estimation with a single denoising step. Our denoising diffusion model is based on a modified Transformer architecture, designed to causally model output motions while enhancing generalizability to unseen motion lengths. Additionally, REWIND optionally supports identity-conditioned motion estimation when identity prior is available. To this end, we propose a novel identity conditioning method based on a small set of pose exemplars of the target identity, which further enhances motion estimation quality. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that REWIND significantly outperforms the existing baselines both with and without exemplar-based identity conditioning."
2504.05296,"3D Gaussian Splatting has recently enabled fast and photorealistic reconstruction of static 3D scenes. However, introducing dynamic elements that interact naturally with such static scenes remains challenging. Accordingly, we present a novel hybrid framework that combines Gaussian-particle representations for incorporating physically-based global weather effects into static 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes, correctly handling the interactions of dynamic elements with the static scene. We follow a three-stage process: we first map static 3D Gaussians to a particle-based representation. We then introduce dynamic particles and simulate their motion using the Material Point Method (MPM). Finally, we map the simulated particles back to the Gaussian domain while introducing appearance parameters tailored for specific effects. To correctly handle the interactions of dynamic elements with the static scene, we introduce specialized collision handling techniques. Our approach supports a variety of weather effects, including snowfall, rainfall, fog, and sandstorms, and can also support falling objects, all with physically plausible motion and appearance. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and physical realism."
2504.05482,"Current methods for generating 3D scene layouts from text predominantly follow a declarative paradigm, where a Large Language Model (LLM) specifies high-level constraints that are then resolved by a separate solver. This paper challenges that consensus by introducing a more direct, imperative approach. We task an LLM with generating a step-by-step program that iteratively places each object relative to those already in the scene. This paradigm simplifies the underlying scene specification language, enabling the creation of more complex, varied, and highly structured layouts that are difficult to express declaratively. To improve the robustness, we complement our method with a novel, LLM-free error correction mechanism that operates directly on the generated code, iteratively adjusting parameters within the program to resolve collisions and other inconsistencies. In forced-choice perceptual studies, human participants overwhelmingly preferred our imperative layouts, choosing them over those from two state-of-the-art declarative systems 82% and 94% of the time, demonstrating the significant potential of this alternative paradigm. Finally, we present a simple automated evaluation metric for 3D scene layout generation that correlates strongly with human judgment."
2504.05517,"Traditional 3D content representations include dense point clouds that consume large amounts of data and hence network bandwidth, while newer representations such as neural radiance fields suffer from poor frame rates due to their non-standard volumetric rendering pipeline. 3D Gaussian splats (3DGS) can be seen as a generalization of point clouds that meet the best of both worlds, with high visual quality and efficient rendering for real-time frame rates. However, delivering 3DGS scenes from a hosting server to client devices is still challenging due to high network data consumption (e.g., 1.5 GB for a single scene). The goal of this work is to create an efficient 3D content delivery framework that allows users to view high quality 3D scenes with 3DGS as the underlying data representation. The main contributions of the paper are: (1) Creating new layered 3DGS scenes for efficient delivery, (2) Scheduling algorithms to choose what splats to download at what time, and (3) Trace-driven experiments from users wearing virtual reality headsets to evaluate the visual quality and latency. Our system for Layered 3D Gaussian Splats delivery L3GS demonstrates high visual quality, achieving 16.9% higher average SSIM compared to baselines, and also works with other compressed 3DGS representations."
2504.05544,"We propose a method for authoring non-realistic 3D objects (represented as either 3D Gaussian Splats or meshes), that comply with 2D edits from specific viewpoints. Namely, given a 3D object, a user chooses different viewpoints and interactively deforms the object in the 2D image plane of each view. The method then produces a ""deformation field"" - an interpolation between those 2D deformations in a smooth manner as the viewpoint changes. Our core observation is that the 2D deformations do not need to be tied to an underlying object, nor share the same deformation space. We use this observation to devise a method for authoring view-dependent deformations, holding several technical contributions: first, a novel way to compositionality-blend between the 2D deformations after lifting them to 3D - this enables the user to ""stack"" the deformations similarly to layers in an editing software, each deformation operating on the results of the previous; second, a novel method to apply the 3D deformation to 3D Gaussian Splats; third, an approach to author the 2D deformations, by deforming a 2D mesh encapsulating a rendered image of the object. We show the versatility and efficacy of our method by adding cartoonish effects to objects, providing means to modify human characters, fitting 3D models to given 2D sketches and caricatures, resolving occlusions, and recreating classic non-realistic paintings as 3D models."
2504.05562,"Stochastic texture filtering (STF) has re-emerged as a technique that can bring down the cost of texture filtering of advanced texture compression methods, e.g., neural texture compression. However, during texture magnification, the swapped order of filtering and shading with STF can result in aliasing. The inability to smoothly interpolate material properties stored in textures, such as surface normals, leads to potentially undesirable appearance changes. We present a novel method to improve the quality of stochastically-filtered magnified textures and reduce the image difference compared to traditional texture filtering. When textures are magnified, nearby pixels filter similar sets of texels and we introduce techniques for sharing texel values among pixels with only a small increase in cost (0.04--0.14~ms per frame). We propose an improvement to weighted importance sampling that guarantees that our method never increases error beyond single-sample stochastic texture filtering. Under high magnification, our method has >10 dB higher PSNR than single-sample STF. Our results show greatly improved image quality both with and without spatiotemporal denoising."
2504.05604,"Three-dimensional topology optimization (TO) is a powerful technique in engineering design, but readily usable, open-source implementations remain limited within the popular Python scientific environment. This paper introduces PyTopo3D, a software framework developed to address this gap. PyTopo3D provides a feature-rich tool for 3D TO by implementing the well-established Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method and an Optimality Criteria (OC) update scheme, adapted and significantly enhanced from the efficient MATLAB code by Liu and Tovar (2014). While building on proven methodology, PyTopo3D's primary contribution is its integration and extension within Python, leveraging sparse matrix operations, optional parallel solvers, and accelerated KD-Tree sensitivity filtering for performance. Crucially, it incorporates functionalities vital for practical engineering workflows, including the direct import of complex design domains and non-design obstacles via STL files, integrated 3D visualization of the optimization process, and direct STL export of optimized geometries for manufacturing or further analysis. PyTopo3D is presented as an accessible, performance-aware tool and citable reference designed to empower engineers, students, and researchers to more easily utilize 3D TO within their existing Python-based workflows."
2504.0574,"High-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splatting methods excel at capturing fine textures but often overlook model compactness, resulting in massive splat counts, bloated memory, long training, and complex post-processing. We present Micro-Splatting: Two-Stage Adaptive Growth and Refinement, a unified, in-training pipeline that preserves visual detail while drastically reducing model complexity without any post-processing or auxiliary neural modules. In Stage I (Growth), we introduce a trace-based covariance regularization to maintain near-isotropic Gaussians, mitigating low-pass filtering in high-frequency regions and improving spherical-harmonic color fitting. We then apply gradient-guided adaptive densification that subdivides splats only in visually complex regions, leaving smooth areas sparse. In Stage II (Refinement), we prune low-impact splats using a simple opacity-scale importance score and merge redundant neighbors via lightweight spatial and feature thresholds, producing a lean yet detail-rich model. On four object-centric benchmarks, Micro-Splatting reduces splat count and model size by up to 60% and shortens training by 20%, while matching or surpassing state-of-the-art PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS in real-time rendering. These results demonstrate that Micro-Splatting delivers both compactness and high fidelity in a single, efficient, end-to-end framework."
2504.0575,"Radiative backpropagation-based (RB) methods efficiently compute reverse-mode derivatives in physically-based differentiable rendering by simulating the propagation of differential radiance. A key assumption is that differential radiance is transported like normal radiance. We observe that this holds only when scene geometry is static and demonstrate that current implementations of radiative backpropagation produce biased gradients when scene parameters change geometry. In this work, we derive the differential transport equation without assuming static geometry. An immediate consequence is that the parameterization matters when the sampling process is not differentiated: only surface integrals allow a local formulation of the derivatives, i.e., one in which moving surfaces do not affect the entire path geometry. While considerable effort has been devoted to handling discontinuities resulting from moving geometry, we show that a biased interior derivative compromises even the simplest inverse rendering tasks, regardless of discontinuities. An implementation based on our derivation leads to systematic convergence to the reference solution in the same setting and provides unbiased RB interior derivatives for path-space differentiable rendering."
2504.05803,"Recent talking head synthesis works typically adopt speech features extracted from large-scale pre-trained acoustic models. However, the intrinsic many-to-many relationship between speech and lip motion causes phoneme-viseme alignment ambiguity, leading to inaccurate and unstable lips. To further improve lip sync accuracy, we propose PASE (Phoneme-Aware Speech Encoder), a novel speech representation model that bridges the gap between phonemes and visemes. PASE explicitly introduces phoneme embeddings as alignment anchors and employs a contrastive alignment module to enhance the discriminability between corresponding audio-visual pairs. In addition, a prediction and reconstruction task is designed to improve robustness under noise and partial modality absence. Experimental results show PASE significantly improves lip sync accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance across both NeRF- and 3DGS-based rendering frameworks, outperforming conventional methods based on acoustic features by 13.7 % and 14.2 %, respectively. Importantly, PASE can be seamlessly integrated into diverse talking head pipelines to improve the lip sync accuracy without architectural modifications."
2504.0631,"This study presents a spiral-based complete coverage strategy for ball-end milling on freeform surfaces, utilizing conformal slit mapping to generate milling trajectories that are more compact, smoother, and evenly distributed when machining 2D cavities with islands. This approach, an upgrade from traditional methods, extends the original algorithm to effectively address 3D perforated surface milling. Unlike conventional algorithms, the method embeds a continuous spiral trajectory within perforated surfaces without requiring cellular decomposition or additional boundaries. The proposed method addresses three primary challenges, including modifying conformal slit mapping for mesh surfaces, maintaining uniform scallop height between adjacent spiral trajectories, and optimizing the mapped origin point to ensure uniform scallop height distribution. To overcome these challenges, surface flattening techniques are incorporated into the original approach to accommodate mesh surfaces effectively. Tool path spacing is then optimized using a binary search strategy to regulate scallop height. A functional energy metric associated with scallop height uniformity is introduced for rapid evaluation of points mapped to the origin, with the minimum functional energy determined through perturbation techniques. The optimal placement of this point is identified using a modified gradient descent approach applied to the energy function. Validation on intricate surfaces, including low-quality and high-genus meshes, verifies the robustness of the algorithm. Surface milling experiments comparing this method with conventional techniques indicate a 15.63% improvement in scallop height uniformity while reducing machining time, average spindle impact, and spindle impact variance by up to 7.36%, 27.79%, and 55.98%, respectively."
2504.06385,"Geometric consistency, i.e. the preservation of neighbourhoods, is a natural and strong prior in 3D shape matching. Geometrically consistent matchings are crucial for many downstream applications, such as texture transfer or statistical shape modelling. Yet, in practice, geometric consistency is often overlooked, or only achieved under severely limiting assumptions (e.g. a good initialisation). In this work, we propose a novel formalism for computing globally optimal and geometrically consistent matchings between 3D shapes which is scalable in practice. Our key idea is to represent the surface of the source shape as a collection of cyclic paths, which are then consistently matched to the target shape. Mathematically, we construct a hyper product graph (between source and target shape), and then cast 3D shape matching as a minimum-cost circulation flow problem in this hyper graph, which yields global geometrically consistent matchings between both shapes. We empirically show that our formalism is efficiently solvable and that it leads to high-quality results."
2504.06598,"3D Gaussian splatting has been widely adopted as a 3D representation for novel-view synthesis, relighting, and 3D generation tasks. It delivers realistic and detailed results through a collection of explicit 3D Gaussian primitives, each carrying opacity and view-dependent color. However, efficient rendering of many transparent primitives remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches either rasterize the Gaussians with approximate per-view sorting or rely on high-end RTX GPUs. This paper proposes a stochastic ray-tracing method to render 3D clouds of transparent primitives. Instead of processing all ray-Gaussian intersections in sequential order, each ray traverses the acceleration structure only once, randomly accepting and shading a single intersection (or $N$ intersections, using a simple extension). This approach minimizes shading time and avoids primitive sorting along the ray, thereby minimizing register usage and maximizing parallelism even on low-end GPUs. The cost of rays through the Gaussian asset is comparable to that of standard mesh-intersection rays. The shading is unbiased and has low variance, as our stochastic acceptance achieves importance sampling based on accumulated weight. The alignment with Monte Carlo philosophy simplifies implementation and integration into a conventional path-tracing framework."
2504.07134,"The recent rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI), powered by Transformer networks, has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, computer vision, and graphics. However, the application of Transformers in computer-aided design (CAD), particularly for processing boundary representation (B-rep) models, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach for adapting Transformers to B-rep learning, called the Boundary Representation Transformer (BRT). B-rep models pose unique challenges due to their irregular topology and continuous geometric definitions, which are fundamentally different from the structured and discrete data Transformers are designed for. To address this, BRT proposes a continuous geometric embedding method that encodes B-rep surfaces (trimmed and untrimmed) into Bezier triangles, preserving their shape and continuity without discretization. Additionally, BRT employs a topology-aware embedding method that organizes these geometric embeddings into a sequence of discrete tokens suitable for Transformers, capturing both geometric and topological characteristics within B-rep models. This enables the Transformer's attention mechanism to effectively learn shape patterns and contextual semantics of boundary elements in a B-rep model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BRT achieves state-of-the-art performance in part classification and feature recognition tasks."
2504.0721,"Terrain modeling has traditionally relied on procedural techniques, which often require extensive domain expertise and handcrafted rules.

This approach leverages large-scale geospatial information to generate high-quality terrain samples from text descriptions, showcasing a flexible and scalable solution for terrain generation. The model's capabilities are demonstrated through extensive experiments, highlighting its ability to generate realistic and diverse terrain landscapes.

2504.07485,"In this technical report, we discuss several approaches to in-core rendering of large volumetric datasets in Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). We explore the following methods: the TBRayMarcher Plugin, the Niagara Fluids Plugin , and various approaches using Sparse Volume Textures (SVT), with a particular focus on Heterogeneous Volumes (HV). We found the HV approach to be the most promising. The biggest challenge we encountered with other approaches was the need to chunk datasets so that each fits into volume textures smaller than one gigavoxel. While this enables display of the entire dataset at reasonable frame rates, it introduces noticeable artifacts at chunk borders due to incorrect lighting, as each chunk lacks information about its neighbors. After addressing some (signed) int32 overflows in the Engine's SVT-related source code by converting them to to (unsigned) uint32 or int64, the SVT-based HV system allows us to render sparse datasets up to 32k x 32k x 16k voxels, provided the compressed tile data (including MIP data and padding for correct interpolation) does not exceed 4 gigavoxels. In the future, we intend to extend the existing SVT streaming functionality to support out-of-core rendering, in order to eventually overcome VRAM limitations, graphics API constraints, and the performance issues associated with 64-bit arithmetic in GPU shaders."
2504.07739,"We present a novel implicit porous flow solver using SPH, which maintains fluid incompressibility and is able to model a wide range of scenarios, driven by strongly coupled solid-fluid interaction forces. Many previous SPH porous flow methods reduce particle volumes as they transition across the solid-fluid interface, resulting in significant stability issues. We instead allow fluid and solid to overlap by deriving a new density estimation. This further allows us to extend modern SPH pressure solvers to take local porosity into account and results in strict enforcement of incompressibility. As a result, we can simulate porous flow using physically consistent pressure forces between fluid and solid. In contrast to previous SPH porous flow methods, which use explicit forces for internal fluid flow, we employ implicit non-pressure forces. These we solve as a linear system and strongly couple with fluid viscosity and solid elasticity. We capture the most common effects observed in porous flow, namely drag, buoyancy and capillary action due to adhesion. To achieve elastic behavior change based on local fluid saturation, such as bloating or softening, we propose an extension to the elasticity model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model with various simulations that showcase the different aspects of porous flow behavior. To summarize, our system of strongly coupled non-pressure forces and enforced incompressibility across overlapping phases allows us to naturally model and stably simulate complex porous interactions."
2504.07998,"Fine-tuning large diffusion models for custom applications demands substantial power and time, which poses significant challenges for efficient implementation on mobile devices. In this paper, we develop a novel training accelerator specifically for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of diffusion models, aiming to streamline the process and reduce computational complexity. By leveraging a fully quantized training scheme for LoRA fine-tuning, we achieve substantial reductions in memory usage and power consumption while maintaining high model fidelity. The proposed accelerator features flexible dataflow, enabling high utilization for irregular and variable tensor shapes during the LoRA process. Experimental results show up to 1.81x training speedup and 5.50x energy efficiency improvements compared to the baseline, with minimal impact on image generation quality."
2504.07999,"Generative models have recently gained increasing attention in image generation and editing tasks. However, they often lack a direct connection to object geometry, which is crucial in sensitive domains such as computational anatomy, biology, and robotics. This paper presents a novel framework for Image Generation informed by Geodesic dynamics (IGG) in deformation spaces. Our IGG model comprises two key components: (i) an efficient autoencoder that explicitly learns the geodesic path of image transformations in the latent space; and (ii) a latent geodesic diffusion model that captures the distribution of latent representations of geodesic deformations conditioned on text instructions. By leveraging geodesic paths, our method ensures smooth, topology-preserving, and interpretable deformations, capturing complex variations in image structures while maintaining geometric consistency. We validate the proposed IGG on plant growth data and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Experimental results show that IGG outperforms the state-of-the-art image generation/editing models with superior performance in generating realistic, high-quality images with preserved object topology and reduced artifacts. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL."
2504.08022,"Childlike human figure drawings represent one of humanity's most accessible forms of character expression, yet automatically analyzing their contents remains a significant challenge. While semantic segmentation of realistic humans has recently advanced considerably, existing models often fail when confronted with the abstract, representational nature of childlike drawings. This semantic understanding is a crucial prerequisite for animation tools that seek to modify figures while preserving their unique style. To help achieve this, we propose a novel hierarchical segmentation model, built upon the architecture and pre-trained SAM, to quickly and accurately obtain these semantic labels. Our model achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art segmentation models focused on realistic humans and cartoon figures, even after fine-tuning. We demonstrate the value of our model for semantic segmentation through multiple applications: a fully automatic facial animation pipeline, a figure relighting pipeline, improvements to an existing childlike human figure drawing animation method, and generalization to out-of-domain figures. Finally, to support future work in this area, we introduce a dataset of 16,000 childlike drawings with pixel-level annotations across 25 semantic categories. Our work can enable entirely new, easily accessible tools for hand-drawn character animation, and our dataset can enable new lines of inquiry in a variety of graphics and human-centric research fields."
2504.08353,"Reconstructing 3D clothed humans from images is fundamental to applications like virtual try-on, avatar creation, and mixed reality. While recent advances have enhanced human body recovery, accurate reconstruction of garment geometry -- especially for loose-fitting clothing -- remains an open challenge. We present a novel method for high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from single images that bridges 2D and 3D representations. Our approach combines Implicit Sewing Patterns (ISP) with a generative diffusion model to learn rich garment shape priors in a 2D UV space. A key innovation is our mapping model that establishes correspondences between 2D image pixels, UV pattern coordinates, and 3D geometry, enabling joint optimization of both 3D garment meshes and the corresponding 2D patterns by aligning learned priors with image observations. Despite training exclusively on synthetically simulated cloth data, our method generalizes effectively to real-world images, outperforming existing approaches on both tight- and loose-fitting garments. The reconstructed garments maintain physical plausibility while capturing fine geometric details, enabling downstream applications including garment retargeting and texture manipulation."
2504.08366,"We pose a new problem, In-2-4D, for generative 4D (i.e., 3D + motion) inbetweening to interpolate two single-view images. In contrast to video/4D generation from only text or a single image, our interpolative task can leverage more precise motion control to better constrain the generation. Given two monocular RGB images representing the start and end states of an object in motion, our goal is to generate and reconstruct the motion in 4D, without making assumptions on the object category, motion type, length, or complexity. To handle such arbitrary and diverse motions, we utilize a foundational video interpolation model for motion prediction. However, large frame-to-frame motion gaps can lead to ambiguous interpretations. To this end, we employ a hierarchical approach to identify keyframes that are visually close to the input states while exhibiting significant motions, then generate smooth fragments between them. For each fragment, we construct a 3D representation of the keyframe using Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The temporal frames within the fragment guide the motion, enabling their transformation into dynamic 3DGS through a deformation field. To improve temporal consistency and refine the 3D motion, we expand the self-attention of multi-view diffusion across timesteps and apply rigid transformation regularization. Finally, we merge the independently generated 3D motion segments by interpolating boundary deformation fields and optimizing them to align with the guiding video, ensuring smooth and flicker-free transitions. Through extensive qualitative and quantitive experiments as well as a user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and design choices."

2504.08541,"We introduce the Digital Twin Catalog (DTC), a new large-scale photorealistic 3D object digital twin dataset. A digital twin of a 3D object is a highly detailed, virtually indistinguishable representation of a physical object, accurately capturing its shape, appearance, physical properties, and other attributes. Recent advances in neural-based 3D reconstruction and inverse rendering have significantly improved the quality of 3D object reconstruction. Despite these advancements, there remains a lack of a large-scale, digital twin-quality real-world dataset and benchmark that can quantitatively assess and compare the performance of different reconstruction methods, as well as improve reconstruction quality through training or fine-tuning. Moreover, to democratize 3D digital twin creation, it is essential to integrate creation techniques with next-generation egocentric computing platforms, such as AR glasses. Currently, there is no dataset available to evaluate 3D object reconstruction using egocentric captured images. To address these gaps, the DTC dataset features 2,000 scanned digital twin-quality 3D objects, along with image sequences captured under different lighting conditions using DSLR cameras and egocentric AR glasses. This dataset establishes the first comprehensive real-world evaluation benchmark for 3D digital twin creation tasks, offering a robust foundation for comparing and improving existing reconstruction methods. The DTC dataset is already released atthis https URLand we will also make the baseline evaluations open-source."
2504.08548,"In remote sensing, multi-modal data from various sensors capturing the same scene offers rich opportunities, but learning a unified representation across these modalities remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods have often been limited to single or dual-modality approaches. In this paper, we introduce COP-GEN-Beta, a generative diffusion model trained on optical, radar, and elevation data from the Major TOM dataset. What sets COP-GEN-Beta apart is its ability to map any subset of modalities to any other, enabling zero-shot modality translation after training. This is achieved through a sequence-based diffusion transformer, where each modality is controlled by its own timestep embedding. We extensively evaluate COP-GEN-Beta on thumbnail images from the Major TOM dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality samples. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations validate the model's performance, highlighting its potential as a powerful pre-trained model for future remote sensing tasks."
2504.08937,"In image fusion tasks, the absence of real fused images as priors presents a fundamental challenge. Most deep learning-based fusion methods rely on large-scale paired datasets to extract global weighting features from raw images, thereby generating fused outputs that approximate real fused images. In contrast to previous studies, this paper explores few-shot training of neural networks under the condition of having prior knowledge. We propose a novel fusion framework named GBFF, and a Granular Ball Significant Extraction algorithm specifically designed for the few-shot prior setting. All pixel pairs involved in the fusion process are initially modeled as a Coarse-Grained Granular Ball. At the local level, Fine-Grained Granular Balls are used to slide through the brightness space to extract Non-Salient Pixel Pairs, and perform splitting operations to obtain Salient Pixel Pairs. Pixel-wise weights are then computed to generate a pseudo-supervised image. At the global level, pixel pairs with significant contributions to the fusion process are categorized into the Positive Region, while those whose contributions cannot be accurately determined are assigned to the Boundary Region. The Granular Ball performs modality-aware adaptation based on the proportion of the positive region, thereby adjusting the neural network's loss function and enabling it to complement the information of the boundary region. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed algorithm and the underlying theory. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach shows strong competitiveness in terms of both fusion time and image expressiveness. Our code is publicly available at:"
2504.09209,"Masked modeling framework has shown promise in co-speech motion generation. However, it struggles to identify semantically significant frames for effective motion masking. In this work, we propose a speech-queried attention-based mask modeling framework for co-speech motion generation. Our key insight is to leverage motion-aligned speech features to guide the masked motion modeling process, selectively masking rhythm-related and semantically expressive motion frames. Specifically, we first propose a motion-audio alignment module (MAM) to construct a latent motion-audio joint space. In this space, both low-level and high-level speech features are projected, enabling motion-aligned speech representation using learnable speech queries. Then, a speech-queried attention mechanism (SQA) is introduced to compute frame-level attention scores through interactions between motion keys and speech queries, guiding selective masking toward motion frames with high attention scores. Finally, the motion-aligned speech features are also injected into the generation network to facilitate co-speech motion generation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirm that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, successfully producing high-quality co-speech motion."
2504.09413,"We propose a two-stage framework for motion in-betweening that combines diffusion-based motion generation with physics-based character adaptation. In Stage 1, a character-agnostic diffusion model synthesizes transitions from sparse keyframes on a canonical skeleton, allowing the same model to generalize across diverse characters. In Stage 2, a reinforcement learning-based controller adapts the canonical motion to the target character's morphology and dynamics, correcting artifacts and enhancing stylistic realism. This design supports scalable motion generation across characters with diverse skeletons without retraining the entire model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and stylized characters demonstrate that our method produces physically plausible, style-consistent motions under sparse and long-range constraints."
2504.09553,"Materials exhibit geometric structures across mesoscopic to microscopic scales, influencing macroscale properties such as appearance, mechanical strength, and thermal behavior. Capturing and modeling these multiscale structures is challenging but essential for computer graphics, engineering, and materials science. We present a framework inspired by hypertexture methods, using implicit functions and adaptive sphere tracing to synthesize multiscale structures on the fly without precomputation. This framework models volumetric materials with particulate, fibrous, porous, and laminar structures, allowing control over size, shape, density, distribution, and orientation. We enhance structural diversity by superimposing implicit periodic functions while improving computational efficiency. The framework also supports spatially varying particulate media, particle agglomeration, and piling on convex and concave structures, such as rock formations (mesoscale), without explicit simulation. We show its potential in the appearance modeling of volumetric materials and explore how spatially varying properties influence perceived macroscale appearance. Our framework enables seamless multiscale modeling, reconstructing procedural volumetric materials from image and signed distance field (SDF) synthetic exemplars using first-order and gradient-free optimization."
2504.09697,"Prompt-based models have demonstrated impressive prompt-following capability at image editing tasks. However, the models still struggle with following detailed editing prompts or performing local edits. Specifically, global image quality often deteriorates immediately after a single editing step. To address these challenges, we introduce SPICE, a training-free workflow that accepts arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios, accurately follows user requirements, and consistently improves image quality during more than 100 editing steps, while keeping the unedited regions intact. By synergizing the strengths of a base diffusion model and a Canny edge ControlNet model, SPICE robustly handles free-form editing instructions from the user. On a challenging realistic image-editing dataset, SPICE quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is consistently preferred by human annotators. We release the workflow implementation for popular diffusion model Web UIs to support further research and artistic exploration."
2504.09949,"Real-world image de-weathering aims at removingvarious undesirable weather-related artifacts, e.g., rain, snow,and fog. To this end, acquiring ideal training pairs isthis http URLreal-world datasets are typically constructed paired databy extracting clean and degraded images from live streamsof landscape scene on the Internet. Despite the use of strictfiltering mechanisms during collection, training pairs inevitablyencounter inconsistency in terms of lighting, object position, scenedetails, etc, making de-weathering models possibly suffer fromdeformation artifacts under non-ideal supervision. In this work,we propose a unified solution for real-world image de-weatheringwith non-ideal supervision, i.e., a pseudo-label guided learningframework, to address various inconsistencies within the realworld paired dataset. Generally, it consists of a de-weatheringmodel (De-W) and a Consistent Label Constructor (CLC), bywhich restoration result can be adaptively supervised by originalground-truth image to recover sharp textures while maintainingconsistency with the degraded inputs in non-weather contentthrough the supervision of pseudo-labels. Particularly, a Crossframe Similarity Aggregation (CSA) module is deployed withinCLC to enhance the quality of pseudo-labels by exploring thepotential complementary information of multi-frames throughgraph model. Moreover, we introduce an Information AllocationStrategy (IAS) to integrate the original ground-truth imagesand pseudo-labels, thereby facilitating the joint supervision forthe training of de-weathering model. Extensive experimentsdemonstrate that our method exhibits significant advantageswhen trained on imperfectly aligned de-weathering datasets incomparison with other approaches."
2504.09975,"Autoregressive models have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet their performance in 3D shape generation lags significantly behind that of diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce OctGPT, a novel multiscale autoregressive model for 3D shape generation that dramatically improves the efficiency and performance of prior 3D autoregressive approaches, while rivaling or surpassing state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our method employs a serialized octree representation to efficiently capture the hierarchical and spatial structures of 3D shapes. Coarse geometry is encoded via octree structures, while fine-grained details are represented by binary tokens generated using a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE), transforming 3D shapes into compact multiscale binary sequences suitable for autoregressive prediction. To address the computational challenges of handling long sequences, we incorporate octree-based transformers enhanced with 3D rotary positional encodings, scale-specific embeddings, and token-parallel generation schemes. These innovations reduce training time by 13 folds and generation time by 69 folds, enabling the efficient training of high-resolution 3D shapes, e.g.,$1024^3$, on just four NVIDIA 4090 GPUs only within days. OctGPT showcases exceptional versatility across various tasks, including text-, sketch-, and image-conditioned generation, as well as scene-level synthesis involving multiple objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OctGPT accelerates convergence and improves generation quality over prior autoregressive methods, offering a new paradigm for high-quality, scalable 3D content creation.

2504.11003,"3D Gaussian splatting has experienced explosive popularity in the past few years in the field of novel view synthesis. The lightweight and differentiable representation of the radiance field using the Gaussian enables rapid and high-quality reconstruction and fast rendering. However, reconstructing objects with high-frequency surface textures (e.g., fine stripes) requires many skinny Gaussian kernels because each Gaussian represents only one color if viewed from one direction. Thus, reconstructing the stripes pattern, for example, requires Gaussians for at least the number of stripes. We present 3D Gabor splatting, which augments the Gaussian kernel to represent spatially high-frequency signals using Gabor noise. The Gabor kernel is a combination of a Gaussian term and spatially fluctuating wave functions, making it suitable for representing spatial high-frequency texture. We demonstrate that our 3D Gabor splatting can reconstruct various high-frequency textures on the objects."
2504.11389,"High resolution panoramic video content is paramount for immersive experiences in Virtual Reality, but is non-trivial to collect as it requires specialized equipment and intricate camera setups. In this work, we introduce VideoPanda, a novel approach for synthesizing 360$^\circ$ videos conditioned on text or single-view video data. VideoPanda leverages multi-view attention layers to augment a video diffusion model, enabling it to generate consistent multi-view videos that can be combined into immersive panoramic content. VideoPanda is trained jointly using two conditions: text-only and single-view video, and supports autoregressive generation of long-videos. To overcome the computational burden of multi-view video generation, we randomly subsample the duration and camera views used during training and show that the model is able to gracefully generalize to generating more frames during inference. Extensive evaluations on both real-world and synthetic video datasets demonstrate that VideoPanda generates more realistic and coherent 360$^\circ$ panoramas across all input conditions compared to existing methods.

2504.11435,"We propose a containment query that is robust to the watertightness of regions bound by trimmed NURBS surfaces, as this property is difficult to guarantee for in-the-wild CAD models. Containment is determined through the generalized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is indifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape. Applying contemporary techniques for the 3D GWN to trimmed NURBS surfaces requires some form of geometric discretization, introducing computational inefficiency to the algorithm and even risking containment misclassifications near the surface. In contrast, our proposed method uses a novel reformulation of the relevant surface integral based on Stokes' theorem, which operates on the boundary and trimming curves as provided through rapidly converging adaptive quadrature. Batches of queries are further accelerated by memoizing (i.e.\ caching and reusing) quadrature node positions and tangents as they are evaluated. We demonstrate that our GWN method is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD model, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from the surface. The derived containment query is therefore robust to model non-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape."
2504.11734,"In recent years, the demand for 3D content has grown exponentially with intelligent upgrading of interactive media, extended reality (XR), and Metaverse industries. In order to overcome the limitation of traditional manual modeling approaches, such as labor-intensive workflows and prolonged production cycles, revolutionary advances have been achieved through the convergence of novel 3D representation paradigms and artificial intelligence generative technologies. In this survey, we conduct a systematically review of the cutting-edge achievements in static 3D object and scene generation, as well as establish a comprehensive technical framework through systematic categorization. Specifically, we initiate our analysis with mainstream 3D object representations, followed by in-depth exploration of two principal technical pathways in object generation: data-driven supervised learning methods and deep generative model-based approaches. Regarding scene generation, we focus on three dominant paradigms: layout-guided compositional synthesis, 2D prior-based scene generation, and rule-driven modeling. Finally, we critically examine persistent challenges in 3D generation and propose potential research directions for future investigation. This survey aims to provide readers with a structured understanding of state-of-the-art 3D generation technologies while inspiring researchers to undertake more exploration in this domain."
2504.11936,"The reconstruction of 3D objects from brain signals has gained significant attention in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures. Experiments demonstrate that our model captures salient geometric and semantic features, paving the way for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), virtual reality, and neuroprosthetics.

2504.12351,"Foundation models in digital pathology use massive datasets to learn useful compact feature representations of complex histology images. However, there is limited transparency into what drives the correlation between dataset size and performance, raising the question of whether simply adding more data to increase performance is always necessary. In this study, we propose a prototype-guided diffusion model to generate high-fidelity synthetic pathology data at scale, enabling large-scale self-supervised learning and reducing reliance on real patient samples while preserving downstream performance. Using guidance from histological prototypes during sampling, our approach ensures biologically and diagnostically meaningful variations in the generated data. We demonstrate that self-supervised features trained on our synthetic dataset achieve competitive performance despite using ~60x-760x less data than models trained on large real-world datasets. Notably, models trained using our synthetic data showed statistically comparable or better performance across multiple evaluation metrics and tasks, even when compared to models trained on orders of magnitude larger datasets. Our hybrid approach, combining synthetic and real data, further enhanced performance, achieving top results in several evaluations. These findings underscore the potential of generative AI to create compelling training data for digital pathology, significantly reducing the reliance on extensive clinical datasets and highlighting the efficiency of our approach."
2504.12451,"The rapid evolution of 3D content creation, encompassing both AI-powered methods and traditional workflows, is driving an unprecedented demand for automated rigging solutions that can keep pace with the increasing complexity and diversity of 3D models. We introduce UniRig, a novel, unified framework for automatic skeletal rigging that leverages the power of large autoregressive models and a bone-point cross-attention mechanism to generate both high-quality skeletons and skinning weights. Unlike previous methods that struggle with complex or non-standard topologies, UniRig accurately predicts topologically valid skeleton structures thanks to a new Skeleton Tree Tokenization method that efficiently encodes hierarchical relationships within the skeleton. To train and evaluate UniRig, we present Rig-XL, a new large-scale dataset of over 14,000 rigged 3D models spanning a wide range of categories. UniRig significantly outperforms state-of-the-art academic and commercial methods, achieving a 215% improvement in rigging accuracy and a 194% improvement in motion accuracy on challenging datasets. Our method works seamlessly across diverse object categories, from detailed anime characters to complex organic and inorganic structures, demonstrating its versatility and robustness.

2504.1254,"Generating natural and physically plausible character motion remains challenging, particularly for long-horizon control with diverse guidance signals. While prior work combines high-level diffusion-based motion planners with low-level physics controllers, these systems suffer from domain gaps that degrade motion quality and require task-specific fine-tuning. To tackle this problem, we introduce UniPhys, a diffusion-based behavior cloning framework that unifies motion planning and control into a single model. UniPhys enables flexible, expressive character motion conditioned on multi-modal inputs such as text, trajectories, and goals. To address accumulated prediction errors over long sequences, UniPhys is trained with the Diffusion Forcing paradigm, learning to denoise noisy motion histories and handle discrepancies introduced by the physics simulator. This design allows UniPhys to robustly generate physically plausible, long-horizon motions. Through guided sampling, UniPhys generalizes to a wide range of control signals, including unseen ones, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments show that UniPhys outperforms prior methods in motion naturalness, generalization, and robustness across diverse control tasks."

2504.12776,"We propose a method for visualizing uncertain set systems, which differs from previous set visualization approaches that are based on certainty (an element either belongs to a set or not). Our method is inspired by storyline visualizations and parallel coordinate plots: (a) each element is represented by a vertical glyph, subdivided into bins that represent different levels of uncertainty; (b) each set is represented by an x-monotone curve that traverses element glyphs through the bins representing the level of uncertainty of their membership. Our implementation also includes optimizations to reduce visual complexity captured by the number of turns for the set curves and the number of crossings. Although several of the natural underlying optimization problems are NP-hard in theory (e.g., optimal element order, optimal set order), in practice, we can compute near-optimal solutions with respect to curve crossings with the help of a new exact algorithm for optimally ordering set curves within each element's bins. With these optimizations, the proposed method makes it easy to see set containment (the smaller set's curve is strictly below the larger set's curve). A brief design-space exploration using uncertain set-membership data, as well as multi-dimensional discrete data, shows the flexibility of the proposed approach."
2504.12788,"Drag-driven editing has become popular among designers for its ability to modify complex geometric structures through simple and intuitive manipulation, allowing users to adjust and reshape content with minimal technical skill. This drag operation has been incorporated into numerous methods to facilitate the editing of 2D images and 3D meshes in design. However, few studies have explored drag-driven editing for the widely-used 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, as deforming 3DGS while preserving shape coherence and visual continuity remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce ARAP-GS, a drag-driven 3DGS editing framework based on As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) deformation. Unlike previous 3DGS editing methods, we are the first to apply ARAP deformation directly to 3D Gaussians, enabling flexible, drag-driven geometric transformations. To preserve scene appearance after deformation, we incorporate an advanced diffusion prior for image super-resolution within our iterative optimization process. This approach enhances visual quality while maintaining multi-view consistency in the edited results. Experiments show that ARAP-GS outperforms current methods across diverse 3D scenes, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority for drag-driven 3DGS editing. Additionally, our method is highly efficient, requiring only 10 to 20 minutes to edit a scene on a single RTX 3090 GPU."
2504.128,"As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains popularity as a 3D representation of real scenes, enabling user-friendly deformation to create novel scenes while preserving fine details from the original 3DGS has attracted significant research attention. We introduce CAGE-GS, a cage-based 3DGS deformation method that seamlessly aligns a source 3DGS scene with a user-defined target shape. Our approach learns a deformation cage from the target, which guides the geometric transformation of the source scene. While the cages effectively control structural alignment, preserving the textural appearance of 3DGS remains challenging due to the complexity of covariance parameters. To address this, we employ a Jacobian matrix-based strategy to update the covariance parameters of each Gaussian, ensuring texture fidelity post-deformation. Our method is highly flexible, accommodating various target shape representations, including texts, images, point clouds, meshes and 3DGS models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on both public datasets and newly proposed scenes demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques in both efficiency and deformation quality."
2504.12811,"Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D reconstruction, it still faces challenges such as aliasing, projection artifacts, and view inconsistencies, primarily due to the simplification of treating splats as 2D entities. We argue that incorporating full 3D evaluation of Gaussians throughout the 3DGS pipeline can effectively address these issues while preserving rasterization efficiency. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive 3D smoothing filter to mitigate aliasing and present a stable view-space bounding method that eliminates popping artifacts when Gaussians extend beyond the view frustum. Furthermore, we promote tile-based culling to 3D with screen-space planes, accelerating rendering and reducing sorting costs for hierarchical rasterization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on in-distribution evaluation sets and significantly outperforms other approaches for out-of-distribution views. Our qualitative evaluations further demonstrate the effective removal of aliasing, distortions, and popping artifacts, ensuring real-time, artifact-free rendering."
2504.12856,"Large pretrained vision foundation models have shown significant potential in various vision tasks. However, for industrial anomaly detection, the scarcity of real defect samples poses a critical challenge in leveraging these models. While 2D anomaly generation has significantly advanced with established generative models, the adoption of 3D sensors in industrial manufacturing has made leveraging 3D data for surface quality inspection an emerging trend. In contrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored, limiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address this gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS, based on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates realistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane, sampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the point cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization experiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale, perturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the generated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from pronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our cross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet geometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to their specific surface characteristics. We also provide a comprehensive codebase and visualization toolkit to facilitate future research."
2504.12909,"Many works have succeeded in reconstructing Gaussian human avatars from multi-view videos. However, they either struggle to capture pose-dependent appearance details with a single MLP, or rely on a computationally intensive neural network to reconstruct high-fidelity appearance but with rendering performance degraded to non-real-time. We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar representation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance with details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is empowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on different positions on human body. The parameters stored in each Gaussian are obtained by interpolating from the outputs of its nearby MLPs based on their distances. To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during interpolation, for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis, and a linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative to the neutral properties. Then we propose to let the MLPs output a set of coefficients corresponding to the basis. In this way, although Gaussian coefficients are derived from interpolation and change smoothly, the Gaussian offset basis is learned freely without constraints. The smoothly varying coefficients combined with freely learned basis can still produce distinctly different Gaussian property offsets, allowing the ability to learn high-frequency spatial signals. We further use control points to constrain the Gaussians distributed on a surface layer rather than allowing them to be irregularly distributed inside the body, to help the human avatar generalize better when animated under novel poses. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, our method achieves better appearance quality with finer details while the rendering speed is significantly faster under novel views and novel poses."
2504.12999,"Photorealistic avatars have become essential for immersive applications in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), enabling lifelike interactions in areas such as training simulations, telemedicine, and virtual collaboration. These avatars bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds, improving the user experience through realistic human representation. However, existing avatar creation techniques face significant challenges, including high costs, long creation times, and limited utility in virtual applications. Manual methods, such as MetaHuman, require extensive time and expertise, while automatic approaches, such as NeRF-based pipelines often lack efficiency, detailed facial expression fidelity, and are unable to be rendered at a speed sufficent for real-time applications. By involving several cutting-edge modern techniques, we introduce an end-to-end 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) avatar creation pipeline that leverages monocular video input to create a scalable and efficient photorealistic avatar directly compatible with the Unity game engine.

2504.13022,"Gaussian splatting demonstrates proficiency for 3D scene modeling but suffers from substantial data volume due to inherent primitive redundancy. To enable future photorealistic 3D immersive visual communication applications, significant compression is essential for transmission over the existing Internet infrastructure. Hence, we propose Compressed Gaussian Splatting (CompGS++), a novel framework that leverages compact Gaussian primitives to achieve accurate 3D modeling with substantial size reduction for both static and dynamic scenes. Our design is based on the principle of eliminating redundancy both between and within primitives. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive prediction paradigm to address inter-primitive redundancy through spatial and temporal primitive prediction modules. The spatial primitive prediction module establishes predictive relationships for scene primitives and enables most primitives to be encoded as compact residuals, substantially reducing the spatial redundancy. We further devise a temporal primitive prediction module to handle dynamic scenes, which exploits primitive correlations across timestamps to effectively reduce temporal redundancy. Moreover, we devise a rate-constrained optimization module that jointly minimizes reconstruction error and rate consumption. This module effectively eliminates parameter redundancy within primitives and enhances the overall compactness of scene representations. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CompGS++ significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior compression performance while preserving accurate scene modeling. Our implementation will be made publicly available on GitHub to facilitate further research."

In this paper, we present HiScene, a novel hierarchical framework that bridges the gap between 2D image generation and 3D object generation and delivers high-fidelity scenes with compositional identities and aesthetic scene content. Our key insight is treating scenes as hierarchical ""objects"" under isometric views, where a room functions as a complex object that can be further decomposed into manipulatable items. This hierarchical approach enables us to generate 3D content that aligns with 2D representations while maintaining compositional structure. To ensure completeness and spatial alignment of each decomposed instance, we develop a video-diffusion-based amodal completion technique that effectively handles occlusions and shadows between objects, and introduce shape prior injection to ensure spatial coherence within the scene. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces more natural object arrangements and complete object instances suitable for interactive applications, while maintaining physical plausibility and alignment with user inputs."
2504.13204,"3D Gaussian Splatting reconstructs scenes by starting from a sparse Structure-from-Motion initialization and iteratively refining under-reconstructed regions. This process is inherently slow, as it requires multiple densification steps where Gaussians are repeatedly split and adjusted, following a lengthy optimization path. Moreover, this incremental approach often leads to suboptimal renderings, particularly in high-frequency regions where detail is critical.We propose a fundamentally different approach: we eliminate densification process with a one-step approximation of scene geometry using triangulated pixels from dense image correspondences. This dense initialization allows us to estimate rough geometry of the scene while preserving rich details from input RGB images, providing each Gaussian with well-informed colors, scales, and positions. As a result, we dramatically shorten the optimization path and remove the need for densification. Unlike traditional methods that rely on sparse keypoints, our dense initialization ensures uniform detail across the scene, even in high-frequency regions where 3DGS and other methods struggle. Moreover, since all splats are initialized in parallel at the start of optimization, we eliminate the need to wait for densification to adjust new Gaussians.Our method not only outperforms speed-optimized models in training efficiency but also achieves higher rendering quality than state-of-the-art approaches, all while using only half the splats of standard 3DGS. It is fully compatible with other 3DGS acceleration techniques, making it a versatile and efficient solution that can be integrated with existing approaches."
2504.13206,"We tackle the challenge of jointly personalizing content and style from a few examples. A promising approach is to train separate Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) and merge them effectively, preserving both content and style. Existing methods, such as ZipLoRA, treat content and style as independent entities, merging them by learning masks in LoRA's output dimensions. However, content and style are intertwined, not independent. To address this, we propose DuoLoRA, a content-style personalization framework featuring three key components: (i) rank-dimension mask learning, (ii) effective merging via layer priors, and (iii) Constyle loss, which leverages cycle-consistency in the merging process. First, we introduce ZipRank, which performs content-style merging within the rank dimension, offering adaptive rank flexibility and significantly reducing the number of learnable parameters. Additionally, we incorporate SDXL layer priors to apply implicit rank constraints informed by each layer's content-style bias and adaptive merger initialization, enhancing the integration of content and style. To further refine the merging process, we introduce Constyle loss, which leverages the cycle-consistency between content and style. Our experimental results demonstrate that DuoLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art content-style merging methods across multiple benchmarks."
2504.13207,"Road surface is the sole contact medium for wheels or robot feet. Reconstructing road surface is crucial for unmanned vehicles and mobile robots. Recent studies on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have achieved remarkable results in scene reconstruction. However, they typically rely on multi-view image inputs and require prolonged optimization times. In this paper, we propose BEV-GS, a real-time single-frame road surface reconstruction method based on feed-forward Gaussian splatting. BEV-GS consists of a prediction module and a rendering module. The prediction module introduces separate geometry and texture networks following Bird's-Eye-View paradigm. Geometric and texture parameters are directly estimated from a single frame, avoiding per-scene optimization. In the rendering module, we utilize grid Gaussian for road surface representation and novel view synthesis, which better aligns with road surface characteristics. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the real-world dataset RSRD. The road elevation error reduces to 1.73 cm, and the PSNR of novel view synthesis reaches 28.36 dB. The prediction and rendering FPS is 26, and 2061, respectively, enabling high-accuracy and real-time applications. The code will be available at: \href{this https URL}{\texttt{this https URL}}"
2504.13226,"With deeper exploration of diffusion model, developments in the field of image generation have triggered a boom in image creation. As the quality of base-model generated images continues to improve, so does the demand for further application like image editing. In recent years, many remarkable works are realizing a wide variety of editing effects. However, the wide variety of editing types and diverse editing approaches have made it difficult for researchers to establish a comprehensive view of the development of this field. In this survey, we summarize the image editing field from four aspects: tasks definition, methods classification, results evaluation and editing datasets. First, we provide a definition of image editing, which in turn leads to a variety of editing task forms from the perspective of operation parts and manipulation actions. Subsequently, we categorize and summary methods for implementing editing into three categories: inversion-based, fine-tuning-based and adapter-based. In addition, we organize the currently used metrics, available datasets and corresponding construction methods. At the end, we present some visions for the future development of the image editing field based on the previous summaries."
2504.13339,"While HPC resources are increasingly being used to produce adaptively refined or unstructured volume datasets, current research in applying machine learning-based representation to visualization has largely ignored this type of data. To address this, we introduce Volume Encoding Gaussians (VEG), a novel 3D Gaussian-based representation for scientific volume visualization focused on unstructured volumes. Unlike prior 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods that store view-dependent color and opacity for each Gaussian, VEG decouple the visual appearance from the data representation by encoding only scalar values, enabling transfer-function-agnostic rendering of 3DGS models for interactive scientific visualization. VEG are directly initialized from volume datasets, eliminating the need for structure-from-motion pipelines like COLMAP. To ensure complete scalar field coverage, we introduce an opacity-guided training strategy, using differentiable rendering with multiple transfer functions to optimize our data representation. This allows VEG to preserve fine features across the full scalar range of a dataset while remaining independent of any specific transfer function. Each Gaussian is scaled and rotated to adapt to local geometry, allowing for efficient representation of unstructured meshes without storing mesh connectivity and while using far fewer primitives. Across a diverse set of data, VEG achieve high reconstruction quality, compress large volume datasets by up to 3600x, and support lightning-fast rendering on commodity GPUs, enabling interactive visualization of large-scale structured and unstructured volumes."
2504.13378,"Generating high-quality, photorealistic textures for 3D human avatars remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision and multimedia field. However, real paired front and back images of human subjects are rarely available with privacy, ethical and cost of acquisition, which restricts scalability of the data. Additionally, learning priors from image inputs using deep generative models, such as GANs or diffusion models, to infer unseen regions such as the human back often leads to artifacts, structural inconsistencies, or loss of fine-grained detail. To address these issues, we present SMPL-GPTexture (skinned multi-person linear model - general purpose Texture), a novel pipeline that takes natural language prompts as input and leverages a state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model to produce paired high-resolution front and back images of a human subject as the starting point for texture estimation. Using the generated paired dual-view images, we first employ a human mesh recovery model to obtain a robust 2D-to-3D SMPL alignment between image pixels and the 3D model's UV coordinates for each views. Second, we use an inverted rasterization technique that explicitly projects the observed colour from the input images into the UV space, thereby producing accurate, complete texture maps. Finally, we apply a diffusion-based inpainting module to fill in the missing regions, and the fusion mechanism then combines these results into a unified full texture map. Extensive experiments shows that our SMPL-GPTexture can generate high resolution texture aligned with user's prompts."
2504.13386,"In order to be widely applicable, speech-driven 3D head avatars must articulate their lips in accordance with speech, while also conveying the appropriate emotions with dynamically changing facial expressions. The key problem is that deterministic models produce high-quality lip-sync but without rich expressions, whereas stochastic models generate diverse expressions but with lower lip-sync quality. To get the best of both, we seek a stochastic model with accurate lip-sync. To that end, we develop a new approach based on the following observation: if a method generates realistic 3D lip motions, it should be possible to infer the spoken audio from the lip motion. The inferred speech should match the original input audio, and erroneous predictions create a novel supervision signal for training 3D talking head avatars with accurate lip-sync. To demonstrate this effect, we propose THUNDER (Talking Heads Under Neural Differentiable Elocution Reconstruction), a 3D talking head avatar framework that introduces a novel supervision mechanism via differentiable sound production. First, we train a novel mesh-to-speech model that regresses audio from facial animation. Then, we incorporate this model into a diffusion-based talking avatar framework. During training, the mesh-to-speech model takes the generated animation and produces a sound that is compared to the input speech, creating a differentiable analysis-by-audio-synthesis supervision loop. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that THUNDER significantly improves the quality of the lip-sync of talking head avatars while still allowing for generation of diverse, high-quality, expressive facial animations.

2504.13436,"The Hausdorff distance is a fundamental metric with widespread applications across various fields. However, its computation remains computationally expensive, especially for large-scale datasets. In this work, we present RT-HDIST, the first Hausdorff distance algorithm accelerated by ray-tracing cores (RT-cores). By reformulating the Hausdorff distance problem as a series of nearest-neighbor searches and introducing a novel quantized index space, RT-HDIST achieves significant reductions in computational overhead while maintaining exact results. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate up to a two-order-of-magnitude speedup over prior state-of-the-art methods, underscoring RT-HDIST's potential for real-time and large-scale applications."
2504.13448,"For over half a century, the computer mouse has been the primary tool for interacting with digital data, yet it remains a limiting factor in exploring complex, multi-scale scientific images. Traditional 2D visualization methods hinder intuitive analysis of inherently 3D structures.

2504.14216,"We propose a framework for performing differentiable geometric modeling based on the Function Representation (FRep). The framework is built on top of modern libraries for performing automatic differentiation allowing us to obtain derivatives w.r.t. space or shape parameters. We demonstrate possible applications of this framework: Curvature estimation for shape interrogation, signed distance function computation and approximation and fitting shape parameters of a parametric model to data. Our framework is released as open-source."
2504.14219,"We present PRISM, a unified framework that enables multiple image generation and editing tasks in a single foundational model. Starting from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, PRISM proposes an effective fine-tuning strategy to produce RGB images along with intrinsic maps (referred to as X layers) simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, which infer intrinsic properties individually or require separate models for decomposition and conditional generation, PRISM maintains consistency across modalities by generating all intrinsic layers jointly. It supports diverse tasks, including text-to-RGBX generation, RGB-to-X decomposition, and X-to-RGBX conditional generation. Additionally, PRISM enables both global and local image editing through conditioning on selected intrinsic layers and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of PRISM both for intrinsic image decomposition and conditional image generation while preserving the base model's text-to-image generation capability."
2504.14257,"We introduce a novel representation for learning and generating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models in the form of $\textit{boundary representations}$ (B-Reps). Our representation unifies the continuous geometric properties of B-Rep primitives in different orders (e.g., surfaces and curves) and their discrete topological relations in a $\textit{holistic latent}$ (HoLa) space. This is based on the simple observation that the topological connection between two surfaces is intrinsically tied to the geometry of their intersecting curve. Such a prior allows us to reformulate topology learning in B-Reps as a geometric reconstruction problem in Euclidean space. Specifically, we eliminate the presence of curves, vertices, and all the topological connections in the latent space by learning to distinguish and derive curve geometries from a pair of surface primitives via a neural intersection network. To this end, our holistic latent space is only defined on surfaces but encodes a full B-Rep model, including the geometry of surfaces, curves, vertices, and their topological relations. Our compact and holistic latent space facilitates the design of a first diffusion-based generator to take on a large variety of inputs including point clouds, single/multi-view images, 2D sketches, and text prompts. Our method significantly reduces ambiguities, redundancies, and incoherences among the generated B-Rep primitives, as well as training complexities inherent in prior multi-step B-Rep learning pipelines, while achieving greatly improved validity rate over current state of the art: 82% vs. $\approx$50%."
2504.14272,"This study investigates how artificial intelligence (AI) recognizes style through style transfer-an AI technique that generates a new image by applying the style of one image to another. Despite the considerable interest that style transfer has garnered among researchers, most efforts have focused on enhancing the quality of output images through advanced AI algorithms. In this paper, we approach style transfer from an aesthetic perspective, thereby bridging AI techniques and aesthetics. We analyze two style transfer algorithms: one based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the other utilizing recent Transformer models. By comparing the images produced by each, we explore the elements that constitute the style of artworks through an aesthetic analysis of the style transfer results. We then elucidate the limitations of current style transfer techniques. Based on these limitations, we propose potential directions for future research on style transfer techniques."
2504.14373,"Creating photorealistic 3D head avatars from limited input has become increasingly important for applications in virtual reality, telepresence, and digital entertainment. While recent advances like neural rendering and 3D Gaussian splatting have enabled high-quality digital human avatar creation and animation, most methods rely on multiple images or multi-view inputs, limiting their practicality for real-world use. In this paper, we propose SEGA, a novel approach for Single-imagE-based 3D drivable Gaussian head Avatar creation that combines generalized prior models with a new hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework. SEGA seamlessly combines priors derived from large-scale 2D datasets with 3D priors learned from multi-view, multi-expression, and multi-ID data, achieving robust generalization to unseen identities while ensuring 3D consistency across novel viewpoints and expressions. We further present a hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework that leverages FLAME-based structural priors and employs a dual-branch architecture to disentangle dynamic and static facial components effectively. The dynamic branch encodes expression-driven fine details, while the static branch focuses on expression-invariant regions, enabling efficient parameter inference and precomputation. This design maximizes the utility of limited 3D data and achieves real-time performance for animation and rendering. Additionally, SEGA performs person-specific fine-tuning to further enhance the fidelity and realism of the generated avatars. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in generalization ability, identity preservation, and expression realism, advancing one-shot avatar creation for practical applications."
2504.1459,"As a high-level discipline, the development of remote sensing depends on the contribution of many other basic and applied disciplines and technologies. For example, due to the close relationship between remote sensing and photogrammetry, remote sensing would inevitably integrate disciplines such as optics and color science. Also, remote sensing integrates the knowledge of electronics in the conversion from optical signals to electrical signals via CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) or other image sensors. Moreover, when conducting object identification and classification with remote sensing data, mathematical morphology and other digital image processing technologies are used. These examples are only the tip of the iceberg of interdisciplinary integration of remote sensing. This work briefly reviews the interdisciplinary integration of remote sensing with four examples - ecology, mathematical morphology, machine learning, and electronics."
2504.15028,"We present a method that computes an interpretable representation of material appearance within a highly compact, disentangled latent space. This representation is learned in a self-supervised fashion using an adapted FactorVAE. We train our model with a carefully designed unlabeled dataset, avoiding possible biases induced by human-generated labels. Our model demonstrates strong disentanglement and interpretability by effectively encoding material appearance and illumination, despite the absence of explicit supervision. Then, we use our representation as guidance for training a lightweight IP-Adapter to condition a diffusion pipeline that transfers the appearance of one or more images onto a target geometry, and allows the user to further edit the resulting appearance. Our approach offers fine-grained control over the generated results: thanks to the well-structured compact latent space, users can intuitively manipulate attributes such as hue or glossiness in image space to achieve the desired final appearance."
2504.15329,"Accurate 6D pose estimation has gained more attention over the years for robotics-assisted tasks that require precise interaction with physical objects. This paper presents an interactive 3D-to-2D visualization and annotation tool to support the 6D pose estimation research community. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed work is the first tool that allows users to visualize and manipulate 3D objects interactively on a 2D real-world scene, along with a comprehensive user study. This system supports robust 6D camera pose annotation by providing both visual cues and spatial relationships to determine object position and orientation in various environments. The annotation feature in Vision6D is particularly helpful in scenarios where the transformation matrix between the camera and world objects is unknown, as it enables accurate annotation of these objects' poses using only the camera intrinsic matrix. This capability serves as a foundational step in developing and training advanced pose estimation models across various domains. We evaluate Vision6D's effectiveness by utilizing widely-used open-source pose estimation datasets Linemod and HANDAL through comparisons between the default ground-truth camera poses with manual annotations. A user study was performed to show that Vision6D generates accurate pose annotations via visual cues in an intuitive 3D user interface. This approach aims to bridge the gap between 2D scene projections and 3D scenes, offering an effective way for researchers and developers to solve 6D pose annotation related problems.

2504.15437,"Digital pathology is a tool of rapidly evolving importance within the discipline of pathology. Whole slide imaging promises numerous advantages; however, adoption is limited by challenges in ease of use and speed of high-quality image rendering relative to the simplicity and visual quality of glass slides. We introduce Iris, a new high-performance digital pathology rendering system. Specifically, we outline and detail the performance metrics of Iris Core, the core rendering engine technology. Iris Core comprises machine code modules written from the ground up in C++ and using Vulkan, a low-level and low-overhead cross-platform graphical processing unit application program interface, and our novel rapid tile buffering algorithms. We provide a detailed explanation of Iris Core's system architecture, including the stateless isolation of core processes, interprocess communication paradigms, and explicit synchronization paradigms that provide powerful control over the graphical processing unit. Iris Core achieves slide rendering at the sustained maximum frame rate on all tested platforms and buffers an entire new slide field of, view without overlapping pixels, in 10 ms with enhanced detail in 30 ms. It is able to buffer and compute high-fidelity reduction-enhancements for viewing low-power cytology with increased visual quality at a rate of 100-160 us per slide tile, and with a cumulative median buffering rate of 1.36 GB of decompressed image data per second. This buffering rate allows for an entirely new field of view to be fully buffered and rendered in less than a single monitor refresh on a standard display, and high detail features within 2-3 monitor refresh frames. These metrics far exceed previously published specifications, beyond an order of magnitude in some contexts. The system shows no slowing with high use loads, but rather increases performance due to cache mechanisms."

We design a set of losses that ensures that these neural bases approximate fundamental physical properties such as orthogonality, divergence-free, boundary alignment, and smoothness. Our neural bases can then be used to fit an input sketch of a flow, which will inherit the same fundamental properties from the bases. We then can animate such flow in real-time using standard time integrators. Our neural bases can accommodate different domains, moving boundaries, and naturally extend to three dimensions."
2504.15933,"Processing visual data often involves small adjustments or sequences of changes, e.g., image filtering, surface smoothing, and animation. While established graphics techniques like normal mapping and video compression exploit redundancy to encode such small changes efficiently, the problem of encoding small changes to neural fields -- neural network parameterizations of visual or physical functions -- has received less attention. We propose a parameter-efficient strategy for updating neural fields using low-rank adaptations (LoRA). LoRA, a method from the parameter-efficient fine-tuning LLM community, encodes small updates to pre-trained models with minimal computational overhead. We adapt LoRA for instance-specific neural fields, avoiding the need for large pre-trained models and yielding lightweight updates. We validate our approach with experiments in image filtering, geometry editing, video compression, and energy-based editing, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility for representing neural field updates."

To tackle these challenges, we introduce \textbf{HUG}, a novel approach that enhances data partitioning and reconstruction quality by leveraging a hierarchical neural Gaussian representation. We first propose a visibility-based data partitioning method that is simple yet highly efficient, significantly outperforming existing methods in speed.

2504.17062,"Realistic indoor or outdoor image synthesis is a core challenge in computer vision and graphics. The learning-based approach is easy to use but lacks physical consistency, while traditional Physically Based Rendering (PBR) offers high realism but is computationally expensive. Intrinsic image representation offers a well-balanced trade-off, decomposing images into fundamental components (intrinsic channels) such as geometry, materials, and illumination for controllable synthesis. However, existing PBR materials struggle with complex surface models, particularly high-specular and transparent surfaces. In this work, we extend intrinsic image representations to incorporate both reflection and transmission properties, enabling the synthesis of transparent materials such as glass and windows. We propose an explicit intrinsic compositing framework that provides deterministic, interpretable image synthesis. With the Extended PBR (ePBR) Materials, we can effectively edit the materials with precise controls."
2504.17614,"Clothing virtual characters is a time-consuming and often manual process. Outfits can be composed of multiple garments, and each garment must be fitted to the unique shape of a character. Since characters can vary widely in size and shape, fitting outfits to many characters is a combinatorially large problem. We present Bolt, a system designed to take outfits originally authored on a source body and fit them to new body shapes via a three stage transfer, drape, and rig process. First, our new garment transfer method transforms each garment's 3D mesh positions to the new character, then optimizes the garment's 2D sewing pattern while maintaining key features of the original seams and boundaries. Second, our system simulates the transferred garments to progressively drape and untangle each garment in the outfit. Finally, the garments are rigged to the new character. This entire process is automatic, making it feasible to clothe characters at scale with no human intervention. Clothed characters are then ready for immediate use in applications such as gaming, animation, synthetic generation, and more."
2504.17954,"In volume visualization, users can interactively explore the three-dimensional data by specifying color and opacity mappings in the transfer function (TF) or adjusting lighting parameters, facilitating meaningful interpretation of the underlying structure. However, rendering large-scale volumes demands powerful GPUs and high-speed memory access for real-time performance. While existing novel view synthesis (NVS) methods offer faster rendering speeds with lower hardware requirements, the visible parts of a reconstructed scene are fixed and constrained by preset TF settings, significantly limiting user exploration. This paper introduces inverse volume rendering via Gaussian splatting (iVR-GS), an innovative NVS method that reduces the rendering cost while enabling scene editing for interactive volume exploration. Specifically, we compose multiple iVR-GS models associated with basic TFs covering disjoint visible parts to make the entire volumetric scene visible. Each basic model contains a collection of 3D editable Gaussians, where each Gaussian is a 3D spatial point that supports real-time scene rendering and editing. We demonstrate the superior reconstruction quality and composability of iVR-GS against other NVS solutions (Plenoxels, CCNeRF, and base 3DGS) on various volume datasets.

2504.18001,"Machine learning has enabled the use of implicit neural representations (INRs) to efficiently compress and reconstruct massive scientific datasets. However, despite advances in fast INR rendering algorithms, INR-based rendering remains computationally expensive, as computing data values from an INR is significantly slower than reading them from GPU memory. This bottleneck currently restricts interactive INR visualization to professional workstations. To address this challenge, we introduce an INR rendering framework accelerated by a scalable, multi-resolution GPU cache capable of efficiently representing tera-scale datasets. By minimizing redundant data queries and prioritizing novel volume regions, our method reduces the number of INR computations per frame, achieving an average 5x speedup over the state-of-the-art INR rendering method while still maintaining high visualization quality. Coupled with existing hardware-accelerated INR compressors, our framework enables scientists to generate and compress massive datasets in situ on high-performance computing platforms and then interactively explore them on consumer-grade hardware post hoc."
2504.18768,"The emergence of neural and Gaussian-based radiance field methods has led to considerable advancements in novel view synthesis and 3D object reconstruction. Nonetheless, specular reflection and refraction continue to pose significant challenges due to the instability and incorrect overfitting of radiance fields to high-frequency light variations. Currently, even 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), as a powerful and efficient tool, falls short in recovering transparent objects with nearby contents due to the existence of apparent secondary ray effects. To address this issue, we propose TransparentGS, a fast inverse rendering pipeline for transparent objects based on 3D-GS. The main contributions are three-fold. Firstly, an efficient representation of transparent objects, transparent Gaussian primitives, is designed to enable specular refraction through a deferred refraction strategy. Secondly, we leverage Gaussian light field probes (GaussProbe) to encode both ambient light and nearby contents in a unified framework. Thirdly, a depth-based iterative probes query (IterQuery) algorithm is proposed to reduce the parallax errors in our probe-based framework. Experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our approach in recovering transparent objects from complex environments, as well as several applications in computer graphics and vision."
2504.18989,"While latent diffusion models achieve impressive image editing results, their application to iterative editing of the same image is severely restricted. When trying to apply consecutive edit operations using current models, they accumulate artifacts and noise due to repeated transitions between pixel and latent spaces. Some methods have attempted to address this limitation by performing the entire edit chain within the latent space, sacrificing flexibility by supporting only a limited, predetermined set of diffusion editing operations. We present a RE-encode decode (REED) training scheme for variational autoencoders (VAEs), which promotes image quality preservation even after many iterations. Our work enables multi-method iterative image editing: users can perform a variety of iterative edit operations, with each operation building on the output of the previous one using both diffusion-based operations and conventional editing techniques. We demonstrate the advantage of REED-VAE across a range of image editing scenarios, including text-based and mask-based editing frameworks. In addition, we show how REED-VAE enhances the overall editability of images, increasing the likelihood of successful and precise edit operations. We hope that this work will serve as a benchmark for the newly introduced task of multi-method image editing. Our code and models will be available atthis https URL"
2504.19163,"Systematically simulating specular light transport requires an exhaustive search for primitive tuples containing admissible paths. Given the extreme inefficiency of enumerating all combinations, we propose to significantly reduce the search domain by sampling such tuples. The challenge is to design proper sampling probabilities that keep the noise level controllable. Our key insight is that by bounding the range of irradiance contributed by each primitive tuple at a given position, we can sample a subset of primitive tuples with potentially high contributions. Although low-contribution tuples are assigned a negligible probability, the overall variance remains low. Therefore, we derive vertex position and irradiance bounds for each primitive tuple, introducing a bounding property of rational functions on the Bernstein basis. When formulating position and irradiance expressions into rational functions, we handle non-rational components through remainder variables to maintain validity. Finally, we carefully design the sampling probabilities by optimizing the upper bound of the variance, expressed only using the position and irradiance bound. The proposed primitive sampling is intrinsically unbiased. It can be seamlessly combined with various unbiased and biased root-finding techniques within a local primitive domain. Extensive evaluations show that our method enables fast and reliable rendering of complex caustic effects."
2504.19174,"We introduce CLR-Wire, a novel framework for 3D curve-based wireframe generation that integrates geometry and topology into a unified Continuous Latent Representation. Unlike conventional methods that decouple vertices, edges, and faces, CLR-Wire encodes curves as Neural Parametric Curves along with their topological connectivity into a continuous and fixed-length latent space using an attention-driven variational autoencoder (VAE). This unified approach facilitates joint learning and generation of both geometry and topology. To generate wireframes, we employ a flow matching model to progressively map Gaussian noise to these latents, which are subsequently decoded into complete 3D wireframes. Our method provides fine-grained modeling of complex shapes and irregular topologies, and supports both unconditional generation and generation conditioned on point cloud or image inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art generative approaches, our method achieves substantial improvements in accuracy, novelty, and diversity, offering an efficient and comprehensive solution for CAD design, geometric reconstruction, and 3D content creation."
2504.19189,"Storyboarding is widely used for creating 3D animations. Animators use the 2D sketches in storyboards as references to craft the desired 3D animations through a trial-and-error process. The traditional approach requires exceptional expertise and is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, there is a high demand for automated methods that can directly translate 2D storyboard sketches into 3D animations. This task is under-explored to date and inspired by the significant advancements of motion diffusion models, we propose to address it from the perspective of conditional motion synthesis. We thus present Sketch2Anim, composed of two key modules for sketch constraint understanding and motion generation. Specifically, due to the large domain gap between the 2D sketch and 3D motion, instead of directly conditioning on 2D inputs, we design a 3D conditional motion generator that simultaneously leverages 3D keyposes, joint trajectories, and action words, to achieve precise and fine-grained motion control. Then, we invent a neural mapper dedicated to aligning user-provided 2D sketches with their corresponding 3D keyposes and trajectories in a shared embedding space, enabling, for the first time, direct 2D control of motion generation. Our approach successfully transfers storyboards into high-quality 3D motions and inherently supports direct 3D animation editing, thanks to the flexibility of our multi-conditional motion generator. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
2504.19718,"Face registration deforms a template mesh to closely fit a 3D face scan, the quality of which commonly degrades in non-skin regions (e.g., hair, beard, accessories), because the optimized template-to-scan distance pulls the template mesh towards the noisy scan surface. Improving registration quality requires a clean separation of skin and non-skin regions on the scan mesh. Existing image-based (2D) or scan-based (3D) segmentation methods however perform poorly. Image-based segmentation outputs multi-view inconsistent masks, and they cannot account for scan inaccuracies or scan-image misalignment, while scan-based methods suffer from lower spatial resolution compared to images. In this work, we introduce a novel method that accurately separates skin from non-skin geometry on 3D human head scans. For this, our method extracts features from multi-view images using a frozen image foundation model and aggregates these features in 3D. These lifted 2D features are then fused with 3D geometric features extracted from the scan mesh, to then predict a segmentation mask directly on the scan mesh. We show that our segmentations improve the registration accuracy over pure 2D or 3D segmentation methods by 8.89% and 14.3%, respectively. Although trained only on synthetic data, our model generalizes well to real data."
2504.20403,"Personalized 3D avatar editing holds significant promise due to its user-friendliness and availability to applications such as AR/VR and virtual try-ons. Previous studies have explored the feasibility of 3D editing, but often struggle to generate visually pleasing results, possibly due to the unstable representation learning under mixed optimization of geometry and texture in complicated reconstructed scenarios. In this paper, we aim to provide an accessible solution for ordinary users to create their editable 3D avatars with precise region localization, geometric adaptability, and photorealistic renderings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a meticulously designed framework that decouples the editing process into local spatial adaptation and realistic appearance learning, utilizing a hybrid Tetrahedron-constrained Gaussian Splatting (TetGS) as the underlying representation. TetGS combines the controllable explicit structure of tetrahedral grids with the high-precision rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting and is optimized in a progressive manner comprising three stages: 3D avatar instantiation from real-world monocular videos to provide accurate priors for TetGS initialization; localized spatial adaptation with explicitly partitioned tetrahedrons to guide the redistribution of Gaussian kernels; and geometry-based appearance generation with a coarse-to-fine activation strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach in generating photorealistic 3D editable avatars."
2504.20937,"Real-time visualization of computational simulations running over graphics processing units (GPU) is a valuable feature in modern science and technological research, as it allows researchers to visually assess the quality and correctness of their computational models during the simulation. Due to the high throughput involved in GPU-based simulations, classical visualization approaches such as ones based on copying to RAM or storage are not feasible anymore, as they imply large memory transfers between GPU and CPU at each moment, reducing both computational performance and interactivity. Implementing real-time visualizers for GPU simulation codes is a challenging task as it involves dealing with i) low-level integration of graphics APIs (e.g, OpenGL and Vulkan) into the general-purpose GPU code, ii) a careful and efficient handling of memory spaces and iii) finding a balance between rendering and computing as both need the GPU resources. In this work we present Mìmir, a CUDA/Vulkan interoperability C++ library that allows users to add real-time 2D/3D visualization to CUDA codes with low programming effort. With Mìmir, researchers can leverage state-of-the-art CUDA/Vulkan interoperability features without needing to invest time in learning the complex low-level technical aspects involved. Internally, Mìmir streamlines the interoperability mapping between CUDA device memory containing simulation data and Vulkan graphics resources, so that changes on the data are instantly reflected in the visualization. This abstraction scheme allows generating visualizations with minimal alteration over the original source code, needing only to replace the GPU memory allocation lines of the data to be visualized by the API calls provided by Mìmir among other optional changes."
2504.21033,"Traditional 3D modeling requires technical expertise, specialized software, and time-intensive processes, making it inaccessible for many users. Our research aims to lower these barriers by combining generative AI and augmented reality (AR) into a cohesive system that allows users to easily generate, manipulate, and interact with 3D models in real time, directly within AR environments. Utilizing cutting-edge AI models like Shap-E, we address the complex challenges of transforming 2D images into 3D representations in AR environments. Key challenges such as object isolation, handling intricate backgrounds, and achieving seamless user interaction are tackled through advanced object detection methods, such as Mask R-CNN. Evaluation results from 35 participants reveal an overall System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 69.64, with participants who engaged with AR/VR technologies more frequently rating the system significantly higher, at 80.71.

2504.21067,"This research tackles the challenge of real-time active view selection and uncertainty quantification on visual quality for active 3D reconstruction. Visual quality is a critical aspect of 3D reconstruction. Recent advancements such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have notably enhanced the image rendering quality of reconstruction models. Nonetheless, the efficient and effective acquisition of input images for reconstruction-specifically, the selection of the most informative viewpoint-remains an open challenge, which is crucial for active reconstruction. Existing studies have primarily focused on evaluating geometric completeness and exploring unobserved or unknown regions, without direct evaluation of the visual uncertainty within the reconstruction model. To address this gap, this paper introduces a probabilistic model that quantifies visual uncertainty for each Gaussian. Leveraging Shannon Mutual Information, we formulate a criterion, Gaussian Splatting Shannon Mutual Information (GauSS-MI), for real-time assessment of visual mutual information from novel viewpoints, facilitating the selection of next best view. GauSS-MI is implemented within an active reconstruction system integrated with a view and motion planner. Extensive experiments across various simulated and real-world scenes showcase the superior visual quality and reconstruction efficiency performance of the proposed system."
2504.21216,"We propose PhysicsFC, a method for controlling physically simulated football player characters to perform a variety of football skills--such as dribbling, trapping, moving, and kicking--based on user input, while seamlessly transitioning between these skills. Our skill-specific policies, which generate latent variables for each football skill, are trained using an existing physics-based motion embedding model that serves as a foundation for reproducing football motions. Key features include a tailored reward design for the Dribble policy, a two-phase reward structure combined with projectile dynamics-based initialization for the Trap policy, and a Data-Embedded Goal-Conditioned Latent Guidance (DEGCL) method for the Move policy. Using the trained skill policies, the proposed football player finite state machine (PhysicsFC FSM) allows users to interactively control the character. To ensure smooth and agile transitions between skill policies, as defined in the FSM, we introduce the Skill Transition-Based Initialization (STI), which is applied during the training of each skill policy. We develop several interactive scenarios to showcase PhysicsFC's effectiveness, including competitive trapping and dribbling, give-and-go plays, and 11v11 football games, where multiple PhysicsFC agents produce natural and controllable physics-based football player behaviors. Quantitative evaluations further validate the performance of individual skill policies and the transitions between them, using the presented metrics and experimental designs."
2504.21627,"Neural representations have shown the potential to accelerate ray casting in a conventional ray-tracing-based rendering pipeline. We introduce a novel approach called Locally-Subdivided Neural Intersection Function (LSNIF) that replaces bottom-level BVHs used as traditional geometric representations with a neural network. Our method introduces a sparse hash grid encoding scheme incorporating geometry voxelization, a scene-agnostic training data collection, and a tailored loss function. It enables the network to output not only visibility but also hit-point information and material indices. LSNIF can be trained offline for a single object, allowing us to use LSNIF as a replacement for its corresponding BVH. With these designs, the network can handle hit-point queries from any arbitrary viewpoint, supporting all types of rays in the rendering pipeline. We demonstrate that LSNIF can render a variety of scenes, including real-world scenes designed for other path tracers, while achieving a memory footprint reduction of up to 106.2x compared to a compressed BVH."
2505.00704,"Generating realistic and controllable weather effects in videos is valuable for many applications. Physics-based weather simulation requires precise reconstructions that are hard to scale to in-the-wild videos, while current video editing often lacks realism and control. In this work, we introduce WeatherWeaver, a video diffusion model that synthesizes diverse weather effects -- including rain, snow, fog, and clouds -- directly into any input video without the need for 3D modeling. Our model provides precise control over weather effect intensity and supports blending various weather types, ensuring both realism and adaptability. To overcome the scarcity of paired training data, we propose a novel data strategy combining synthetic videos, generative image editing, and auto-labeled real-world videos. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in weather simulation and removal, providing high-quality, physically plausible, and scene-identity-preserving results over various real-world videos."
2505.01319,"Speech-driven 3D facial animation plays a key role in applications such as virtual avatars, gaming, and digital content creation. While existing methods have made significant progress in achieving accurate lip synchronization and generating basic emotional expressions, they often struggle to capture and effectively transfer nuanced performance styles. We propose a novel example-based generation framework that conditions a latent diffusion model on a reference style clip to produce highly expressive and temporally coherent facial animations. To address the challenge of accurately adhering to the style reference, we introduce a novel conditioning mechanism called style basis, which extracts key poses from the reference and additively guides the diffusion generation process to fit the style without compromising lip synchronization quality. This approach enables the model to capture subtle stylistic cues while ensuring that the generated animations align closely with the input speech. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and perceptual evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in faithfully reproducing the desired style while achieving superior lip synchronization across various speech scenarios."
2505.01425,"Human motion modeling traditionally separates motion generation and estimation into distinct tasks with specialized models. Motion generation models focus on creating diverse, realistic motions from inputs like text, audio, or keyframes, while motion estimation models aim to reconstruct accurate motion trajectories from observations like videos. Despite sharing underlying representations of temporal dynamics and kinematics, this separation limits knowledge transfer between tasks and requires maintaining separate models. We present GENMO, a unified Generalist Model for Human Motion that bridges motion estimation and generation in a single framework. Our key insight is to reformulate motion estimation as constrained motion generation, where the output motion must precisely satisfy observed conditioning signals. Leveraging the synergy between regression and diffusion, GENMO achieves accurate global motion estimation while enabling diverse motion generation. We also introduce an estimation-guided training objective that exploits in-the-wild videos with 2D annotations and text descriptions to enhance generative diversity. Furthermore, our novel architecture handles variable-length motions and mixed multimodal conditions (text, audio, video) at different time intervals, offering flexible control. This unified approach creates synergistic benefits: generative priors improve estimated motions under challenging conditions like occlusions, while diverse video data enhances generation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate GENMO's effectiveness as a generalist framework that successfully handles multiple human motion tasks within a single model."
2505.01917,"Generative diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in producing high-quality images. However, these models typically operate in continuous intensity spaces, diffusing independently across pixels and color channels. As a result, they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications involving inherently discrete quantities-such as particle counts or material units-that are constrained by strict conservation laws like mass conservation, limiting their applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time, discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete spatial domains while strictly preserving particle counts in both forward and reverse diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve particle conservation, we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis, class conditioning, and image inpainting across standard image benchmarks, while exactly conditioning total image intensity. We validate DSD on two challenging scientific applications: porous rock microstructures and lithium-ion battery electrodes, demonstrating its ability to generate structurally realistic samples under strict mass conservation constraints, with quantitative evaluation using state-of-the-art metrics for transport and electrochemical performance."
2505.01932,"Animating 3D head meshes using audio inputs has significant applications in AR/VR, gaming, and entertainment through 3D avatars. However, bridging the modality gap between speech signals and facial dynamics remains a challenge, often resulting in incorrect lip syncing and unnatural facial movements. To address this, we propose OT-Talk, the first approach to leverage optimal transportation to optimize the learning model in talking head animation. Building on existing learning frameworks, we utilize a pre-trained Hubert model to extract audio features and a transformer model to process temporal sequences. Unlike previous methods that focus solely on vertex coordinates or displacements, we introduce Chebyshev Graph Convolution to extract geometric features from triangulated meshes. To measure mesh dissimilarities, we go beyond traditional mesh reconstruction errors and velocity differences between adjacent frames. Instead, we represent meshes as probability measures and approximate their surfaces. This allows us to leverage the sliced Wasserstein distance for modeling mesh variations. This approach facilitates the learning of smooth and accurate facial motions, resulting in coherent and natural facial animations. Our experiments on two public audio-mesh datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of mesh reconstruction accuracy and temporal alignment. In addition, we conducted a user perception study with 20 volunteers to further assess the effectiveness of our approach."
2505.02017,"Voxels are among the most popular 3D geometric representations today. Due to their intuitiveness and ease-of-editing, voxels have been widely adopted in stylized games and low-cost independent games. However, the high storage cost of voxels, along with the significant time overhead associated with large-scale voxel rendering, limits the further development of open-world voxel games. In this paper, we introduce Aokana, a GPU-Driven Voxel Rendering Framework for Open World Games. Aokana is based on a Sparse Voxel Directed Acyclic Graph (SVDAG). It incorporates a Level-of-Details (LOD) mechanism and a streaming system, enabling seamless map loading as players traverse the open-world game environment. We also designed a corresponding high-performance GPU-driven voxel rendering pipeline to support real-time rendering of the voxel scenes that contain tens of billions of voxels. Aokana can be directly applied to existing game engines and easily integrated with mesh-based rendering methods, demonstrating its practical applicability in game development. Experimental evaluations show that, with increasing voxel scene resolution, Aokana can reduce memory usage by up to ninefold and achieves rendering speeds up to 4.8 times faster than those of previous state-of-the-art approaches."
2505.02041,"Efficiently calculating global illumination has always been one of the greatest challenges in computer graphics. Algorithms for approximating global illumination have always struggled to run in realtime for fully dynamic scenes, and have had to rely heavily on stochastic raytracing, spatialtemporal denoising, or undersampled representations, resulting in much lower quality of lighting compared to reference solutions. Even though the problem of calculating global illumination in 2D is significantly simpler than that of 3D, most contemporary approaches still struggle to accurately approximate 2D global illumination under realtime constraints.We present Holographic Radiance Cascades: a new single-shot scene-agnostic radiance transfer algorithm for global illumination, which is capable of achieving results visually indistinguishable from the 2D reference solution at realtime framerates. Our method uses a multi-level radiance probe system, and computes rays via combining short ray intervals as a replacement for conventional raytracing. It runs at constant cost for a given scene size, taking 1.85ms for a 512x512 pixel image and 7.67ms for 1024x1024 on an RTX 3080 Laptop."
2505.02061,A variational approach to the reconstruction of a shape (2D simple manifolds) as triangulated surface from given level set using shape gradients is presented. It involves an energy functional that depends on the local shape characteristics of the surface. Minimization of the energy through an iterative procedure using the gradient descent method yields a triangulated surface mesh which matches the boundary of the object of interest and this model ensures the smoothness of the boundary.
2505.0235,"Accurate and compact representation of signed distance functions (SDFs) of implicit surfaces is crucial for efficient storage, computation, and downstream processing of 3D geometry. In this work, we propose a general learning method for approximating precomputed SDF fields of implicit surfaces by a relatively small number of ellipsoidal radial basis functions (ERBFs). The SDF values could be computed from various sources, including point clouds, triangle meshes, analytical expressions, pretrained neural networks, etc. Given SDF values on spatial grid points, our method approximates the SDF using as few ERBFs as possible, achieving a compact representation while preserving the geometric shape of the corresponding implicit surface. To balance sparsity and approximation precision, we introduce a dynamic multi-objective optimization strategy, which adaptively incorporates regularization to enforce sparsity and jointly optimizes the weights, centers, shapes, and orientations of the ERBFs. For computational efficiency, a nearest-neighbor-based data structure restricts computations to points near each kernel center, and CUDA-based parallelism further accelerates the optimization. Furthermore, a hierarchical refinement strategy based on SDF spatial grid points progressively incorporates coarse-to-fine samples for parameter initialization and optimization, improving convergence and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can represent SDF fields with significantly fewer parameters than existing sparse implicit representation approaches, achieving better accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

2505.02592,"Garment sewing patterns are the design language behind clothing, yet their current vector-based digital representations weren't built with machine learning in mind. Vector-based representation encodes a sewing pattern as a discrete set of panels, each defined as a sequence of lines and curves, stitching information between panels and the placement of each panel around a body. However, this representation causes two major challenges for neural networks: discontinuity in latent space between patterns with different topologies and limited generalization to garments with unseen topologies in the training data. In this work, we introduce GarmentImage, a unified raster-based sewing pattern representation. GarmentImage encodes a garment sewing pattern's geometry, topology and placement into multi-channel regular grids. Machine learning models trained on GarmentImage achieve seamless transitions between patterns with different topologies and show better generalization capabilities compared to models trained on vector-based representation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GarmentImage across three applications: pattern exploration in latent space, text-based pattern editing, and image-to-pattern prediction. The results show that GarmentImage achieves superior performance on these applications using only simple convolutional networks."
2505.04002,"Humans excel in navigating diverse, complex environments with agile motor skills, exemplified by parkour practitioners performing dynamic maneuvers, such as climbing up walls and jumping across gaps. Reproducing these agile movements with simulated characters remains challenging, in part due to the scarcity of motion capture data for agile terrain traversal behaviors and the high cost of acquiring such data. In this work, we introduce PARC (Physics-based Augmentation with Reinforcement Learning for Character Controllers), a framework that leverages machine learning and physics-based simulation to iteratively augment motion datasets and expand the capabilities of terrain traversal controllers. PARC begins by training a motion generator on a small dataset consisting of core terrain traversal skills. The motion generator is then used to produce synthetic data for traversing new terrains. However, these generated motions often exhibit artifacts, such as incorrect contacts or discontinuities. To correct these artifacts, we train a physics-based tracking controller to imitate the motions in simulation. The corrected motions are then added to the dataset, which is used to continue training the motion generator in the next iteration. PARC's iterative process jointly expands the capabilities of the motion generator and tracker, creating agile and versatile models for interacting with complex environments. PARC provides an effective approach to develop controllers for agile terrain traversal, which bridges the gap between the scarcity of motion data and the need for versatile character controllers."
2505.0405,"3D terrain models are essential in fields such as video game development and film production. Since surface color often correlates with terrain geometry, capturing this relationship is crucial to achieving realism. However, most existing methods generate either a heightmap or a texture, without sufficiently accounting for the inherent correlation. In this paper, we propose a method that jointly generates terrain heightmaps and textures using a latent diffusion model. First, we train the model in an unsupervised manner to randomly generate paired heightmaps and textures. Then, we perform supervised learning of an external adapter to enable user control via hand-drawn sketches. Experiments show that our approach allows intuitive terrain generation while preserving the correlation between heightmaps and textures."
2505.04051,"Three-dimensional building generation is vital for applications in gaming, virtual reality, and digital twins, yet current methods face challenges in producing diverse, structured, and hierarchically coherent buildings. We propose BuildingBlock, a hybrid approach that integrates generative models, procedural content generation (PCG), and large language models (LLMs) to address these limitations. Specifically, our method introduces a two-phase pipeline: the Layout Generation Phase (LGP) and the Building Construction Phase (BCP).LGP reframes box-based layout generation as a point-cloud generation task, utilizing a newly constructed architectural dataset and a Transformer-based diffusion model to create globally consistent layouts. With LLMs, these layouts are extended into rule-based hierarchical designs, seamlessly incorporating component styles and spatial structures.The BCP leverages these layouts to guide PCG, enabling local-customizable, high-quality structured building generation. Experimental results demonstrate BuildingBlock's effectiveness in generating diverse and hierarchically structured buildings, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, and paving the way for scalable and intuitive architectural workflows."
2505.04052,"Compositing human figures into scene images has broad applications in areas such as entertainment and advertising. However, existing methods often cannot handle occlusion of the inserted person by foreground objects and unnaturally place the person in the frontmost layer. Moreover, they offer limited control over the inserted person's pose. To address these challenges, we propose two methods. Both allow explicit pose control via a 3D body model and leverage latent diffusion models to synthesize the person at a contextually appropriate depth, naturally handling occlusions without requiring occlusion masks. The first is a two-stage approach: the model first learns a depth map of the scene with the person through supervised learning, and then synthesizes the person accordingly. The second method learns occlusion implicitly and synthesizes the person directly from input data without explicit depth supervision. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that both methods outperform existing approaches by better preserving scene consistency while accurately reflecting occlusions and user-specified poses."
2505.04203,"The art of instrument performance stands as a vivid manifestation of human creativity and emotion. Nonetheless, generating instrument performance motions is a highly challenging task, as it requires not only capturing intricate movements but also reconstructing the complex dynamics of the performer-instrument interaction. While existing works primarily focus on modeling partial body motions, we propose Expressive ceLlo performance motion Generation for Audio Rendition (ELGAR), a state-of-the-art diffusion-based framework for whole-body fine-grained instrument performance motion generation solely from audio. To emphasize the interactive nature of the instrument performance, we introduce Hand Interactive Contact Loss (HICL) and Bow Interactive Contact Loss (BICL), which effectively guarantee the authenticity of the interplay. Moreover, to better evaluate whether the generated motions align with the semantic context of the music audio, we design novel metrics specifically for string instrument performance motion generation, including finger-contact distance, bow-string distance, and bowing score. Extensive evaluations and ablation studies are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed methods. In addition, we put forward a motion generation dataset SPD-GEN, collated and normalized from the MoCap dataset SPD. As demonstrated, ELGAR has shown great potential in generating instrument performance motions with complicated and fast interactions, which will promote further development in areas such as animation, music education, interactive art creation, etc."
2505.04387,"Creating realistic 3D head assets for virtual characters that match a precise artistic vision remains labor-intensive. We present a novel framework that streamlines this process by providing artists with intuitive control over generated 3D heads. Our approach uses a geometry-aware texture synthesis pipeline that learns correlations between head geometry and skin texture maps across different demographics. The framework offers three levels of artistic control: manipulation of overall head geometry, adjustment of skin tone while preserving facial characteristics, and fine-grained editing of details such as wrinkles or facial hair. Our pipeline allows artists to make edits to a single texture map using familiar tools, with our system automatically propagating these changes coherently across the remaining texture maps needed for realistic rendering. Experiments demonstrate that our method produces diverse results with clean geometries. We showcase practical applications focusing on intuitive control for artists, including skin tone adjustments and simplified editing workflows for adding age-related details or removing unwanted features from scanned models. This integrated approach aims to streamline the artistic workflow in virtual character creation."
2505.0459,"We introduce TetWeave, a novel isosurface representation for gradient-based mesh optimization that jointly optimizes the placement of a tetrahedral grid used for Marching Tetrahedra and a novel directional signed distance at each point. TetWeave constructs tetrahedral grids on-the-fly via Delaunay triangulation, enabling increased flexibility compared to predefined grids. The extracted meshes are guaranteed to be watertight, two-manifold and intersection-free. The flexibility of TetWeave enables a resampling strategy that places new points where reconstruction error is high and allows to encourage mesh fairness without compromising on reconstruction error. This leads to high-quality, adaptive meshes that require minimal memory usage and few parameters to optimize. Consequently, TetWeave exhibits near-linear memory scaling relative to the vertex count of the output mesh - a substantial improvement over predefined grids. We demonstrate the applicability of TetWeave to a broad range of challenging tasks in computer graphics and vision, such as multi-view 3D reconstruction, mesh compression and geometric texture generation."
2505.04622,"Shape primitive abstraction, which decomposes complex 3D shapes into simple geometric elements, plays a crucial role in human visual cognition and has broad applications in computer vision and graphics. While recent advances in 3D content generation have shown remarkable progress, existing primitive abstraction methods either rely on geometric optimization with limited semantic understanding or learn from small-scale, category-specific datasets, struggling to generalize across diverse shape categories. We present PrimitiveAnything, a novel framework that reformulates shape primitive abstraction as a primitive assembly generation task. PrimitiveAnything includes a shape-conditioned primitive transformer for auto-regressive generation and an ambiguity-free parameterization scheme to represent multiple types of primitives in a unified manner. The proposed framework directly learns the process of primitive assembly from large-scale human-crafted abstractions, enabling it to capture how humans decompose complex shapes into primitive elements. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PrimitiveAnything can generate high-quality primitive assemblies that better align with human perception while maintaining geometric fidelity across diverse shape categories. It benefits various 3D applications and shows potential for enabling primitive-based user-generated content (UGC) in games. Project page:this https URL"
2505.04647,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in many vision tasks, yet understanding their internal behavior remains challenging, particularly how different layers and activation channels contribute to class separability. We introduce ChannelExplorer, an interactive visual analytics tool for analyzing image-based outputs across model layers, emphasizing data-driven insights over architecture analysis for exploring class separability. ChannelExplorer summarizes activations across layers and visualizes them using three primary coordinated views: a Scatterplot View to reveal inter- and intra-class confusion, a Jaccard Similarity View to quantify activation overlap, and a Heatmap View to inspect activation channel patterns. Our technique supports diverse model architectures, including CNNs, GANs, ResNet and Stable Diffusion models. We demonstrate the capabilities of ChannelExplorer through four use-case scenarios: (1) generating class hierarchy in ImageNet, (2) finding mislabeled images, (3) identifying activation channel contributions, and(4) locating latent states' position in Stable Diffusion model. Finally, we evaluate the tool with expert users."

Our results demonstrate that structured metadata enrichments greatly enhance visual realism, semantic fidelity, and model robustness across diverse text-to-image architectures.

2505.04656,"In this paper, we introduce MeshGen, an advanced image-to-3D pipeline that generates high-quality 3D meshes with detailed geometry and physically based rendering (PBR) textures. Addressing the challenges faced by existing 3D native diffusion models, such as suboptimal auto-encoder performance, limited controllability, poor generalization, and inconsistent image-based PBR texturing, MeshGen employs several key innovations to overcome these limitations. We pioneer a render-enhanced point-to-shape auto-encoder that compresses meshes into a compact latent space by designing perceptual optimization with ray-based regularization. This ensures that the 3D shapes are accurately represented and reconstructed to preserve geometric details within the latent space. To address data scarcity and image-shape misalignment, we further propose geometric augmentation and generative rendering augmentation techniques, which enhance the model's controllability and generalization ability, allowing it to perform well even with limited public datasets. For the texture generation, MeshGen employs a reference attention-based multi-view ControlNet for consistent appearance synthesis. This is further complemented by our multi-view PBR decomposer that estimates PBR components and a UV inpainter that fills invisible areas, ensuring a seamless and consistent texture across the 3D mesh. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MeshGen largely outperforms previous methods in both shape and texture generation, setting a new standard for the quality of 3D meshes generated with PBR textures.

2505.04659,"The semantic synthesis of unseen scenes from multiple viewpoints is crucial for research in 3D scene understanding. Current methods are capable of rendering novel-view images and semantic maps by reconstructing generalizable Neural Radiance Fields. However, they often suffer from limitations in speed and segmentation performance. We propose a generalizable semantic Gaussian Splatting method (GSsplat) for efficient novel-view synthesis. Our model predicts the positions and attributes of scene-adaptive Gaussian distributions from once input, replacing the densification and pruning processes of traditional scene-specific Gaussian Splatting. In the multi-task framework, a hybrid network is designed to extract color and semantic information and predict Gaussian parameters. To augment the spatial perception of Gaussians for high-quality rendering, we put forward a novel offset learning module through group-based supervision and a point-level interaction module with spatial unit aggregation. When evaluated with varying numbers of multi-view inputs, GSsplat achieves state-of-the-art performance for semantic synthesis at the fastest speed."
2505.04662,"Recently we have witnessed progress in hiding road vehicles against object detectors through adversarial camouflage in the digital world. The extension of this technique to the physical world is crucial for testing the robustness of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods do not show good performances when applied to the physical world. This is partly due to insufficient photorealism in training examples, and lack of proper physical realization methods for camouflage. To generate a robust adversarial camouflage suitable for real vehicles, we propose a novel method called PAV-Camou. We propose to adjust the mapping from the coordinates in the 2D map to those of corresponding 3D model. This process is critical for mitigating texture distortion and ensuring the camouflage's effectiveness when applied in the real world. Then we combine two renderers with different characteristics to obtain adversarial examples that are photorealistic that closely mimic real-world lighting and texture properties. The method ensures that the generated textures remain effective under diverse environmental conditions. Our adversarial camouflage can be optimized and printed in the form of 2D patterns, allowing for direct application on real vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed method achieved good performance in both the digital world and the physical world."
2505.04668,"Neural rendering techniques have made substantial progress in generating photo-realistic 3D scenes. The latest 3D Gaussian Splatting technique has achieved high quality novel view synthesis as well as fast rendering speed. However, 3D Gaussians lack proficiency in defining accurate 3D geometric structures despite their explicit primitive representations. This is due to the fact that Gaussian's attributes are primarily tailored and fine-tuned for rendering diverse 2D images by their anisotropic nature. To pave the way for efficient 3D reconstruction, we present Spherical Gaussians, a simple and effective representation for 3D geometric boundaries, from which we can directly reconstruct 3D feature curves from a set of calibrated multi-view images. Spherical Gaussians is optimized from grid initialization with a view-based rendering loss, where a 2D edge map is rendered at a specific view and then compared to the ground-truth edge map extracted from the corresponding image, without the need for any 3D guidance or supervision. Given Spherical Gaussians serve as intermedia for the robust edge representation, we further introduce a novel optimization-based algorithm called SGCR to directly extract accurate parametric curves from aligned Spherical Gaussians. We demonstrate that SGCR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in 3D edge reconstruction while enjoying great efficiency."
2505.04813,"In this work we present WIR3D, a technique for abstracting 3D shapes through a sparse set of visually meaningful curves in 3D. We optimize the parameters of Bezier curves such that they faithfully represent both the geometry and salient visual features (e.g. texture) of the shape from arbitrary viewpoints. We leverage the intermediate activations of a pre-trained foundation model (CLIP) to guide our optimization process. We divide our optimization into two phases: one for capturing the coarse geometry of the shape, and the other for representing fine-grained features. Our second phase supervision is spatially guided by a novel localized keypoint loss. This spatial guidance enables user control over abstracted features. We ensure fidelity to the original surface through a neural SDF loss, which allows the curves to be used as intuitive deformation handles. We successfully apply our method for shape abstraction over a broad dataset of shapes with varying complexity, geometric structure, and texture, and demonstrate downstream applications for feature control and shape deformation."
2505.04961,"Multi-objective optimization problems, which require the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives, are prevalent across numerous applications. Existing multi-objective optimization methods often rely on manually-tuned aggregation functions to formulate a joint optimization objective. The performance of such hand-tuned methods is heavily dependent on careful weight selection, a time-consuming and laborious process. These limitations also arise in the setting of reinforcement-learning-based motion tracking methods for physically simulated characters, where intricately crafted reward functions are typically used to achieve high-fidelity results. Such solutions not only require domain expertise and significant manual tuning, but also limit the applicability of the resulting reward function across diverse skills. To bridge this gap, we present a novel adversarial multi-objective optimization technique that is broadly applicable to a range of multi-objective reinforcement-learning tasks, including motion tracking. Our proposed Adversarial Differential Discriminator (ADD) receives a single positive sample, yet is still effective at guiding the optimization process. We demonstrate that our technique can enable characters to closely replicate a variety of acrobatic and agile behaviors, achieving comparable quality to state-of-the-art motion-tracking methods, without relying on manually-designed reward functions.

2505.04996,"Full-body gestures play a pivotal role in natural interactions and are crucial for achieving effective communication. Nevertheless, most existing studies primarily focus on the gesture generation of speakers, overlooking the vital role of listeners in the interaction process and failing to fully explore the dynamic interaction between them. This paper innovatively proposes an Inter-Diffusion Generation Model of Speakers and Listeners for Effective Communication. For the first time, we integrate the full-body gestures of listeners into the generation framework. By devising a novel inter-diffusion mechanism, this model can accurately capture the complex interaction patterns between speakers and listeners during communication. In the model construction process, based on the advanced diffusion model architecture, we innovatively introduce interaction conditions and the GAN model to increase the denoising step size. As a result, when generating gesture sequences, the model can not only dynamically generate based on the speaker's speech information but also respond in realtime to the listener's feedback, enabling synergistic interaction between the two. Abundant experimental results demonstrate that compared with the current state-of-the-art gesture generation methods, the model we proposed has achieved remarkable improvements in the naturalness, coherence, and speech-gesture synchronization of the generated gestures. In the subjective evaluation experiments, users highly praised the generated interaction scenarios, believing that they are closer to real life human communication situations. Objective index evaluations also show that our model outperforms the baseline methods in multiple key indicators, providing more powerful support for effective communication."
2505.0501,"By learning human motion priors, motion capture can be achieved by 6 inertial measurement units (IMUs) in recent years with the development of deep learning techniques, even though the sensor inputs are sparse and noisy. However, human global motions are still challenging to be reconstructed by IMUs. This paper aims to solve this problem by involving physics. It proposes a physical optimization scheme based on multiple contacts to enable physically plausible translation estimation in the full 3D space where the z-directional motion is usually challenging for previous works. It also considers gravity in local pose estimation which well constrains human global orientations and refines local pose estimation in a joint estimation manner. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves more accurate motion capture for both local poses and global motions. Furthermore, by deeply integrating physics, we can also estimate 3D contact, contact forces, joint torques, and interacting proxy surfaces."
2505.05132,"In this paper, we propose an active contour model for silhouette vectorization using cubic Bézier curves. Among the end points of the Bézier curves, we distinguish between corner and regular points where the orientation of the tangent vector is prescribed. By minimizing the distance of the Bézier curves to the silhouette boundary, the active contour model optimizes the location of the Bézier curves end points, the orientation of the tangent vectors in the regular points, and the estimation of the Bézier curve parameters. This active contour model can use the silhouette vectorization obtained by any method as an initial guess. The proposed method significantly reduces the average distance between the silhouette boundary and its vectorization obtained by the world-class graphic software Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, and a curvature-based vectorization method, which we introduce for comparison. Our method also allows us to impose additional regularity on the Bézier curves by reducing their lengths."
2505.05356,"We present a method to reconstruct dynamic scenes from monocular continuous-wave time-of-flight (C-ToF) cameras using raw sensor samples that achieves similar or better accuracy than neural volumetric approaches and is 100x faster. Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians. Experimental results show that our approach produces accurate reconstructions under constrained C-ToF sensing conditions, including for fast motions like swinging baseball bats.this https URL"
2505.06176,"Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs. Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp, Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals. Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In this paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them with a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing operations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles. Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit sequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we synthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits and then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize reasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by construction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and resolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a variety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and identity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural alternatives. Code, data, models, and supplementary results can be found via our project website atthis https URL."
2505.06227,"Rigging and skinning are essential steps to create realistic 3D animations, often requiring significant expertise and manual effort. Traditional attempts at automating these processes rely heavily on geometric heuristics and often struggle with objects of complex geometry. Recent data-driven approaches show potential for better generality, but are often constrained by limited training data. We present the Anymate Dataset, a large-scale dataset of 230K 3D assets paired with expert-crafted rigging and skinning information -- 70 times larger than existing datasets. Using this dataset, we propose a learning-based auto-rigging framework with three sequential modules for joint, connectivity, and skinning weight prediction. We systematically design and experiment with various architectures as baselines for each module and conduct comprehensive evaluations on our dataset to compare their performance. Our models significantly outperform existing methods, providing a foundation for comparing future methods in automated rigging and skinning. Code and dataset can be found atthis https URL."
2505.06523,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables the reconstruction of intricate digital 3D assets from multi-view images by leveraging a set of 3D Gaussian primitives for rendering. Its explicit and discrete representation facilitates the seamless composition of complex digital worlds, offering significant advantages over previous neural implicit methods. However, when applied to large-scale compositions, such as crowd-level scenes, it can encompass numerous 3D Gaussians, posing substantial challenges for real-time rendering. To address this, inspired by Unreal Engine 5's Nanite system, we propose Virtualized 3D Gaussians (V3DG), a cluster-based LOD solution that constructs hierarchical 3D Gaussian clusters and dynamically selects only the necessary ones to accelerate rendering speed. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) Offline Build, where hierarchical clusters are generated using a local splatting method to minimize visual differences across granularities, and (2) Online Selection, where footprint evaluation determines perceptible clusters for efficient rasterization during rendering. We curate a dataset of synthetic and real-world scenes, including objects, trees, people, and buildings, each requiring 0.1 billion 3D Gaussians to capture fine details. Experiments show that our solution balances rendering efficiency and visual quality across user-defined tolerances, facilitating downstream interactive applications that compose extensive 3DGS assets for consistent rendering performance."
2505.06582,"State-of-the-art neural rendering methods optimize Gaussian scene representations from a few photographs for novel-view synthesis. Building on these representations, we develop an efficient algorithm, dubbed Gaussian Wave Splatting, to turn these Gaussians into holograms. Unlike existing computer-generated holography (CGH) algorithms, Gaussian Wave Splatting supports accurate occlusions and view-dependent effects for photorealistic scenes by leveraging recent advances in neural rendering. Specifically, we derive a closed-form solution for a 2D Gaussian-to-hologram transform that supports occlusions and alpha blending. Inspired by classic computer graphics techniques, we also derive an efficient approximation of the aforementioned process in the Fourier domain that is easily parallelizable and implement it using custom CUDA kernels. By integrating emerging neural rendering pipelines with holographic display technology, our Gaussian-based CGH framework paves the way for next-generation holographic displays."
2505.06703,"Skeletal animations of large-scale characters are widely used in video games. However, with a large number of characters are involved, relying on the CPU to calculate skeletal animations leads to significant performance problems. There are two main types of traditional GPU- based solutions. One is referred to as pre-baked animation texture technology. The problem with this solution is that it can only play animations from the pre-baked animation. It is impossible to perform interpolation, blending and other calculations on the animation, which affects the quality of the animations. The other solution is referred to as dedicated processing with a simple skeleton hierarchy (the number of skeleton levels < 64). This option does not need to simulate and bake animation data in advance. However, performance is dramatically impaired when processing complex skeletons with too many skeleton levels (such as fluttering clothing, soft plants, dragon-like creatures, etc.). In order to solve these issues, we developed a parallel prefix tree update solution to optimize the animation update process of complex skeletons with too many levels, and combined traditional solutions to implement a GPU-based skeletal animation solution. This solution does not need to simulate and bake animation results. In addition, the performance is superior to traditional solutions for complex skeletons with too many levels. Our work can provide a new option for optimizing the performance of large-scale skeletal animation simulations, providing GPU-based skeletal animations a wider range of application scenarios."
2505.07843,"In poster design, content-aware layout generation is crucial for automatically arranging visual-textual elements on the given image. With limited training data, existing work focused on image-centric enhancement. However, this neglects the diversity of layouts and fails to cope with shape-variant elements or diverse design intents in generalized settings. To this end, we proposed a layout-centric approach that leverages layout knowledge implicit in large language models (LLMs) to create posters for omnifarious purposes, hence the name PosterO. Specifically, it structures layouts from datasets as trees in SVG language by universal shape, design intent vectorization, and hierarchical node representation. Then, it applies LLMs during inference to predict new layout trees by in-context learning with intent-aligned example selection. After layout trees are generated, we can seamlessly realize them into poster designs by editing the chat with LLMs. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that PosterO can generate visually appealing layouts for given images, achieving new state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks. To further explore PosterO's abilities under the generalized settings, we built PStylish7, the first dataset with multi-purpose posters and various-shaped elements, further offering a challenging test for advanced research."
2505.07887,"We propose an online 3D Gaussian-based dense mapping framework for photorealistic details reconstruction from a monocular image stream. Our approach addresses two key challenges in monocular online reconstruction: distributing Gaussians without relying on depth maps and ensuring both local and global consistency in the reconstructed maps. To achieve this, we introduce two key modules: the Hierarchical Gaussian Management Module for effective Gaussian distribution and the Global Consistency Optimization Module for maintaining alignment and coherence at all scales. In addition, we present the Multi-level Occupancy Hash Voxels (MOHV), a structure that regularizes Gaussians for capturing details across multiple levels of granularity. MOHV ensures accurate reconstruction of both fine and coarse geometries and textures, preserving intricate details while maintaining overall structural integrity. Compared to state-of-the-art RGB-only and even RGB-D methods, our framework achieves superior reconstruction quality with high computational efficiency. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly with various tracking systems, ensuring generality and scalability."
2505.08239,"We introduce the simple idea of adaptive view planning to multi-view synthesis, aiming to improve both occlusion revelation and 3D consistency for single-view 3D reconstruction. Instead of producing an unordered set of views independently or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal consistency to enhance 3D coherence. More importantly, our view sequence is not determined by a pre-determined and fixed camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive camera trajectory (ACT), forming an orbit, which seeks to maximize the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion model to generate novel views around the orbit, which can then be passed to any multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final result. Our multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying pre-trained models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA alternatives on the unseen GSO dataset."
2505.08293,"Generating full-body human gestures encompassing face, body, hands, and global movements from audio is a valuable yet challenging task in virtual avatar creation. Previous systems focused on tokenizing the human gestures framewisely and predicting the tokens of each frame from the input audio. However, one observation is that the number of frames required for a complete expressive human gesture, defined as granularity, varies among different human gesture patterns. Existing systems fail to model these gesture patterns due to the fixed granularity of their gesture tokens. To solve this problem, we propose a novel framework named Multi-Granular Gesture Generator (M3G) for audio-driven holistic gesture generation. In M3G, we propose a novel Multi-Granular VQ-VAE (MGVQ-VAE) to tokenize motion patterns and reconstruct motion sequences from different temporal granularities. Subsequently, we proposed a multi-granular token predictor that extracts multi-granular information from audio and predicts the corresponding motion tokens. Then M3G reconstructs the human gestures from the predicted tokens using the MGVQ-VAE. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our proposed M3G framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of generating natural and expressive full-body human gestures."
2505.08666,"This paper introduces Claycode, a novel 2D scannable code designed for extensive stylization and deformation. Unlike traditional matrix-based codes (e.g., QR codes), Claycodes encode their message in a tree structure. During the encoding process, bits are mapped into a topology tree, which is then depicted as a nesting of color regions drawn within the boundaries of a target polygon shape. When decoding, Claycodes are extracted and interpreted in real-time from a camera stream. We detail the end-to-end pipeline and show that Claycodes allow for extensive stylization without compromising their functionality. We then empirically demonstrate Claycode's high tolerance to heavy deformations, outperforming traditional 2D scannable codes in scenarios where they typically fail."
2505.08686,"Computer-aided design (CAD) is a way to digitally create 2D drawings and 3D models of real-world products. Traditional CAD typically relies on hand-drawing by experts or modifications of existing library files, which doesn't allow for rapid personalization. With the emergence of generative artificial intelligence, convenient and efficient personalized CAD generation has become possible. However, existing generative methods typically produce outputs that lack interactive editability and geometric annotations, limiting their practical applications in manufacturing. To enable interactive generative CAD, we propose CAD-Coder, a framework that transforms natural language instructions into CAD script codes, which can be executed in Python environments to generate human-editable CAD files (.Dxf). To facilitate the generation of editable CAD sketches with annotation information, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising 29,130 Dxf files with their corresponding script codes, where each sketch preserves both editability and geometric annotations. We evaluate CAD-Coder on various 2D/3D CAD generation tasks against existing methods, demonstrating superior interactive capabilities while uniquely providing editable sketches with geometric annotations."
2505.08889,"Generative diffusion models have advanced image editing with high-quality results and intuitive interfaces such as prompts and semantic drawing. However, these interfaces lack precise control, and the associated methods typically specialize on a single editing task.

Building atop the RGB-X diffusion framework, we address key challenges of identity preservation and intrinsic-channel entanglement. By incorporating exact diffusion inversion and disentangled channel manipulation, we enable precise, efficient editing with automatic resolution of global illumination effects -- all without additional data collection or model fine-tuning. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks on complex images, including color and texture adjustments, object insertion and removal, global relighting, and their combinations."
2505.08919,"High-quality 3D reconstruction of pulmonary segments plays a crucial role in segmentectomy and surgical treatment planning for lung cancer. Due to the resolution requirement of the target reconstruction, conventional deep learning-based methods often suffer from computational resource constraints or limited granularity. Conversely, implicit modeling is favored due to its computational efficiency and continuous representation at any resolution. We propose a neural implicit function-based method to learn a 3D surface to achieve anatomy-aware, precise pulmonary segment reconstruction, represented as a shape by deforming a learnable template. Additionally, we introduce two clinically relevant evaluation metrics to assess the reconstruction comprehensively. Further, due to the absence of publicly available shape datasets to benchmark reconstruction algorithms, we developed a shape dataset named Lung3D, including the 3D models of 800 labeled pulmonary segments and the corresponding airways, arteries, veins, and intersegmental veins. We demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, providing a new perspective for pulmonary segment reconstruction. Code and data will be available atthis https URL."
2505.08985,"Detailed microstructures on specular objects often exhibit intriguing glinty patterns under high-frequency lighting, which is challenging to render using a conventional normal-mapped BRDF. In this paper, we present a manifold-based formulation of the glint normal distribution functions (NDF) that precisely captures the surface normal distributions over queried footprints. The manifold-based formulation transfers the integration for the glint NDF construction to a problem of mesh intersections. Compared to previous works that rely on complex numerical approximations, our integral solution is exact and much simpler to compute, which also allows an easy adaptation of a mesh clustering hierarchy to accelerate the NDF evaluation of large footprints. Our performance and quality analysis shows that our NDF formulation achieves similar glinty appearance compared to the baselines but is an order of magnitude faster. Within this framework, we further present a novel derivation of analytical shadow-masking for normal-mapped diffuse surfaces -- a component that is often ignored in previous works."
2505.08998,"Neural bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) have emerged as popular material representations for enhancing realism in physically-based rendering. Yet their importance sampling remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a reparameterization-based formulation of neural BRDF importance sampling that seamlessly integrates into the standard rendering pipeline with precise generation of BRDF samples. The reparameterization-based formulation transfers the distribution learning task to a problem of identifying BRDF integral substitutions. In contrast to previous methods that rely on invertible networks and multi-step inference to reconstruct BRDF distributions, our model removes these constraints, which offers greater flexibility and efficiency. Our variance and performance analysis demonstrates that our reparameterization method achieves the best variance reduction in neural BRDF renderings while maintaining high inference speeds compared to existing baselines."
2505.0935,"In computer games, traditional procedural terrain generation relies on a grid of vertices, with each point representing terrain elevation. For each square in the grid, two triangles are created by connecting fixed vertex indices, resulting in a continuous 3D surface. While this method is efficient for modelling smooth terrain, the grid-like structure lacks the distinct, chaotic appearance of low-poly objects and is not suitable to be used for our purposes. The technique presented in this paper aims to solve the following problem: Generate random, low-poly looking terraced terrain with different biomes and add vegetation to create an interesting environment."
2505.09393,"Sparse wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) have gained popularity for estimating 3D human motion. However, challenges such as pose ambiguity, data drift, and limited adaptability to diverse bodies persist. To address these issues, we propose UMotion, an uncertainty-driven, online fusing-all state estimation framework for 3D human shape and pose estimation, supported by six integrated, body-worn ultra-wideband (UWB) distance sensors with IMUs. UWB sensors measure inter-node distances to infer spatial relationships, aiding in resolving pose ambiguities and body shape variations when combined with anthropometric data. Unfortunately, IMUs are prone to drift, and UWB sensors are affected by body occlusions. Consequently, we develop a tightly coupled Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) framework that fuses uncertainties from sensor data and estimated human motion based on individual body shape. The UKF iteratively refines IMU and UWB measurements by aligning them with uncertain human motion constraints in real-time, producing optimal estimates for each. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of UMotion in stabilizing sensor data and the improvement over state of the art in pose accuracy."
2505.10144,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly become a leading technique for novel-view synthesis, providing exceptional performance through efficient software-based GPU rasterization. Its versatility enables real-time applications, including on mobile and lower-powered devices. However, 3DGS faces key challenges in virtual reality (VR): (1) temporal artifacts, such as popping during head movements, (2) projection-based distortions that result in disturbing and view-inconsistent floaters, and (3) reduced framerates when rendering large numbers of Gaussians, falling below the critical threshold for VR. Compared to desktop environments, these issues are drastically amplified by large field-of-view, constant head movements, and high resolution of head-mounted displays (HMDs). In this work, we introduce VRSplat: we combine and extend several recent advancements in 3DGS to address challenges of VR holistically. We show how the ideas of Mini-Splatting, StopThePop, and Optimal Projection can complement each other, by modifying the individual techniques and core 3DGS rasterizer. Additionally, we propose an efficient foveated rasterizer that handles focus and peripheral areas in a single GPU launch, avoiding redundant computations and improving GPU utilization. Our method also incorporates a fine-tuning step that optimizes Gaussian parameters based on StopThePop depth evaluations and Optimal Projection. We validate our method through a controlled user study with 25 participants, showing a strong preference for VRSplat over other configurations of Mini-Splatting. VRSplat is the first, systematically evaluated 3DGS approach capable of supporting modern VR applications, achieving 72+ FPS while eliminating popping and stereo-disrupting floaters."
2505.10558,"Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their resolution independence and well-organized layer structure. Although existing text-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they often overlook an important need in practical applications: style customization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics with consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics. Extending existing T2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges. Optimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I) models for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity. On the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity, yet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to limited SVG training data.To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward T2V models and T2I image priors. In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities. In the second stage, we customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized T2I models. By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an efficient feed-forward manner. The effectiveness of our method has been validated through extensive experiments. The project page isthis https URL."
2505.10576,"High-fidelity hand gesture generation represents a significant challenge in human-centric generation tasks. Existing methods typically employ a single-view mesh-rendered image prior to enhancing gesture generation quality. However, the spatial complexity of hand gestures and the inherent limitations of single-view rendering make it difficult to capture complete gesture information, particularly when fingers are occluded. The fundamental contradiction lies in the loss of 3D topological relationships through 2D projection and the incomplete spatial coverage inherent to single-view representations. Diverging from single-view prior approaches, we propose a multi-view prior framework, named Multi-Modal UNet-based Feature Encoder (MUFEN), to guide diffusion models in learning comprehensive 3D hand information. Specifically, we extend conventional front-view rendering to include rear, left, right, top, and bottom perspectives, selecting the most information-rich view combination as training priors to address occlusion. This multi-view prior with a dedicated dual stream encoder significantly improves the model's understanding of complete hand features. Furthermore, we design a bounding box feature fusion module, which can fuse the gesture localization features and multi-modal features to enhance the location-awareness of the MUFEN features to the gesture-related features. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations. The source code is available atthis https URL."
2505.10824,"Textured mesh quality assessment (TMQA) is critical for various 3D mesh applications. However, existing TMQA methods often struggle to provide accurate and robust evaluations. Motivated by the effectiveness of fields in representing both 3D geometry and color information, we propose a novel point-based TMQA method called field mesh quality metric (FMQM). FMQM utilizes signed distance fields and a newly proposed color field named nearest surface point color field to realize effective mesh feature description. Four features related to visual perception are extracted from the geometry and color fields: geometry similarity, geometry gradient similarity, space color distribution similarity, and space color gradient similarity. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that FMQM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) TMQA metrics. Furthermore, FMQM exhibits low computational complexity, making it a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications in 3D graphics and visualization.

Our method uses a neural network to predict the light selection distribution at each shading point based on local information, trained by minimizing the KL-divergence between the learned and target distributions in an online manner. To efficiently manage hundreds or thousands of lights, we integrate our neural approach with light hierarchy techniques, where the network predicts cluster-level distributions and existing methods sample lights within clusters. Additionally, we introduce a residual learning strategy that leverages initial distributions from existing techniques, accelerating convergence during training.

2505.12373,"Human aesthetic preferences for 3D shapes are central to industrial design, virtual reality, and consumer product development. However, most computational models of 3D aesthetics lack empirical grounding in large-scale human judgments, limiting their practical relevance. We present a large-scale study of human preferences. We collected 22,301 pairwise comparisons across five object categories (chairs, tables, mugs, lamps, and dining chairs) via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Building on a previously published dataset~\cite{dev2020learning}, we introduce new non-linear modeling and cross-category analysis to uncover the geometric drivers of aesthetic preference. We apply the Bradley-Terry model to infer latent aesthetic scores and use Random Forests with SHAP analysis to identify and interpret the most influential geometric features (e.g., symmetry, curvature, compactness). Our cross-category analysis reveals both universal principles and domain-specific trends in aesthetic preferences. We focus on human interpretable geometric features to ensure model transparency and actionable design insights, rather than relying on black-box deep learning approaches. Our findings bridge computational aesthetics and cognitive science, providing practical guidance for designers and a publicly available dataset to support reproducibility. This work advances the understanding of 3D shape aesthetics through a human-centric, data-driven framework."
2505.12539,"We introduce a novel approach to simulate the interaction between fluids and thin elastic solids without any penetration. Our approach is centered around an optimization system augmented with barriers, which aims to find a configuration that ensures the absence of penetration while enforcing incompressibility for the fluids and minimizing elastic potentials for the solids. Unlike previous methods that primarily focus on velocity coherence at the fluid-solid interfaces, we demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of explicitly resolving positional constraints, including both explicit representation of solid positions and the implicit representation of fluid level-set interface. To preserve the volume of the fluid, we propose a simple yet efficient approach that adjusts the associated level-set values. Additionally, we develop a distance metric capable of measuring the separation between an implicitly represented surface and a Lagrangian object of arbitrary codimension. By integrating the inertia, solid elastic potential, damping, barrier potential, and fluid incompressibility within a unified system, we are able to robustly simulate a wide range of processes involving fluid interactions with lower-dimensional objects such as shells and rods. These processes include topology changes, bouncing, splashing, sliding, rolling, floating, and more."
2505.12619,"Recent data-driven methods leveraging deep reinforcement learning have been an effective paradigm for developing controllers that enable physically simulated characters to produce natural human-like behaviors. However, these data-driven methods often struggle to adapt to novel environments and compose diverse skills coherently to perform more complex tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid imitation learning (HIL) framework that combines motion tracking, for precise skill replication, with adversarial imitation learning, to enhance adaptability and skill composition. This hybrid learning framework is implemented through parallel multi-task environments and a unified observation space, featuring an agent-centric scene representation to facilitate effective learning from the hybrid parallel environments. Our framework trains a unified controller on parkour data sourced from Internet videos, enabling a simulated character to traverse through new environments using diverse and life-like parkour skills. Evaluations across challenging parkour environments demonstrate that our method improves motion quality, increases skill diversity, and achieves competitive task completion compared to previous learning-based methods."
2505.12774,"Human motion synthesis in complex scenes presents a fundamental challenge, extending beyond conventional Text-to-Motion tasks by requiring the integration of diverse modalities such as static environments, movable objects, natural language prompts, and spatial waypoints. Existing language-conditioned motion models often struggle with scene-aware motion generation due to limitations in motion tokenization, which leads to information loss and fails to capture the continuous, context-dependent nature of 3D human movement. To address these issues, we propose UniHM, a unified motion language model that leverages diffusion-based generation for synthesizing scene-aware human motion. UniHM is the first framework to support both Text-to-Motion and Text-to-Human-Object Interaction (HOI) in complex 3D scenes. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a mixed-motion representation that fuses continuous 6DoF motion with discrete local motion tokens to improve motion realism; (2) a novel Look-Up-Free Quantization VAE (LFQ-VAE) that surpasses traditional VQ-VAEs in both reconstruction accuracy and generative performance; and (3) an enriched version of the Lingo dataset augmented with HumanML3D annotations, providing stronger supervision for scene-specific motion learning. Experimental results demonstrate that UniHM achieves comparative performance on the OMOMO benchmark for text-to-HOI synthesis and yields competitive results on HumanML3D for general text-conditioned motion generation."
2505.12782,"Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have become a pivotal research focus in deep learning, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D LMMs employing thousands of spatial tokens for multimodal reasoning suffer from critical inefficiencies: excessive computational overhead and redundant information flows. Unlike 2D VLMs processing single images, 3D LMMs exhibit inherent architectural redundancy due to the heterogeneous mechanisms between spatial tokens and visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose AdaToken-3D, an adaptive spatial token optimization framework that dynamically prunes redundant tokens through spatial contribution analysis. Our method automatically tailors pruning strategies to different 3D LMM architectures by quantifying token-level information flows via attention pattern mining. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-3D (a 7B parameter 3D-LMM) demonstrate that AdaToken-3D achieves 21\% faster inference speed and 63\% FLOPs reduction while maintaining original task accuracy. Beyond efficiency gains, this work systematically investigates redundancy patterns in multimodal spatial information flows through quantitative token interaction analysis. Our findings reveal that over 60\% of spatial tokens contribute minimally ($<$5\%) to the final predictions, establishing theoretical foundations for efficient 3D multimodal learning."
2505.1339,"We introduce a novel Unsmoothed Aggregation (UA) Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) method combined with Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) to overcome the limitations of Extended Position-Based Dynamics (XPBD) in high-resolution and high-stiffness simulations. While XPBD excels in simulating deformable objects due to its speed and simplicity, its nonlinear Gauss-Seidel (GS) solver often struggles with low-frequency errors, leading to instability and stalling issues, especially in high-resolution, high-stiffness simulations. Our multigrid approach addresses these issues efficiently by leveraging AMG. To reduce the computational overhead of traditional AMG, where prolongator construction can consume up to two-thirds of the runtime, we propose a lazy setup strategy that reuses prolongators across iterations based on matrix structure and physical significance. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified method for constructing near-kernel components by applying a few sweeps of iterative methods to the homogeneous equation, achieving convergence rates comparable to adaptive smoothed aggregation (adaptive-SA) at a lower computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves convergence rates and numerical stability, enabling efficient and stable high-resolution simulations of deformable objects."
2505.13573,"The next-coordinate prediction paradigm has emerged as the de facto standard in current auto-regressive mesh generation methods. Despite their effectiveness, there is no efficient measurement for the various tokenizers that serialize meshes into sequences. In this paper, we introduce a new metric Per-Token-Mesh-Entropy (PTME) to evaluate the existing mesh tokenizers theoretically without any training. Building upon PTME, we propose a plug-and-play tokenization technique called coordinate merging. It further improves the compression ratios of existing tokenizers by rearranging and merging the most frequent patterns of coordinates. Through experiments on various tokenization methods like MeshXL, MeshAnything V2, and Edgerunner, we further validate the performance of our method. We hope that the proposed PTME and coordinate merging can enhance the existing mesh tokenizers and guide the further development of native mesh generation."
2505.14087,"Generating large-scale multi-character interactions is a challenging and important task in character animation. Multi-character interactions involve not only natural interactive motions but also characters coordinated with each other for transition. For example, a dance scenario involves characters dancing with partners and also characters coordinated to new partners based on spatial and temporal observations. We term such transitions as coordinated interactions and decompose them into interaction synthesis and transition planning. Previous methods of single-character animation do not consider interactions that are critical for multiple characters. Deep-learning-based interaction synthesis usually focuses on two characters and does not consider transition planning. Optimization-based interaction synthesis relies on manually designing objective functions that may not generalize well. While crowd simulation involves more characters, their interactions are sparse and passive. We identify two challenges to multi-character interaction synthesis, including the lack of data and the planning of transitions among close and dense interactions. Existing datasets either do not have multiple characters or do not have close and dense interactions. The planning of transitions for multi-character close and dense interactions needs both spatial and temporal considerations. We propose a conditional generative pipeline comprising a coordinatable multi-character interaction space for interaction synthesis and a transition planning network for coordinations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline for multicharacter interaction synthesis and the applications facilitated by our method show the scalability and transferability."
2505.14306,"CVT (Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation)-based remeshing optimizes mesh quality by leveraging the Voronoi-Delaunay framework to optimize vertex distribution and produce uniformly distributed vertices with regular triangles. Current CVT-based approaches can be classified into two categories: (1) exact methods (e.g., Geodesic CVT, Restricted Voronoi Diagrams) that ensure high quality but require significant computation; and (2) approximate methods that try to reduce computational complexity yet result in fair quality. To address this trade-off, we propose a CVT-based surface remeshing approach that achieves balanced optimization between quality and efficiency through multiple clipping times of 3D Centroidal Voronoi cells with curvature-adaptive original surface facets. The core idea of the method is that we adaptively adjust the number of clipping times according to local curvature, and use the angular relationship between the normal vectors of neighboring facets to represent the magnitude of local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
2505.14732,We use the $p$-Laplacian with large $p$-values in order to approximate geodesic distances to features on surfaces. This differs from Fayolle and Belyaev's (2018) [1] computational results using the $p$-Laplacian for the distance-to-surface problem. Our approach appears to offer some distinct advantages over other popular PDE-based distance function approximation methods. We employ a surface finite element scheme and demonstrate numerical convergence to the true geodesic distance functions. We check that our numerical results adhere to the triangle inequality and examine robustness against geometric noise such as vertex perturbations. We also present comparisons of our method with the heat method from Crane et al. [2] and the classical polyhedral method from Mitchell et al. [3].
2505.1519,"The advances in 3D reconstruction technology, such as photogrammetry and LiDAR scanning, have made it easier to reconstruct accurate and detailed 3D models for urban scenes. Nevertheless, these reconstructed models often contain a large number of geometry primitives, making interactive manipulation and rendering challenging, especially on resource-constrained devices like virtual reality platforms. Therefore, the generation of appropriate levels-of-detail (LOD) representations for these models is crucial. Additionally, automatically reconstructed 3D models tend to suffer from noise and lack semantic information. Dealing with these issues and creating LOD representations that are robust against noise while capturing the semantic meaning present significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to address these challenges. We begin by analysing the properties of planar primitives detected from the input and group these primitives into multiple level sets by forming meaningful 3D structures. These level sets form the nodes of our innovative LOD-Tree. By selecting nodes at appropriate depths within the LOD-Tree, different LOD representations can be generated. Experimental results on real and complex urban scenes demonstrate the merits of our approach in generating clean, accurate, and semantically meaningful LOD representations."
2505.16397,"This paper presents a method for generating dynamic caustic patterns by utilising dual-optimised holographic fields with Phased Array Transducer (PAT). Building on previous research in static caustic optimisation and ultrasonic manipulation, this approach employs computational techniques to dynamically shape fluid surfaces, thereby creating controllable and real-time caustic images. The system employs a Digital Twin framework, which enables iterative feedback and refinement, thereby improving the accuracy and quality of the caustic patterns produced. This paper extends the foundational work in caustic generation by integrating liquid surfaces as refractive media. This concept has previously been explored in simulations but not fully realised in practical applications. The utilisation of ultrasound to directly manipulate these surfaces enables the generation of dynamic caustics with a high degree of flexibility. The Digital Twin approach further enhances this process by allowing for precise adjustments and optimisation based on real-time feedback. Experimental results demonstrate the technique's capacity to generate continuous animations and complex caustic patterns at high frequencies. Although there are limitations in contrast and resolution compared to solid-surface methods, this approach offers advantages in terms of real-time adaptability and scalability. This technique has the potential to be applied in a number of areas, including interactive displays, artistic installations and educational tools. This research builds upon the work of previous researchers in the fields of caustics optimisation, ultrasonic manipulation, and computational displays. Future research will concentrate on enhancing the resolution and intricacy of the generated patterns."
2505.16951,"Photogrammetry is transforming digital content creation by enabling the rapid conversion of real-world objects into highly detailed 3D models. This paper evaluates the role of RealityCapture, a GPU-accelerated photogrammetry tool, in game development of Virtual Reality (VR). We assess its efficiency, reconstruction accuracy, and integration with Unreal Engine, comparing its advantages and limitations against traditional modeling workflows. Additionally, we examined user preferences between designed 3D assets and photogrammetry-generated models. The results revealed that while photogrammetry enhances realism and interactivity, users slightly preferred manually designed models for small, manipulable elements because of the level of detail. However, from a developer perspective, RealityCapture significantly reduces development time while maintaining geometric precision and photorealistic textures. Despite its reliance on high-performance hardware, its automation, scalability, and seamless integration with real-time rendering engines make it a valuable tool for game developers and VR creators. Future improvements in AI-driven optimization and cloud-based processing could enhance accessibility, broadening its applications in gaming, cultural heritage preservation, and simulation."
2505.17402,"High-fidelity 3D reconstruction is critical for aerial inspection tasks such as infrastructure monitoring, structural assessment, and environmental surveying. While traditional photogrammetry techniques enable geometric modeling, they lack semantic interpretability, limiting their effectiveness for automated inspection workflows. Recent advances in neural rendering and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer efficient, photorealistic reconstructions but similarly lack scene-level understanding.In this work, we present a UAV-based pipeline that extends Feature-3DGS for language-guided 3D segmentation. We leverage LSeg-based feature fields with CLIP embeddings to generate heatmaps in response to language prompts. These are thresholded to produce rough segmentations, and the highest-scoring point is then used as a prompt to SAM or SAM2 for refined 2D segmentation on novel view renderings. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of various feature field backbones (CLIP-LSeg, SAM, SAM2) in capturing meaningful structure in large-scale outdoor environments. We demonstrate that this hybrid approach enables flexible, language-driven interaction with photorealistic 3D reconstructions, opening new possibilities for semantic aerial inspection and scene understanding."
2505.1786,"Generating realistic human motion with high-level controls is a crucial task for social understanding, robotics, and animation. With high-quality MOCAP data becoming more available recently, a wide range of data-driven approaches have been presented. However, modelling multi-person interactions still remains a less explored area. In this paper, we present Graph-driven Interaction Sampling, a method that can generate realistic and diverse multi-person interactions by leveraging existing two-person motion diffusion models as motion priors. Instead of training a new model specific to multi-person interaction synthesis, our key insight is to spatially and temporally separate complex multi-person interactions into a graph structure of two-person interactions, which we name the Pairwise Interaction Graph. We thus decompose the generation task into simultaneous single-person motion generation conditioned on one other's motion. In addition, to reduce artifacts such as interpenetrations of body parts in generated multi-person interactions, we introduce two graph-dependent guidance terms into the diffusion sampling scheme. Unlike previous work, our method can produce various high-quality multi-person interactions without having repetitive individual motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in reducing artifacts when generating a wide range of two-person and multi-person interactions."
2505.18075,"Laser scanning microscopy enables the acquisition of 3D data in biomedical research. A fundamental challenge in visualizing 3D data is that common flat-panel displays, being 2D in nature, cannot faithfully reproduce light fields. Recent years have witnessed the development of various 3D display technologies. These technologies generally fall into two categories, stereography and holography, depending on the number of perspectives they can simultaneously present. We have integrated support for many commercially available 3D-capable displays into FluoRender, a visualization and analysis system for fluorescence microscopy data. This study investigates the opportunities and challenges of applying various 3D display devices in biological research, focusing on their practical use and potential for broad adoption. We found that 3D display devices, including the HoloLens and the Looking Glass, each have their merits and shortcomings. We predict that the convergence of stereographic and holographic technologies will create powerful tools for visualization and analysis in biological applications."
2505.18151,"WonderPlay is a novel framework integrating physics simulation with video generation for generating action-conditioned dynamic 3D scenes from a single image. While prior works are restricted to rigid body or simple elastic dynamics, WonderPlay features a hybrid generative simulator to synthesize a wide range of 3D dynamics. The hybrid generative simulator first uses a physics solver to simulate coarse 3D dynamics, which subsequently conditions a video generator to produce a video with finer, more realistic motion. The generated video is then used to update the simulated dynamic 3D scene, closing the loop between the physics solver and the video generator. This approach enables intuitive user control to be combined with the accurate dynamics of physics-based simulators and the expressivity of diffusion-based video generators. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderPlay enables users to interact with various scenes of diverse content, including cloth, sand, snow, liquid, smoke, elastic, and rigid bodies -- all using a single image input. Code will be made public. Project website:this https URL"
2505.18197,"Recently, immersive media and autonomous driving applications have significantly advanced through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which offers high-fidelity rendering and computational efficiency. Despite these advantages, 3DGS as a display-oriented representation requires substantial storage due to its numerous Gaussian attributes. Current compression methods have shown promising results but typically neglect the compression of Gaussian spatial positions, creating unnecessary bitstream overhead. We conceptualize Gaussian primitives as point clouds and propose leveraging point cloud compression techniques for more effective storage. AI-based point cloud compression demonstrates superior performance and faster inference compared to MPEG Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC). However, direct application of existing models to Gaussian compression may yield suboptimal results, as Gaussian point clouds tend to exhibit globally sparse yet locally dense geometric distributions that differ from conventional point cloud characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce GausPcgc for Gaussian point cloud geometry compression along with a specialized training dataset GausPcc-1K. Our work pioneers the integration of AI-based point cloud compression into Gaussian compression pipelines, achieving superior compression ratios. The framework complements existing Gaussian compression methods while delivering significant performance improvements. All code, data, and pre-trained models will be publicly released to facilitate further research advances in this field."
2505.18764,"Recent works demonstrate the advantages of hardware rasterization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in forward-pass rendering through fast GPU-optimized graphics and fixed memory footprint. However, extending these benefits to backward-pass gradient computation remains challenging due to graphics pipeline constraints. We present a differentiable hardware rasterizer for 3DGS that overcomes the memory and performance limitations of tile-based software rasterization. Our solution employs programmable blending for per-pixel gradient computation combined with a hybrid gradient reduction strategy (quad-level + subgroup) in fragment shaders, achieving over 10x faster backward rasterization versus naive atomic operations and 3x speedup over the canonical tile-based rasterizer. Systematic evaluation reveals 16-bit render targets (float16 and unorm16) as the optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off, achieving higher gradient accuracy among mixed-precision rendering formats with execution speeds second only to unorm8, while float32 texture incurs severe forward pass performance degradation due to suboptimal hardware optimizations. Our method with float16 formats demonstrates 3.07x acceleration in full pipeline execution (forward + backward passes) on RTX4080 GPUs with the MipNeRF 360 dataset, outperforming the baseline tile-based renderer while preserving hardware rasterization's memory efficiency advantages -- incurring merely 2.67% of the memory overhead required for splat sorting operations. This work presents a unified differentiable hardware rasterization method that simultaneously optimizes runtime and memory usage for 3DGS, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained devices with limited memory capacity."
2505.18772,"Learning on triangle meshes has recently proven to be instrumental to a myriad of tasks, from shape classification, to segmentation, to deformation and animation, to mention just a few. While some of these applications are tackled through neural network architectures which are tailored to the application at hand, many others use generic frameworks for triangle meshes where the only customization required is the modification of the input features and the loss function. Our goal in this paper is to broaden the applicability of these generic frameworks to ""wild"", i.e. meshes in-the-wild which often have multiple components, non-manifold elements, disrupted connectivity, or a combination of these. We propose a configurable meta-framework based on the concept of caged geometry: Given a mesh, a cage is a single component manifold triangle mesh that envelopes it closely. Generalized barycentric coordinates map between functions on the cage, and functions on the mesh, allowing us to learn and test on a variety of data, in different applications. We demonstrate this concept by learning segmentation and skinning weights on difficult data, achieving better performance to state of the art techniques on wild meshes."
2505.18805,"Hair cards remain a widely used representation for hair modeling in real-time applications, offering a practical trade-off between visual fidelity, memory usage, and performance. However, generating high-quality hair card models remains a challenging and labor-intensive task. This work presents an automated pipeline for converting strand-based hair models into hair card models with a limited number of cards and textures while preserving the hairstyle appearance. Our key idea is a novel differentiable representation where each strand is encoded as a projected 2D spline in the texture space, which enables efficient optimization with differentiable rendering and structured results respecting the hair geometry. Based on this representation, we develop a novel algorithm pipeline, where we first cluster hair strands into initial hair cards and project the strands into the texture space. We then conduct a two-stage optimization where our first stage optimizes the texture and geometry of each hair card separately, and after texture reduction, our second stage conducts joint optimization of all the cards for fine-tuning. Put together, our method is evaluated on a wide range of hairstyles, including straight, wavy, curly, and coily hairs. To better capture the appearance of short or coily hair, we additionally support hair cap and cross-card. Furthermore, our framework supports seamless LoD transitions via texture sharing, balancing texture memory efficiency and visual quality."
2505.19151,"Leveraging the diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, models like Sora, CogVideoX and Wan have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video, image-to-video, and video editing tasks. Despite these advances, diffusion-based video generation remains computationally intensive, especially for high-resolution, long-duration videos. Prior work accelerates its inference by skipping computation, usually at the cost of severe quality degradation. In this paper, we propose SRDiffusion, a novel framework that leverages collaboration between large and small models to reduce inference cost. The large model handles high-noise steps to ensure semantic and motion fidelity (Sketching), while the smaller model refines visual details in low-noise steps (Rendering). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, over 3$\times$ speedup for Wan with nearly no quality loss for VBench, and 2$\times$ speedup for CogVideoX. Our method is introduced as a new direction orthogonal to existing acceleration strategies, offering a practical solution for scalable video generation."
2505.19672,"Fluorescent materials are characterized by a spectral reradiation toward longer wavelengths. Recent work [Fichet et al. 2024] has shown that the rendering of fluorescence in a non-spectral engine is possible through the use of appropriate reduced reradiation matrices. But the approach has limited expressivity, as it requires the storage of one reduced matrix per fluorescent material, and only works with measured fluorescent assets.In this work, we introduce an analytical approach to the editing and rendering of fluorescence in a non-spectral engine. It is based on a decomposition of the reduced reradiation matrix, and an analytically-integrable Gaussian-based model of the fluorescent component. The model reproduces the appearance of fluorescent materials accurately, especially with the addition of a UV basis. Most importantly, it grants variations of fluorescent material parameters in real-time, either for the editing of fluorescent materials, or for the dynamic spatial variation of fluorescence properties across object surfaces. A simplified one-Gaussian fluorescence model even allows for the artist-friendly creation of plausible fluorescent materials from scratch, requiring only a few reflectance colors as input."
2505.19713,"In this work, we introduce CAD-Coder, a novel framework that reformulates text-to-CAD as the generation of CadQuery scripts - a Python-based, parametric CAD language. This representation enables direct geometric validation, a richer modeling vocabulary, and seamless integration with existing LLMs. To further enhance code validity and geometric fidelity, we propose a two-stage learning pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on paired text-CadQuery data, and (2) reinforcement learning with Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by a CAD-specific reward comprising both a geometric reward (Chamfer Distance) and a format reward. We also introduce a chain-of-thought (CoT) planning process to improve model reasoning, and construct a large-scale, high-quality dataset of 110K text-CadQuery-3D model triplets and 1.5K CoT samples via an automated pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAD-Coder enables LLMs to generate diverse, valid, and complex CAD models directly from natural language, advancing the state of the art of text-to-CAD generation and geometric reasoning."
2505.19976,"We introduce a novel method for controlling a motion sequence using an arbitrary temporal control sequence using temporal alignment. Temporal alignment of motion has gained significant attention owing to its applications in motion control and retargeting. Traditional methods rely on either learned or hand-craft cross-domain mappings between frames in the original and control domains, which often require large, paired, or annotated datasets and time-consuming training. Our approach, named Metric-Aligning Motion Matching, achieves alignment by solely considering within-domain distances. It computes distances among patches in each domain and seeks a matching that optimally aligns the two within-domain distances. This framework allows for the alignment of a motion sequence to various types of control sequences, including sketches, labels, audio, and another motion sequence, all without the need for manually defined mappings or training with annotated data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through applications in efficient motion control, showcasing its potential in practical scenarios."
2505.20421,"Discontinuities in spatial derivatives appear in a wide range of physical systems, from creased thin sheets to materials with sharp stiffness transitions. Accurately modeling these features is essential for simulation but remains challenging for traditional mesh-based methods, which require discontinuity-aligned remeshing -- entangling geometry with simulation and hindering generalization across shape families.Neural fields offer an appealing alternative by encoding basis functions as smooth, continuous functions over space, enabling simulation across varying shapes. However, their smoothness makes them poorly suited for representing gradient discontinuities. Prior work addresses discontinuities in function values, but capturing sharp changes in spatial derivatives while maintaining function continuity has received little attention.We introduce a neural field construction that captures gradient discontinuities without baking their location into the network weights. By augmenting input coordinates with a smoothly clamped distance function in a lifting framework, we enable encoding of gradient jumps at evolving interfaces.This design supports discretization-agnostic simulation of parametrized shape families with heterogeneous materials and evolving creases, enabling new reduced-order capabilities such as shape morphing, interactive crease editing, and simulation of soft-rigid hybrid structures. We further demonstrate that our method can be combined with previous lifting techniques to jointly capture both gradient and value discontinuities, supporting simultaneous cuts and creases within a unified model."
2505.20431,"We introduce a 3D detailizer, a neural model which can instantaneously (in <1s) transform a coarse 3D shape proxy into a high-quality asset with detailed geometry and texture as guided by an input text prompt. Our model is trained using the text prompt, which defines the shape class and characterizes the appearance and fine-grained style of the generated details. The coarse 3D proxy, which can be easily varied and adjusted (e.g., via user editing), provides structure control over the final shape. Importantly, our detailizer is not optimized for a single shape; it is the result of distilling a generative model, so that it can be reused, without retraining, to generate any number of shapes, with varied structures, whose local details all share a consistent style and appearance. Our detailizer training utilizes a pretrained multi-view image diffusion model, with text conditioning, to distill the foundational knowledge therein into our detailizer via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To improve SDS and enable our detailizer architecture to learn generalizable features over complex structures, we train our model in two training stages to generate shapes with increasing structural complexity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method generates shapes of superior quality and details compared to existing text-to-3D models under varied structure control. Our detailizer can refine a coarse shape in less than a second, making it possible to interactively author and adjust 3D shapes. Furthermore, the user-imposed structure control can lead to creative, and hence out-of-distribution, 3D asset generations that are beyond the current capabilities of leading text-to-3D generative models. We demonstrate an interactive 3D modeling workflow our method enables, and its strong generalizability over styles, structures, and object categories."
2505.20434,"Low-discrepancy sequences have seen widespread adoption in computer graphics thanks to their superior convergence rates. Since rendering integrals often comprise products of lower-dimensional integrals, recent work has focused on developing sequences that are also well-distributed in lower-dimensional projections. To this end, we introduce a novel construction of binary-based (0, 4)-sequences; that is, progressive fully multi-stratified sequences of 4D points, and extend the idea to higher power-of-two dimensions. We further show that not only it is possible to nest lower-dimensional sequences in higher-dimensional ones -- for example, embedding a (0, 2)-sequence within our (0, 4)-sequence -- but that we can ensemble two (0, 2)-sequences into a (0, 4)-sequence, four (0, 4)-sequences into a (0, 16)-sequence, and so on. Such sequences can provide excellent convergence rates when integrals include lower-dimensional integration problems in 2, 4, 16, ... dimensions. Our construction is based on using 2$\times$2 block matrices as symbols to construct larger matrices that potentially generate a sequence with the target (0, s)-sequence in base $s$ property. We describe how to search for suitable alphabets and identify two distinct, cross-related alphabets of block symbols, which we call S and Z, hence \emph{SZ} for the resulting family of sequences. Given the alphabets, we construct candidate generator matrices and search for valid sets of matrices. We then infer a formula to construct full-resolution (64-bit) matrices. Our binayr generator matrices allow highly efficient implementation using bitwise operations, and can be used as a drop-in replacement for Sobol matrices in existing applications. We compare SZ sequences to state-of-the-art low discrepancy sequences, and demonstrate mean relative squared error improvements up to $1.93\times$ in common rendering applications."
2505.20457,"The distribution and evolution of several real-world quantities, such as temperature, pressure, light, and heat, are modelled mathematically using Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Solving PDEs defined on arbitrary 3D domains, say a 3D scan of a turbine's blade, is computationally expensive and scales quadratically with discretization. Traditional workflows in research and industry exploit variants of the finite element method (FEM), but some key benefits of using Monte Carlo (MC) methods have been identified. We use sparse and approximate MC estimates to infer adaptive discretization. We achieve this by training a neural network that is lightweight and that generalizes across shapes and boundary conditions. Our algorithm, Learned Adaptive Mesh Generation (LAMG), maps a set of sparse MC estimates of the solution to a sizing field that defines a local (adaptive) spatial resolution. We then use standard methods to generate tetrahedral meshes that respect the sizing field, and obtain the solution via one FEM computation on the adaptive mesh. We train the network to mimic a computationally expensive method that requires multiple (iterative) FEM solves. Thus, our one-shot method is $2\times$ to $4\times$ faster than adaptive methods for FEM or MC while achieving similar error. Our learning framework is lightweight and versatile. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a large dataset of meshes."
2505.20473,"Neural fields are a highly effective representation across visual computing. This work observes that fitting these fields is greatly improved by incorporating spatial stochasticity during training, and that this simple technique can replace or even outperform custom-designed hierarchies and frequency space constructions. The approach is formalized as implicitly operating on a blurred version of the field, evaluated in-expectation by sampling with Gaussian-distributed offsets. Querying the blurred field during optimization greatly improves convergence and robustness, akin to the role of preconditioners in numerical linear algebra. This implicit, sampling-based perspective fits naturally into the neural field paradigm, comes at no additional cost, and is extremely simple to implement. We describe the basic theory of this technique, including details such as handling boundary conditions, and extending to a spatially-varying blur. Experiments demonstrate this approach on representations including coordinate MLPs, neural hashgrids, triplanes, and more, across tasks including surface reconstruction and radiance fields. In settings where custom-designed hierarchies have already been developed, stochastic preconditioning nearly matches or improves their performance with a simple and unified approach; in settings without existing hierarchies it provides an immediate boost to quality and robustness."
2505.21013,"Newton's Method is widely used to find the solution of complex non-linear simulation problems in Computer Graphics. To guarantee a descent direction, it is common practice to clamp the negative eigenvalues of each element Hessian prior to assembly - a strategy known as Projected Newton (PN) - but this perturbation often hinders convergence.In this work, we observe that projecting only a small subset of element Hessians is sufficient to secure a descent direction. Building on this insight, we introduce Progressively Projected Newton (PPN), a novel variant of Newton's Method that uses the current iterate residual to cheaply determine the subset of element Hessians to project. The global Hessian thus remains closer to its original form, reducing both the number of Newton iterations and the amount of required eigen-decompositions.We compare PPN with PN and Project-on-Demand Newton (PDN) in a comprehensive set of experiments covering contact-free and contact-rich deformables (including large stiffness and mass ratios), co-dimensional, and rigid-body simulations, and a range of time step sizes, tolerances and resolutions. PPN consistently performs fewer than 10% of the projections required by PN or PDN and, in the vast majority of cases, converges in fewer Newton iterations, which makes PPN the fastest solver in our benchmark. The most notable exceptions are simulations with very large time steps and quasistatics, where PN remains a better choice."
2505.21041,"Accurate and efficient modeling of large-scale urban scenes is critical for applications such as AR navigation, UAV based inspection, and smart city digital twins. While aerial imagery offers broad coverage and complements limitations of ground-based data, reconstructing city-scale environments from such views remains challenging due to occlusions, incomplete geometry, and high memory demands. Recent advances like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) improve scalability and visual quality but remain limited by dense primitive usage, long training times, and poor suit ability for edge devices. We propose CityGo, a hybrid framework that combines textured proxy geometry with residual and surrounding 3D Gaussians for lightweight, photorealistic rendering of urban scenes from aerial perspectives. Our approach first extracts compact building proxy meshes from MVS point clouds, then uses zero order SH Gaussians to generate occlusion-free textures via image-based rendering and back-projection. To capture high-frequency details, we introduce residual Gaussians placed based on proxy-photo discrepancies and guided by depth priors. Broader urban context is represented by surrounding Gaussians, with importance-aware downsampling applied to non-critical regions to reduce redundancy. A tailored optimization strategy jointly refines proxy textures and Gaussian parameters, enabling real-time rendering of complex urban scenes on mobile GPUs with significantly reduced training and memory requirements. Extensive experiments on real-world aerial datasets demonstrate that our hybrid representation significantly reduces training time, achieving on average 1.4x speedup, while delivering comparable visual fidelity to pure 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches. Furthermore, CityGo enables real-time rendering of large-scale urban scenes on mobile consumer GPUs, with substantially reduced memory usage and energy consumption."
2505.21146,"Existing human motion generation methods with trajectory and pose inputs operate global processing on both modalities, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability of motion generation by the diffusion model."
2505.21252,"Shadow art is an exciting form of sculptural art that produces captivating artistic effects through the 2D shadows cast by 3D shapes. Hand shadows, also known as shadow puppetry or shadowgraphy, involve creating various shapes and figures using your hands and fingers to cast meaningful shadows on a wall. In this work, we propose a differentiable rendering-based approach to deform hand models such that they cast a shadow consistent with a desired target image and the associated lighting configuration. We showcase the results of shadows cast by a pair of two hands and the interpolation of hand poses between two desired shadow images. We believe that this work will be a useful tool for the graphics community."
2505.21319,"Function fitting/approximation plays a fundamental role in computer graphics and other engineering applications. While recent advances have explored neural networks to address this task, these methods often rely on architectures with many parameters, limiting their practical applicability. In contrast, we pursue high-quality function approximation using parameter-efficient representations that eliminate the dependency on neural networks entirely. We first propose a novel framework for continuous function modeling. Most existing works can be formulated using this framework. We then introduce a compact function representation, which is based on polynomials interpolated using radial basis functions, bypassing both neural networks and complex/hierarchical data structures. We also develop memory-efficient CUDA-optimized algorithms that reduce computational time and memory consumption to less than 10% compared to conventional automatic differentiation frameworks. Finally, we validate our representation and optimization pipeline through extensive experiments on 3D signed distance functions (SDFs). The proposed representation achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art techniques (e.g., octree/hash-grid techniques) with significantly fewer parameters."
2505.21335,"Recent advancements in neural 3D representations, such as neural radiance fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), have enabled the accurate estimation of 3D structures from multiview images. However, this capability is limited to estimating the visible external structure, and identifying the invisible internal structure hidden behind the surface is difficult. To overcome this limitation, we address a new task called Structure from Collision (SfC), which aims to estimate the structure (including the invisible internal structure) of an object from appearance changes during collision. To solve this problem, we propose a novel model called SfC-NeRF that optimizes the invisible internal structure of an object through a video sequence under physical, appearance (i.e., visible external structure)-preserving, and keyframe constraints. In particular, to avoid falling into undesirable local optima owing to its ill-posed nature, we propose volume annealing; that is, searching for global optima by repeatedly reducing and expanding the volume. Extensive experiments on 115 objects involving diverse structures (i.e., various cavity shapes, locations, and sizes) and material properties revealed the properties of SfC and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed SfC-NeRF."
2505.21437,"Synthesizing whole-body manipulation of articulated objects, including body motion, hand motion, and object motion, is a critical yet challenging task with broad applications in virtual humans and robotics. The core challenges are twofold. First, achieving realistic whole-body motion requires tight coordination between the hands and the rest of the body, as their movements are interdependent during manipulation. Second, articulated object manipulation typically involves high degrees of freedom and demands higher precision, often requiring the fingers to be placed at specific regions to actuate movable parts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel coordinated diffusion noise optimization framework. Specifically, we perform noise-space optimization over three specialized diffusion models for the body, left hand, and right hand, each trained on its own motion dataset to improve generalization. Coordination naturally emerges through gradient flow along the human kinematic chain, allowing the global body posture to adapt in response to hand motion objectives with high fidelity. To further enhance precision in hand-object interaction, we adopt a unified representation based on basis point sets (BPS), where end-effector positions are encoded as distances to the same BPS used for object geometry. This unified representation captures fine-grained spatial relationships between the hand and articulated object parts, and the resulting trajectories serve as targets to guide the optimization of diffusion noise, producing highly accurate interaction motion. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that our method outperforms existing approaches in motion quality and physical plausibility, and enables various capabilities such as object pose control, simultaneous walking and manipulation, and whole-body generation from hand-only data."
2505.21925,"We present RenderFormer, a neural rendering pipeline that directly renders an image from a triangle-based representation of a scene with full global illumination effects and that does not require per-scene training or fine-tuning. Instead of taking a physics-centric approach to rendering, we formulate rendering as a sequence-to-sequence transformation where a sequence of tokens representing triangles with reflectance properties is converted to a sequence of output tokens representing small patches of pixels. RenderFormer follows a two stage pipeline: a view-independent stage that models triangle-to-triangle light transport, and a view-dependent stage that transforms a token representing a bundle of rays to the corresponding pixel values guided by the triangle-sequence from the view-independent stage. Both stages are based on the transformer architecture and are learned with minimal prior constraints. We demonstrate and evaluate RenderFormer on scenes with varying complexity in shape and light transport."
2505.21946,"We propose the Vortex Particle Flow Map (VPFM) method to simulate incompressible flow with complex vortical evolution in the presence of dynamic solid boundaries. The core insight of our approach is that vorticity is an ideal quantity for evolution on particle flow maps, enabling significantly longer flow map distances compared to other fluid quantities like velocity or impulse. To achieve this goal, we developed a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation that evolves vorticity and flow map quantities on vortex particles, while reconstructing velocity on a background grid. The method integrates three key components: (1) a vorticity-based particle flow map framework, (2) an accurate Hessian evolution scheme on particles, and (3) a solid boundary treatment for no-through and no-slip conditions in VPFM. These components collectively allow a substantially longer flow map length (3-12 times longer) than the state-of-the-art, enhancing vorticity preservation over extended spatiotemporal domains. We validated the performance of VPFM through diverse simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex vortex dynamics and turbulence phenomena."
2505.224,"Although dynamic scene reconstruction has long been a fundamental challenge in 3D vision, the recent emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising direction by enabling high-quality, real-time rendering through explicit Gaussian primitives. However, existing 3DGS-based methods for dynamic reconstruction often suffer from \textit{spatio-temporal incoherence} during initialization, where canonical Gaussians are constructed by aggregating observations from multiple frames without temporal distinction. This results in spatio-temporally entangled representations, making it difficult to model dynamic motion accurately. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{STDR} (Spatio-Temporal Decoupling for Real-time rendering), a plug-and-play module that learns spatio-temporal probability distributions for each Gaussian. STDR introduces a spatio-temporal mask, a separated deformation field, and a consistency regularization to jointly disentangle spatial and temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating our module into existing 3DGS-based dynamic scene reconstruction frameworks leads to notable improvements in both reconstruction quality and spatio-temporal consistency across synthetic and real-world benchmarks."
2505.22416,"Accurately retargeting facial expressions to a face mesh while enabling manipulation is a key challenge in facial animation retargeting. Recent deep-learning methods address this by encoding facial expressions into a global latent code, but they often fail to capture fine-grained details in local regions. While some methods improve local accuracy by transferring deformations locally, this often complicates overall control of the facial expression. To address this, we propose a method that combines the strengths of both global and local deformation models. Our approach enables intuitive control and detailed expression cloning across diverse face meshes, regardless of their underlying structures. The core idea is to localize the influence of the global latent code on the target mesh. Our model learns to predict skinning weights for each vertex of the target face mesh through indirect supervision from predefined segmentation labels. These predicted weights localize the global latent code, enabling precise and region-specific deformations even for meshes with unseen shapes. We supervise the latent code using Facial Action Coding System (FACS)-based blendshapes to ensure interpretability and allow straightforward editing of the generated animation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of expression fidelity, deformation transfer accuracy, and adaptability across diverse mesh structures."
2505.23301,"Virtual human animations have a wide range of applications in virtual and augmented reality. While automatic generation methods of animated virtual humans have been developed, assessing their quality remains challenging. Recently, approaches introducing task-oriented evaluation metrics have been proposed, leveraging neural network training. However, quality assessment measures for animated virtual humans that are not generated with parametric body models have yet to be developed. In this context, we introduce a first such quality assessment measure leveraging a novel data-driven framework. First, we generate a dataset of virtual human animations together with their corresponding subjective realism evaluation scores collected with a user study. Second, we use the resulting dataset to learn predicting perceptual evaluation scores. Results indicate that training a linear regressor on our dataset results in a correlation of 90%, which outperforms a state of the art deep learning baseline."
2505.23447,"This paper contributes a set of quality metrics for identification and visual analysis of structured missingness in high-dimensional data. Missing values in data are a frequent challenge in most data generating domains and may cause a range of analysis issues. Structural missingness in data may indicate issues in data collection and pre-processing, but may also highlight important data characteristics. While research into statistical methods for dealing with missing data are mainly focusing on replacing missing values with plausible estimated values, visualization has great potential to support a more in-depth understanding of missingness structures in data. Nonetheless, while the interest in missing data visualization has increased in the last decade, it is still a relatively overlooked research topic with a comparably small number of publications, few of which address scalability issues. Efficient visual analysis approaches are needed to enable exploration of missingness structures in large and high-dimensional data, and to support informed decision-making in context of potential data quality issues. This paper suggests a set of quality metrics for identification of patterns of interest for understanding of structural missingness in data. These quality metrics can be used as guidance in visual analysis, as demonstrated through a use case exploring structural missingness in data from a real-life walking monitoring study.

2505.23969,"Designing subspaces for Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) is crucial for accelerating finite element simulations in graphics and engineering. Unfortunately, it's not always clear which subspace is optimal for arbitrary dynamic simulation. We propose to construct simulation subspaces from force distributions, allowing us to tailor such subspaces to common scene interactions involving constraint penalties, handles-based control, contact and musculoskeletal actuation. To achieve this we adopt a statistical perspective on Reduced Order Modelling, which allows us to push such user-designed force distributions through a linearized simulation to obtain a dual distribution on displacements. To construct our subspace, we then fit a low-rank Gaussian model to this displacement distribution, which we show generalizes Linear Modal Analysis subspaces for uncorrelated unit variance force distributions, as well as Green's Function subspaces for low rank force distributions. We show our framework allows for the construction of subspaces that are optimal both with respect to physical material properties, as well as arbitrary force distributions as observed in handle-based, contact, and musculoskeletal scene interactions."
2505.24053,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) marks a significant milestone in balancing the quality and efficiency of differentiable rendering. However, its high efficiency stems from an approximation of projecting 3D Gaussians onto the image plane as 2D Gaussians, which inherently limits rendering quality--particularly under large Field-of-View (FoV) camera inputs. While several recent works have extended 3DGS to mitigate these approximation errors, none have successfully achieved both exactness and high efficiency simultaneously. In this work, we introduce 3DGEER, an Exact and Efficient Volumetric Gaussian Rendering method. Starting from first principles, we derive a closed-form expression for the density integral along a ray traversing a 3D Gaussian distribution. This formulation enables precise forward rendering with arbitrary camera models and supports gradient-based optimization of 3D Gaussian parameters. To ensure both exactness and real-time performance, we propose an efficient method for computing a tight Particle Bounding Frustum (PBF) for each 3D Gaussian, enabling accurate and efficient ray-Gaussian association. We also introduce a novel Bipolar Equiangular Projection (BEAP) representation to accelerate ray association under generic camera models. BEAP further provides a more uniform ray sampling strategy to apply supervision, which empirically improves reconstruction quality. Experiments on multiple pinhole and fisheye datasets show that our method consistently outperforms prior methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in real-time neural rendering."
2505.24653,"Memory bandwidth constraints continue to be a significant limiting factor in ray tracing performance, particularly as scene complexity grows and computational capabilities outpace memory access speeds. This paper presents a memory-efficient ray tracing methodology that integrates compressed data structures with ray stream techniques to reduce memory traffic. The approach implements compressed BVH and triangle representations to minimize acceleration structure size in combination with ray stream tracing to reduce traversal stack memory traffic. The technique employs fixed-point arithmetic for intersection tests for prospective hardware with tailored integer operations. Despite using reduced precision, geometric holes are avoided by leveraging fixed-point arithmetic instead of encountering the floating-point rounding errors common in traditional approaches. Quantitative analysis demonstrates significant memory traffic reduction across various scene complexities and BVH configurations. The presented 8-wide BVH ray stream implementation reduces memory traffic to only 18% of traditional approaches by using 8-bit quantization for box and triangle coordinates and directly ray tracing these quantized structures. These reductions are especially beneficial for bandwidth-constrained hardware environments such as mobile devices. This integrated approach addresses both memory bandwidth limitations and numerical precision challenges inherent to modern ray tracing applications."
2505.24796,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) renders pixels by rasterizing Gaussian primitives, where conditional alpha-blending dominates the computational cost in the rendering pipeline. This paper proposes TC-GS, an algorithm-independent universal module that expands the applicability of Tensor Core (TCU) for 3DGS, leading to substantial speedups and seamless integration into existing 3DGS optimization frameworks. The key innovation lies in mapping alpha computation to matrix multiplication, fully utilizing otherwise idle TCUs in existing 3DGS implementations. TC-GS provides plug-and-play acceleration for existing top-tier acceleration algorithms and integrates seamlessly with rendering pipeline designs, such as Gaussian compression and redundancy elimination algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a global-to-local coordinate transformation to mitigate rounding errors from quadratic terms of pixel coordinates caused by Tensor Core half-precision computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains rendering quality while providing an additional 2.18x speedup over existing Gaussian acceleration algorithms, thereby achieving a total acceleration of up to 5.6x."
2506.00173,"We present MotionPersona, a novel real-time character controller that allows users to characterize a character by specifying attributes such as physical traits, mental states, and demographics, and projects these properties into the generated motions for animating the character. In contrast to existing deep learning-based controllers, which typically produce homogeneous animations tailored to a single, predefined character, MotionPersona accounts for the impact of various traits on human motion as observed in the real world. To achieve this, we develop a block autoregressive motion diffusion model conditioned on SMPLX parameters, textual prompts, and user-defined locomotion control signals. We also curate a comprehensive dataset featuring a wide range of locomotion types and actor traits to enable the training of this characteristic-aware controller. Unlike prior work, MotionPersona is the first method capable of generating motion that faithfully reflects user-specified characteristics (e.g., an elderly person's shuffling gait) while responding in real time to dynamic control inputs. Additionally, we introduce a few-shot characterization technique as a complementary conditioning mechanism, enabling customization via short motion clips when language prompts fall short. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MotionPersona outperforms existing methods in characteristics-aware locomotion control, achieving superior motion quality and diversity. Results, code, and demo can be found at:this https URL."
2506.00222,"We introduce a novel method for directional-field design on meshes, enabling users to specify singularities at any location on a mesh. Our method uses a piecewise power-linear representation for phase and scale, offering precise control over field topology. The resulting fields are smooth and accommodate any singularity index and field symmetry. With this representation, we mitigate the artifacts caused by coarse or uneven meshes. We showcase our approach on meshes with diverse topologies and triangle qualities."
2506.00512,"Text-guided 3D editing aims to precisely edit semantically relevant local 3D regions, which has significant potential for various practical applications ranging from 3D games to film production. Existing methods typically follow a view-indiscriminate paradigm: editing 2D views indiscriminately and projecting them back into 3D space. However, they overlook the different cross-view interdependencies, resulting in inconsistent multi-view editing. In this study, we argue that ideal consistent 3D editing can be achieved through a \textit{progressive-views paradigm}, which propagates editing semantics from the editing-salient view to other editing-sparse views. Specifically, we propose \textit{Pro3D-Editor}, a novel framework, which mainly includes Primary-view Sampler, Key-view Render, and Full-view Refiner. Primary-view Sampler dynamically samples and edits the most editing-salient view as the primary view. Key-view Render accurately propagates editing semantics from the primary view to other key views through its Mixture-of-View-Experts Low-Rank Adaption (MoVE-LoRA). Full-view Refiner edits and refines the 3D object based on the edited multi-views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in editing accuracy and spatial consistency."
2506.00839,"In this paper, we present a neural path guiding method to aid with Monte Carlo (MC) integration in rendering. Existing neural methods utilize distribution representations that are either fast or expressive, but not both. We propose a simple, but effective, representation that is sufficiently expressive and reasonably fast. Specifically, we break down the 2D distribution over the directional domain into two 1D probability distribution functions (PDF). We propose to model each 1D PDF using a neural network that estimates the distribution at a set of discrete coordinates. The PDF at an arbitrary location can then be evaluated and sampled through interpolation. To train the network, we maximize the similarity of the learned and target distributions. To reduce the variance of the gradient during optimizations and estimate the normalization factor, we propose to cache the incoming radiance using an additional network. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is better than the existing methods, particularly in challenging scenes with complex light transport."
2506.0087,"Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR) has long been used to create artistic visualizations that prioritize style over realism, enabling the depiction of a wide range of aesthetic effects, from hand-drawn sketches to painterly renderings. While classical NPR methods, such as edge detection, toon shading, and geometric abstraction, have been well-established in both research and practice, with a particular focus on stroke-based rendering, the recent rise of deep learning represents a paradigm shift. We analyze the similarities and differences between classical and neural network based NPR techniques, focusing on stroke-based rendering (SBR), highlighting their strengths and limitations. We discuss trade offs in quality and artistic control between these paradigms, propose a framework where these approaches can be combined for new possibilities in expressive rendering."
2506.00988,"Digital creators, from indie filmmakers to animation studios, face a persistent bottleneck: translating their creative vision into precise camera movements. Despite significant progress in computer vision and artificial intelligence, current automated filming systems struggle with a fundamental trade-off between mechanical execution and creative intent. Crucially, almost all previous works simplify the subject to a single point-ignoring its orientation and true volume-severely limiting spatial awareness during filming. LensCraft solves this problem by mimicking the expertise of a professional cinematographer, using a data-driven approach that combines cinematographic principles with the flexibility to adapt to dynamic scenes in real time. Our solution combines a specialized simulation framework for generating high-fidelity training data with an advanced neural model that is faithful to the script while being aware of the volume and dynamic behavior of the subject. Additionally, our approach allows for flexible control via various input modalities, including text prompts, subject trajectory and volume, key points, or a full camera trajectory, offering creators a versatile tool to guide camera movements in line with their vision. Leveraging a lightweight real time architecture, LensCraft achieves markedly lower computational complexity and faster inference while maintaining high output quality. Extensive evaluation across static and dynamic scenarios reveals unprecedented accuracy and coherence, setting a new benchmark for intelligent camera systems compared to state-of-the-art models. Extended results, the complete dataset, simulation environment, trained model weights, and source code are publicly accessible on LensCraft Webpage."
2506.01077,"Large Language Model (LLM)-driven digital humans have sparked a series of recent studies on co-speech gesture generation systems. However, existing approaches struggle with real-time synthesis and long-text comprehension. This paper introduces Transformer-Based Rich Motion Matching (TRiMM), a novel multi-modal framework for real-time 3D gesture generation. Our method incorporates three modules: 1) a cross-modal attention mechanism to achieve precise temporal alignment between speech and gestures; 2) a long-context autoregressive model with a sliding window mechanism for effective sequence modeling; 3) a large-scale gesture matching system that constructs an atomic action library and enables real-time retrieval. Additionally, we develop a lightweight pipeline implemented in the Unreal Engine for experimentation. Our approach achieves real-time inference at 120 fps and maintains a per-sentence latency of 0.15 seconds on consumer-grade GPUs (Geforce RTX3060). Extensive subjective and objective evaluations on the ZEGGS, and BEAT datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. TRiMM enhances the speed of co-speech gesture generation while ensuring gesture quality, enabling LLM-driven digital humans to respond to speech in real time and synthesize corresponding gestures.

2506.01091,"Visual effects (VFX) are key to immersion in modern films, games, and AR/VR. Creating 3D effects requires specialized expertise and training in 3D animation software and can be time consuming. Generative solutions typically rely on computationally intense methods such as diffusion models which can be slow at 4D inference. We reformulate 3D animation as a field prediction task and introduce a text-driven framework that infers a time-varying 4D flow field acting on 3D Gaussians. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for function generation, our approach interprets arbitrary prompts (e.g., ""make the vase glow orange, then explode"") and instantly updates color, opacity, and positions of 3D Gaussians in real time. This design avoids overheads such as mesh extraction, manual or physics-based simulations and allows both novice and expert users to animate volumetric scenes with minimal effort on a consumer device even in a web browser. Experimental results show that simple textual instructions suffice to generate compelling time-varying VFX, reducing the manual effort typically required for rigging or advanced modeling. We thus present a fast and accessible pathway to language-driven 3D content creation that can pave the way to democratize VFX further."
2506.01288,"Global illumination combines direct and indirect lighting to create realistic lighting effects, bringing virtual scenes closer to reality. Static global illumination is a crucial component of virtual scene rendering, leveraging precomputation and baking techniques to significantly reduce runtime computational costs. Unfortunately, many existing works prioritize visual quality by relying on extensive texture storage and massive pixel-level texture sampling, leading to large performance overhead. In this paper, we introduce an illumination reconstruction method that effectively reduces sampling in fragment shader and avoids additional render passes, making it well-suited for low-end platforms. To achieve high-quality global illumination with reduced memory usage, we adopt a spherical harmonics fitting approach for baking effective illumination information and propose an inverse probe distribution method that generates unique probe associations for each mesh. This association, which can be generated offline in the local space, ensures consistent lighting quality across all instances of the same mesh. As a consequence, our method delivers highly competitive lighting effects while using only approximately 5% of the memory required by mainstream industry techniques."
2506.01591,"Advances in talking-head animation based on Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) enable the creation of highly realistic, synchronized videos. These fabricated videos are indistinguishable from real ones, increasing the risk of potential misuse for scams, political manipulation, and misinformation. Hence, addressing these ethical concerns has become a pressing issue in AI security. Recent proactive defense studies focused on countering LDM-based models by adding perturbations to portraits. However, these methods are ineffective at protecting reference portraits from advanced image-to-video animation. The limitations are twofold: 1) they fail to prevent images from being manipulated by audio signals, and 2) diffusion-based purification techniques can effectively eliminate protective perturbations. To address these challenges, we propose Silencer, a two-stage method designed to proactively protect the privacy of portraits. First, a nullifying loss is proposed to ignore audio control in talking-head generation. Second, we apply anti-purification loss in LDM to optimize the inverted latent feature to generate robust perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Silencer in proactively protecting portrait privacy. We hope this work will raise awareness among the AI security community regarding critical ethical issues related to talking-head generation techniques. Code:this https URL."
2506.01929,"Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse images from natural language prompts. However, they often fail to produce semantically accurate results when the prompt contains concept combinations that contradict their learned priors. We define this failure mode as contextual contradiction, where one concept implicitly negates another due to entangled associations learned during training. To address this, we propose a stage-aware prompt decomposition framework that guides the denoising process using a sequence of proxy prompts. Each proxy prompt is constructed to match the semantic content expected to emerge at a specific stage of denoising, while ensuring contextual coherence. To construct these proxy prompts, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to analyze the target prompt, identify contradictions, and generate alternative expressions that preserve the original intent while resolving contextual conflicts. By aligning prompt information with the denoising progression, our method enables fine-grained semantic control and accurate image generation in the presence of contextual contradictions. Experiments across a variety of challenging prompts show substantial improvements in alignment to the textual prompt."
2506.02034,"Although the inverted vial test has been widely used as a qualitative method for estimating fluid viscosity, quantitative rheological characterization has remained limited due to its complex, uncontrolled flow - driven by gravity, surface tension, inertia, and initial conditions. Here, we present a computer vision (CV) viscometer that automates the inverted vial test and enables quantitative viscosity inference across nearly five orders of magnitude (0.01-1000 Pas), without requiring direct velocity field measurements. The system simultaneously inverts multiple vials and records videos of the evolving fluid, which are fed into a neural network that approximates the inverse function from visual features and known fluid density. Despite the complex, multi-regime flow within the vial, our approach achieves relative errors below 25%, improving to 15% for viscosities above 0.1 Pas. When tested on non-Newtonian polymer solutions, the method reliably estimates zero-shear viscosity as long as viscoelastic or shear-thinning behaviors remain negligible within the flow regime. Moreover, high standard deviations in the inferred values may serve as a proxy for identifying fluids with strong non-Newtonian behavior. The CV viscometer requires only one camera and one motor, is contactless and low-cost, and can be easily integrated into high-throughput experimental automated and manual workflows. Transcending traditional characterization paradigms, our method leverages uncontrolled flows and visual features to achieve simplicity and scalability, enabling high-throughput viscosity inference that can meet the growing demand of data-driven material models while remaining accessible to lower resource environments."

2506.0262,"Texture map production is an important part of 3D modeling and determines the rendering quality. Recently, diffusion-based methods have opened a new way for texture generation. However, restricted control flexibility and limited prompt modalities may prevent creators from producing desired results. Furthermore, inconsistencies between generated multi-view images often lead to poor texture generation quality. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FlexPainter}, a novel texture generation pipeline that enables flexible multi-modal conditional guidance and achieves highly consistent texture generation. A shared conditional embedding space is constructed to perform flexible aggregation between different input modalities. Utilizing such embedding space, we present an image-based CFG method to decompose structural and style information, achieving reference image-based stylization. Leveraging the 3D knowledge within the image diffusion prior, we first generate multi-view images simultaneously using a grid representation to enhance global understanding. Meanwhile, we propose a view synchronization and adaptive weighting module during diffusion sampling to further ensure local consistency. Finally, a 3D-aware texture completion model combined with a texture enhancement model is used to generate seamless, high-resolution texture maps. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both flexibility and generation quality."

However, rendering city-scale 3DGS scenes on resource-constrained mobile devices in real-time remains a significant challenge due to two compute-intensive stages: level-of-detail (LoD) search and rasterization.In this paper, we propose Voyager, an effective solution to accelerate city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Our key insight is that, under normal user motion, the number of newly visible Gaussians within the view frustum remains roughly constant. Leveraging this temporal correlation, we propose a temporal-aware LoD search to identify the necessary Gaussians for the remaining rendering stages. For the remaining rendering process, we accelerate the bottleneck stage, rasterization, via preemptive $\alpha$-filtering. With all optimizations above, our system can deliver low-latency, city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Compared to existing solutions, Voyager achieves up to 6.6$\times$ speedup and 85\% energy savings with superior rendering quality."

2506.03118,"3D human reconstruction and animation are long-standing topics in computer graphics and vision. However, existing methods typically rely on sophisticated dense-view capture and/or time-consuming per-subject optimization procedures. To address these limitations, we propose HumanRAM, a novel feed-forward approach for generalizable human reconstruction and animation from monocular or sparse human images. Our approach integrates human reconstruction and animation into a unified framework by introducing explicit pose conditions, parameterized by a shared SMPL-X neural texture, into transformer-based large reconstruction models (LRM). Given monocular or sparse input images with associated camera parameters and SMPL-X poses, our model employs scalable transformers and a DPT-based decoder to synthesize realistic human renderings under novel viewpoints and novel poses. By leveraging the explicit pose conditions, our model simultaneously enables high-quality human reconstruction and high-fidelity pose-controlled animation.

In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra, including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling joint learning of all bands within a unified representation.Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)."
2506.03478,"Existing facial appearance capture methods can reconstruct plausible facial reflectance from smartphone-recorded videos. However, the reconstruction quality is still far behind the ones based on studio recordings. This paper fills the gap by developing a novel daily-used solution with a co-located smartphone and flashlight video capture setting in a dim room. To enhance the quality, our key observation is to solve facial reflectance maps within the data distribution of studio-scanned ones. Specifically, we first learn a diffusion prior over the Light Stage scans and then steer it to produce the reflectance map that best matches the captured images. We propose to train the diffusion prior at the patch level to improve generalization ability and training stability, as current Light Stage datasets are in ultra-high resolution but limited in data size. Tailored to this prior, we propose a patch-level posterior sampling technique to sample seamless full-resolution reflectance maps from this patch-level diffusion model. Experiments demonstrate our method closes the quality gap between low-cost and studio recordings by a large margin, opening the door for everyday users to clone themselves to the digital world. Our code will be released atthis https URL."
2506.03594,"Reconstructing articulated objects prevalent in daily environments is crucial for applications in augmented/virtual reality and robotics. However, existing methods face scalability limitations (requiring 3D supervision or costly annotations), robustness issues (being susceptible to local optima), and rendering shortcomings (lacking speed or photorealism). We introduce SplArt, a self-supervised, category-agnostic framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to reconstruct articulated objects and infer kinematics from two sets of posed RGB images captured at different articulation states, enabling real-time photorealistic rendering for novel viewpoints and articulations. SplArt augments 3DGS with a differentiable mobility parameter per Gaussian, achieving refined part segmentation. A multi-stage optimization strategy is employed to progressively handle reconstruction, part segmentation, and articulation estimation, significantly enhancing robustness and accuracy. SplArt exploits geometric self-supervision, effectively addressing challenging scenarios without requiring 3D annotations or category-specific priors. Evaluations on established and newly proposed benchmarks, along with applications to real-world scenarios using a handheld RGB camera, demonstrate SplArt's state-of-the-art performance and real-world practicality. Code is publicly available atthis https URL."
2506.04283,"We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles.

2506.04562,"Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free, handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh deformations."
2506.04623,"3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and semantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels: the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level, which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks: offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6 directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking 1st on the online leaderboard."
2506.04664,"This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for the polygonal approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is competitive with Rosin's measure and aesthetic aspects. The scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex insertion, iterative merging, and vertex adjustment. The initial segmentation is used to detect sharp turns, that is, vertices that seemingly have high curvature. It is likely that some of the important vertices with low curvature might have been missed in the first phase; therefore, iterative vertex insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices, and thus merging is used to eliminate redundant vertices. Finally, vertex adjustment was used to enhance the aesthetic appearance of the approximation. The quality of the approximations was measured using the Rosin's method. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric transformation was observed."
2506.04841,"This work introduces a contact interaction methodology for an unbiased treatment of contacting surfaces without assigning surfaces as master and slave. The contact tractions between interacting discrete segments are evaluated with respect to a midplane in a single pass, inherently maintaining the equilibrium of tractions. These tractions are based on the penalisation of true interpenetration between opposite surfaces, and the procedure of their integral for discrete contacting segments is described in this paper. A meticulous examination of the different possible geometric configurations of interacting 3D segments is presented to develop visual understanding and better traction evaluation accuracy. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are validated against the analytical solutions of the contact patch test, two-beam bending, Hertzian contact, and flat punch test, thus proving the capability to reproduce contact between flat surfaces, curved surfaces, and sharp corners in contact, respectively. The method passes the contact patch test with the uniform transmission of contact pressure matching the accuracy levels of finite elements. It converges towards the analytical solution with mesh refinement and a suitably high penalty factor. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm also extends to self-contact problems and has been tested for self-contact between flat and curved surfaces with inelastic material. Dynamic problems of elastic and inelastic collisions between bars, as well as oblique collisions of cylinders, are also presented. The ability of the algorithm to resolve contacts between flat and curved surfaces for nonconformal meshes with high accuracy demonstrates its versatility in general contact problems."
2506.05164,"Neurosurgery increasingly uses Mixed Reality (MR) technologies for intraoperative assistance. The greatest challenge in this area is mentally reconstructing complex 3D anatomical structures from 2D slices with millimetric precision, which is required in procedures like External Ventricular Drain (EVD) placement. MR technologies have shown great potential in improving surgical performance, however, their limited availability in clinical settings underscores the need for training systems that foster skill retention in unaided conditions. In this paper, we introduce NeuroMix, an MR-based simulator for EVD placement. We conduct a study with 48 participants to assess the impact of 2D and 3D visual aids on usability, cognitive load, technology acceptance, and procedure precision and execution time. Three training modalities are compared: one without visual aids, one with 2D aids only, and one combining both 2D and 3D aids. The training phase takes place entirely on digital objects, followed by a freehand EVD placement testing phase performed with a physical catherer and a physical phantom without MR aids. We then compare the participants performance with that of a control group that does not undergo training. Our findings show that participants trained with both 2D and 3D aids achieve a 44\% improvement in precision during unaided testing compared to the control group, substantially higher than the improvement observed in the other groups. All three training modalities receive high usability and technology acceptance ratings, with significant equivalence across groups. The combination of 2D and 3D visual aids does not significantly increase cognitive workload, though it leads to longer operation times during freehand testing compared to the control group."
2506.05268,"Randomly sampling points on surfaces is an essential operation in geometry processing. This sampling is computationally straightforward on explicit meshes, but it is much more difficult on other shape representations, such as widely-used implicit surfaces. This work studies a simple and general scheme for sampling points on a surface, which is derived from a connection to the intersections of random rays with the surface. Concretely, given a subroutine to cast a ray against a surface and find all intersections, we can use that subroutine to uniformly sample white noise points on the surface. This approach is particularly effective in the context of implicit signed distance functions, where sphere marching allows us to efficiently cast rays and sample points, without needing to extract an intermediate mesh. We analyze the basic method to show that it guarantees uniformity, and find experimentally that it is significantly more efficient than alternative strategies on a variety of representations. Furthermore, we show extensions to blue noise sampling and stratified sampling, and applications to deform neural implicit surfaces as well as moment estimation."
2506.05397,"Lack of input data for in-the-wild activities often results in low performance across various computer vision tasks. This challenge is particularly pronounced in uncommon human-centric domains like sports, where real-world data collection is complex and impractical. While synthetic datasets offer a promising alternative, existing approaches typically suffer from limited diversity in human appearance, motion, and scene composition due to their reliance on rigid asset libraries and hand-crafted rendering pipelines. To address this, we introduce Gen4D, a fully automated pipeline for generating diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations. Gen4D integrates expert-driven motion encoding, prompt-guided avatar generation using diffusion-based Gaussian splatting, and human-aware background synthesis to produce highly varied and lifelike human sequences. Based on Gen4D, we present SportPAL, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning three sports: baseball, icehockey, and soccer. Together, Gen4D and SportPAL provide a scalable foundation for constructing synthetic datasets tailored to in-the-wild human-centric vision tasks, with no need for manual 3D modeling or scene design."
2506.05398,"Diffusion models achieve realistic outcomes across a wide range of generative tasks, but their high computational cost remains a major barrier to deployment. Model pruning has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce inference cost and enable lightweight diffusion models. While effective, pruned diffusion models are proned to quality reduction due to limited capacity. A key limitation of current pruning approaches is that pruned models are finetuned using the same objective as the dense model, typically denoising score matching (DSM). Since the dense model is accessible during finetuning, it warrants a more effective approach for knowledge transfer from the dense to the pruned model. Motivated by this aim, we revisit the finetuning stage and propose IGSM (\textbf{I}mproved \textbf{G}eometric and \textbf{S}ensitivity \textbf{M}atching), a general-purpose finetuning framework that introduces a second-order Jacobian projection loss inspired by Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE). IGSM efficiently captures and aligns the geometric and the temporal dynamics of pruned models with their dense teachers using scalable second-order projections. Our approach is architecture-agnostic and applies to both U-Net- and Transformer-based diffusion models. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA, LSUN-Church, and LSUN-Bedroom show that IGSM consistently narrows the performance gap between pruned and dense models, substantially improving sample quality.

2506.05449,"The generation of high-quality 3D environments is crucial for industries such as gaming, virtual reality, and cinema, yet remains resource-intensive due to the reliance on manual processes. This study performs a systematic review of existing generative AI techniques for 3D scene generation, analyzing their characteristics, strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. By examining state-of-the-art approaches, it presents key challenges such as scene authenticity and the influence of textual inputs. Special attention is given to how AI can blend different stylistic domains while maintaining coherence, the impact of training data on output quality, and the limitations of current models. In addition, this review surveys existing evaluation metrics for assessing realism and explores how industry professionals incorporate AI into their workflows. The findings of this study aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape and serve as a foundation for future research on AI-driven 3D content generation. Key findings include that advanced generative architectures enable high-quality 3D content creation at a high computational cost, effective multi-modal integration techniques like cross-attention and latent space alignment facilitate text-to-3D tasks, and the quality and diversity of training data combined with comprehensive evaluation metrics are critical to achieving scalable, robust 3D scene generation."
2506.0548,"We introduce ODE-GS, a novel approach that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to enable future extrapolation of dynamic 3D scenes. Unlike existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods, which rely on time-conditioned deformation networks and are limited to interpolation within a fixed time window, ODE-GS eliminates timestamp dependency by modeling Gaussian parameter trajectories as continuous-time latent dynamics. Our approach first learns an interpolation model to generate accurate Gaussian trajectories within the observed window, then trains a Transformer encoder to aggregate past trajectories into a latent state evolved via a neural ODE. Finally, numerical integration produces smooth, physically plausible future Gaussian trajectories, enabling rendering at arbitrary future timestamps. On the D-NeRF, NVFi, and HyperNeRF benchmarks, ODE-GS achieves state-of-the-art extrapolation performance, improving metrics by 19.8% compared to leading baselines, demonstrating its ability to accurately represent and predict 3D scene dynamics."
2506.0593,"Direct illumination with many lights is an inherent component of physically-based rendering, remaining challenging, especially in real-time scenarios. We propose an online-trained neural cache that stores visibility between lights and 3D positions. We feed light visibility to weighted reservoir sampling (WRS) to sample a light source. The cache is implemented as a fully-fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multi-resolution hash-grid encoding, enabling online training and efficient inference on modern GPUs in real-time frame rates. The cache can be seamlessly integrated into existing rendering frameworks and can be used in combination with other real-time techniques such as spatiotemporal reservoir sampling (ReSTIR)."
2506.05935,"Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints, we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity, facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction. More information and results can be found on the pagethis https URL."
2506.0604,"In this work, we present an extension to the neural texture compression method of Weinreich and colleagues [2024]. Like them, we leverage existing block compression methods which permit to use hardware texture filtering to store a neural representation of physically-based rendering (PBR) texture sets (including albedo, normal maps, roughness, etc.). However, we show that low dynamic range block compression formats still make the solution viable. Thanks to this, we show that we can achieve higher compression ratio or higher quality at fixed compression ratio. We improve performance at runtime using a tile based rendering architecture that leverage hardware matrix multiplication engine. Thanks to all this, we render 4k textures sets (9 channels per asset) with anisotropic filtering at 1080p using only 28MB of VRAM per texture set at 0.55ms on an Intel B580."
2506.0644,"Faithfully reconstructing textured shapes and physical properties from videos presents an intriguing yet challenging problem. Significant efforts have been dedicated to advancing such a system identification problem in this area. Previous methods often rely on heavy optimization pipelines with a differentiable simulator and renderer to estimate physical parameters. However, these approaches frequently necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning for each scene and involve a costly optimization process, which limits both their practicality and generalizability. In this work, we propose a novel framework, Vid2Sim, a generalizable video-based approach for recovering geometry and physical properties through a mesh-free reduced simulation based on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), offering high computational efficiency and versatile representation capability. Specifically, Vid2Sim first reconstructs the observed configuration of the physical system from video using a feed-forward neural network trained to capture physical world knowledge. A lightweight optimization pipeline then refines the estimated appearance, geometry, and physical properties to closely align with video observations within just a few minutes. Additionally, after the reconstruction, Vid2Sim enables high-quality, mesh-free simulation with high efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in reconstructing geometry and physical properties from video data."
2506.06462,"We leverage repetitive elements in 3D scenes to improve novel view synthesis. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved novel view synthesis but renderings of unseen and occluded parts remain low-quality if the training views are not exhaustive enough. Our key observation is that our environment is often full of repetitive elements. We propose to leverage those repetitions to improve the reconstruction of low-quality parts of the scene due to poor coverage and occlusions. We propose a method that segments each repeated instance in a 3DGS reconstruction, registers them together, and allows information to be shared among instances. Our method improves the geometry while also accounting for appearance variations across instances. We demonstrate our method on a variety of synthetic and real scenes with typical repetitive elements, leading to a substantial improvement in the quality of novel view synthesis."
2506.06483,"Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion enables subject-driven image synthesis by adapting the model to generate images containing specific subjects. However, existing fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where the model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it memorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these challenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion fine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the predicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent with that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject consistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to multiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject identity while improving diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that incorporating these losses into fine-tuning not only preserves subject identity but also enhances image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in terms of CLIP scores, background variation, and overall visual quality."
2506.06494,"In parallel simulation, convergence and parallelism are often seen as inherently conflicting objectives. Improved parallelism typically entails lighter local computation and weaker coupling, which unavoidably slow the global convergence. This paper presents a novel GPU algorithm that achieves convergence rates comparable to fullspace Newton's method while maintaining good parallelizability just like the Jacobi method. Our approach is built on a key insight into the phenomenon of overshoot. Overshoot occurs when a local solver aggressively minimizes its local energy without accounting for the global context, resulting in a local update that undermines global convergence. To address this, we derive a theoretically second-order optimal solution to mitigate overshoot. Furthermore, we adapt this solution into a pre-computable form. Leveraging Cubature sampling, our runtime cost is only marginally higher than the Jacobi method, yet our algorithm converges nearly quadratically as Newton's method. We also introduce a novel full-coordinate formulation for more efficient pre-computation. Our method integrates seamlessly with the incremental potential contact method and achieves second-order convergence for both stiff and soft materials. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach delivers high-quality simulations and outperforms state-of-the-art GPU methods with 50 to 100 times better convergence."
2506.0702,"Cross fields play a critical role in various geometry processing tasks, especially for quad mesh generation. Existing methods for cross field generation often struggle to balance computational efficiency with generation quality, using slow per-shape optimization. We introduce CrossGen, a novel framework that supports both feed-forward prediction and latent generative modeling of cross fields for quad meshing by unifying geometry and cross field representations within a joint latent space. Our method enables extremely fast computation of high-quality cross fields of general input shapes, typically within one second without per-shape optimization. Our method assumes a point-sampled surface, also called a {\em point-cloud surface}, as input, so we can accommodate various surface representations by a straightforward point sampling process. Using an auto-encoder network architecture, we encode input point-cloud surfaces into a sparse voxel grid with fine-grained latent spaces, which are decoded into both SDF-based surface geometry and cross fields(see the teaser figure). We also contribute a dataset of models with both high-quality signed distance fields (SDFs) representations and their corresponding cross fields, and use it to train our network. Once trained, the network is capable of computing a cross field of an input surface in a feed-forward manner, ensuring high geometric fidelity, noise resilience, and rapid inference. Furthermore, leveraging the same unified latent representation, we incorporate a diffusion model for computing cross fields of new shapes generated from partial input, such as sketches. To demonstrate its practical applications, we validate CrossGen on the quad mesh generation task for a large variety of surface shapes. Experimental results..."
2506.07069,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained significant attention for high-quality and efficient view synthesis, making it widely adopted in fields such as AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving. Despite its impressive algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies. First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design, effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process, we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we introduce a $\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\sim27.8\times$ and energy savings of $28.8\sim51.4\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes. We plan to open-source our design to foster further development in this field."
2506.07209,"We present HOI-PAGE, a new approach to synthesizing 4D human-object interactions (HOIs) from text prompts in a zero-shot fashion, driven by part-level affordance reasoning. In contrast to prior works that focus on global, whole body-object motion for 4D HOI synthesis, we observe that generating realistic and diverse HOIs requires a finer-grained understanding -- at the level of how human body parts engage with object parts. We thus introduce Part Affordance Graphs (PAGs), a structured HOI representation distilled from large language models (LLMs) that encodes fine-grained part information along with contact relations. We then use these PAGs to guide a three-stage synthesis: first, decomposing input 3D objects into geometric parts; then, generating reference HOI videos from text prompts, from which we extract part-based motion constraints; finally, optimizing for 4D HOI motion sequences that not only mimic the reference dynamics but also satisfy part-level contact constraints. Extensive experiments show that our approach is flexible and capable of generating complex multi-object or multi-person interaction sequences, with significantly improved realism and text alignment for zero-shot 4D HOI generation."
2506.07558,"We present an effective method for visualizing flat surfaces using ray marching. Our approach provides an intuitive way to explore translation surfaces, mirror rooms, unfolded polyhedra, and translation prisms while maintaining computational efficiency.

We make our simulations and code available online."
2506.07657,"3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved remarkable success in reconstructing both static and dynamic 3D scenes. However, in a scene represented by 3D Gaussian primitives, interactions between objects suffer from inaccurate 3D segmentation, imprecise deformation among different materials, and severe rendering artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PIG: Physically-Based Multi-Material Interaction with 3D Gaussians, a novel approach that combines 3D object segmentation with the simulation of interacting objects in high precision. Firstly, our method facilitates fast and accurate mapping from 2D pixels to 3D Gaussians, enabling precise 3D object-level segmentation. Secondly, we assign unique physical properties to correspondingly segmented objects within the scene for multi-material coupled interactions. Finally, we have successfully embedded constraint scales into deformation gradients, specifically clamping the scaling and rotation properties of the Gaussian primitives to eliminate artifacts and achieve geometric fidelity and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of visual quality, but also opens up new directions and pipelines for the field of physically realistic scene generation."
2506.07897,"We present a novel approach for enhancing the resolution and geometric fidelity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) beyond native training resolution. Current 3DGS methods are fundamentally limited by their input resolution, producing reconstructions that cannot extrapolate finer details than are present in the training views. Our work breaks this limitation through a lightweight generative model that predicts and refines additional 3D Gaussians where needed most. The key innovation is our Hessian-assisted sampling strategy, which intelligently identifies regions that are likely to benefit from densification, ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike computationally intensive GANs or diffusion approaches, our method operates in real-time (0.015s per inference on a single consumer-grade GPU), making it practical for interactive applications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both geometric accuracy and rendering quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new paradigm for resolution-free 3D scene enhancement."
2506.07917,"Recent extensions of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to dynamic scenes achieve high-quality novel view synthesis by using neural networks to predict the time-varying deformation of each Gaussian. However, performing per-Gaussian neural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting rendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper, we present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general pipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS representations by reducing neural inference through two complementary techniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that identifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene reconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that improves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses. Second, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters Gaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation per group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our techniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\times$, reduce model size by $7.71\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset. SpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\times$ and $58.23\times$ on the D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets. Our methods are modular and can be integrated into any deformable 3DGS or 4DGS framework."
2506.07932,"We propose Squeeze3D, a novel framework that leverages implicit prior knowledge learnt by existing pre-trained 3D generative models to compress 3D data at extremely high compression ratios. Our approach bridges the latent spaces between a pre-trained encoder and a pre-trained generation model through trainable mapping networks. Any 3D model represented as a mesh, point cloud, or a radiance field is first encoded by the pre-trained encoder and then transformed (i.e. compressed) into a highly compact latent code. This latent code can effectively be used as an extremely compressed representation of the mesh or point cloud. A mapping network transforms the compressed latent code into the latent space of a powerful generative model, which is then conditioned to recreate the original 3D model (i.e. decompression). Squeeze3D is trained entirely on generated synthetic data and does not require any 3D datasets. The Squeeze3D architecture can be flexibly used with existing pre-trained 3D encoders and existing generative models. It can flexibly support different formats, including meshes, point clouds, and radiance fields. Our experiments demonstrate that Squeeze3D achieves compression ratios of up to 2187x for textured meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields while maintaining visual quality comparable to many existing methods. Squeeze3D only incurs a small compression and decompression latency since it does not involve training object-specific networks to compress an object."
2506.08043,"Accurate and efficient modeling of soft-tissue interactions is fundamental for advancing surgical simulation, surgical robotics, and model-based surgical automation. To achieve real-time latency, classical Finite Element Method (FEM) solvers are often replaced with neural approximations; however, naively training such models in a fully data-driven manner without incorporating physical priors frequently leads to poor generalization and physically implausible predictions. We present a novel physics-informed neural simulation framework that enables real-time prediction of soft-tissue deformations under complex single- and multi-grasper interactions. Our approach integrates Kelvinlet-based analytical priors with large-scale FEM data, capturing both linear and nonlinear tissue responses. This hybrid design improves predictive accuracy and physical plausibility across diverse neural architectures while maintaining the low-latency performance required for interactive applications. We validate our method on challenging surgical manipulation tasks involving standard laparoscopic grasping tools, demonstrating substantial improvements in deformation fidelity and temporal stability over existing baselines. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented learning as a principled and computationally efficient paradigm for real-time, physics-aware soft-tissue simulation in surgical AI."
2506.08064,"A new extended version of the altiro3D C++ Library -- initially developed to get glass-free holographic displays starting from 2D images -- is here introduced aiming to deal with 3D video streams from either 2D webcam images or flat video files. These streams are processed in real-time to synthesize light-fields (in Native format) and feed realistic 3D experiences. The core function needed to recreate multiviews consists on the use of MiDaS Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which allows to extract a depth map from a single 2D image. Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing techniques are applied to improve the overall performance of the extended altiro3D Library. Thus, altiro3D can now treat standard images, video streams or screen portions of a Desktop where other apps may be also running (like web browsers, video chats, etc) and render them into 3D. To achieve the latter, a screen region need to be selected in order to feed the output directly into a light-field 3D device such as Looking Glass (LG) Portrait.

2506.08161,"The encoding of input parameters is one of the fundamental building blocks of neural network algorithms. Its goal is to map the input data to a higher-dimensional space, typically supported by trained feature vectors. The mapping is crucial for the efficiency and approximation quality of neural networks. We propose a novel geometry-aware encoding called GATE that stores feature vectors on the surface of triangular meshes. Our encoding is suitable for neural rendering-related algorithms, for example, neural radiance caching. It also avoids limitations of previous hash-based encoding schemes, such as hash collisions, selection of resolution versus scene size, and divergent memory access. Our approach decouples feature vector density from geometry density using mesh colors, while allowing for finer control over neural network training and adaptive level-of-detail."
2506.08237,"We consider the problem of solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in domains with complex microparticle geometry that is impractical, or intractable, to model explicitly. Drawing inspiration from volume rendering, we propose tackling this problem by treating the domain as a participating medium that models microparticle geometry stochastically, through aggregate statistical properties (e.g., particle density). We first introduce the problem setting of PDE simulation in participating media. We then specialize to exponential media and describe the properties that make them an attractive model of microparticle geometry for PDE simulation problems. We use these properties to develop two new algorithms, volumetric walk on spheres and volumetric walk on stars, that generalize previous Monte Carlo algorithms to enable efficient and discretization-free simulation of linear elliptic PDEs (e.g., Laplace) in participating media. We demonstrate experimentally that our algorithms can solve Laplace boundary value problems with complex microparticle geometry more accurately and more efficiently than previous approaches, such as ensemble averaging and homogenization."
2506.08334,"Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Interactable digital twins of such objects have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. Unfortunately, current methods to digitize articulated real-world objects require carefully captured data, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable acquisition. We focus on motion analysis and part-level segmentation of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to obtain at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is challenging due to simultaneous object and camera motion and significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iTACO: a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories that is 20$\times$ larger than available in prior work. We then compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Our experiments show that iTACO outperforms existing articulated object digital twin methods on both synthetic and real casually captured RGBD videos."
2506.0835,"Modeling the full properties of light, including both amplitude and phase, in 3D representations is crucial for advancing physically plausible rendering, particularly in holographic displays. To support these features, we propose a novel representation that optimizes 3D scenes without relying on intensity-based intermediaries. We reformulate 3D Gaussian splatting with complex-valued Gaussian primitives, expanding support for rendering with light waves. By leveraging RGBD multi-view images, our method directly optimizes complex-valued Gaussians as a 3D holographic scene representation. This eliminates the need for computationally expensive hologram re-optimization. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 30x-10,000x speed improvements while maintaining on-par image quality, representing a first step towards geometrically aligned, physically plausible holographic scene representations."

In this work, we present a method for material selection in images, robust to lighting and reflectance variations, which can be used for downstream editing tasks. We rely on vision transformer (ViT) models and leverage their features for selection, proposing a multi-resolution processing strategy that yields finer and more stable selection results than prior methods. Furthermore, we enable selection at two levels: texture and subtexture, leveraging a new two-level material selection (DuMaS) dataset which includes dense annotations for over 800,000 synthetic images, both on the texture and subtexture levels."

Results show that our design achieves up to 45.7 $\times$ speedup and 62.9 $\times$ energy savings over mobile Ampere GPUs."
2506.09075,"Motion in-betweening is a crucial tool for animators, enabling intricate control over pose-level details in each keyframe. Recent machine learning solutions for motion in-betweening rely on complex models, incorporating skeleton-aware architectures or requiring multiple modules and training steps. In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective Transformer-based framework, employing a single Transformer encoder to synthesize realistic motions for motion in-betweening tasks. We find that data modeling choices play a significant role in improving in-betweening performance. Among others, we show that increasing data volume can yield equivalent or improved motion transitions, that the choice of pose representation is vital for achieving high-quality results, and that incorporating velocity input features enhances animation performance. These findings challenge the assumption that model complexity is the primary determinant of animation quality and provide insights into a more data-centric approach to motion interpolation.

2506.09909,"Neural rendering algorithms have revolutionized computer graphics, yet their impact on real-time rendering under arbitrary lighting conditions remains limited due to strict latency constraints in practical applications. The key challenge lies in formulating a compact yet expressive material representation. To address this, we propose TransGI, a novel neural rendering method for real-time, high-fidelity global illumination. It comprises an object-centric neural transfer model for material representation and a radiance-sharing lighting system for efficient illumination. Traditional BSDF representations and spatial neural material representations lack expressiveness, requiring thousands of ray evaluations to converge to noise-free colors. Conversely, real-time methods trade quality for efficiency by supporting only diffuse materials. In contrast, our object-centric neural transfer model achieves compactness and expressiveness through an MLP-based decoder and vertex-attached latent features, supporting glossy effects with low memory overhead. For dynamic, varying lighting conditions, we introduce local light probes capturing scene radiance, coupled with an across-probe radiance-sharing strategy for efficient probe generation. We implemented our method in a real-time rendering engine, combining compute shaders and CUDA-based neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves real-time performance of less than 10 ms to render a frame and significantly improved rendering quality compared to baseline methods."
2506.09997,"We introduce the Deformable Gaussian Splats Large Reconstruction Model (DGS-LRM), the first feed-forward method predicting deformable 3D Gaussian splats from a monocular posed video of any dynamic scene. Feed-forward scene reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded 3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D tracking methods."
2506.10027,"Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging. Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks. Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps for practical applications."
2506.10035,"Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs), exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs. To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability. Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon."
2506.10036,"Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern diffusion models to enhance both generation quality and alignment with input conditions. However, CFG requires specific training procedures and is limited to conditional generation. To address these limitations, we propose Token Perturbation Guidance (TPG), a novel method that applies perturbation matrices directly to intermediate token representations within the diffusion network. TPG employs a norm-preserving shuffling operation to provide effective and stable guidance signals that improve generation quality without architectural changes. As a result, TPG is training-free and agnostic to input conditions, making it readily applicable to both conditional and unconditional generation. We further analyze the guidance term provided by TPG and show that its effect on sampling more closely resembles CFG compared to existing training-free guidance techniques. Extensive experiments on SDXL and Stable Diffusion 2.1 show that TPG achieves nearly a 2$\times$ improvement in FID for unconditional generation over the SDXL baseline, while closely matching CFG in prompt alignment. These results establish TPG as a general, condition-agnostic guidance method that brings CFG-like benefits to a broader class of diffusion models."
2506.10038,"We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus limited unbiased data across diffusion times."
2506.10468,"Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1) the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system helpful for making garment purchasing decisions."
2506.10507,"Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications. We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360 enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for 2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets, enabling customizable 3D content creation."
2506.1058,"In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift RG'G and measurement offset RBS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e., seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture using sparse IMUs.

2506.11252,"2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has recently emerged as a promising method for novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction, offering better view-consistency and geometric accuracy than volumetric 3DGS. However, 2DGS suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling rates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in scenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that these artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency constraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping approach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an anti-aliased formulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits while significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our method introduces a world-space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the frequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling frequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts when zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object-space Mip filter by leveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which allows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space of each splat."
2506.11273,"We study ray reordering as a tool for increasing the performance of existing GPU ray tracing implementations. We focus on ray reordering that is fully agnostic to the particular trace kernel. We summarize the existing methods for computing the ray sorting keys and discuss their properties. We propose a novel modification of a previously proposed method using the termination point estimation that is well-suited to tracing secondary rays. We evaluate the ray reordering techniques in the context of the wavefront path tracing using the RTX trace kernels. We show that ray reordering yields significantly higher trace speed on recent GPUs (1.3-2.0x), but to recover the reordering overhead in the hardware-accelerated trace phase is problematic."
2506.1151,"We advertise the use of tetrahedral grids constructed via the longest edge bisection algorithm for rendering volumetric data with path tracing. The key benefits of such grids is two-fold. First, they provide a highly adaptive space-partitioning representation that limits the memory footprint of volumetric assets. Second, each (tetrahedral) cell has exactly 4 neighbors within the volume (one per face of each tetrahedron) or less at boundaries. We leverage these properties to devise optimized algorithms and data-structures to compute and path-trace adaptive tetrahedral grids on the GPU. In practice, our GPU implementation outperforms regular grids by up to x30 and renders production assets in real time at 32 samples per pixel."
2506.11546,"While existing video and image quality datasets have extensively studied natural videos and traditional distortions, the perception of synthetic content and modern rendering artifacts remains underexplored. We present a novel video quality dataset focused on distortions introduced by advanced rendering techniques, including neural supersampling, novel-view synthesis, path tracing, neural denoising, frame interpolation, and variable rate shading. Our evaluations show that existing full-reference quality metrics perform sub-optimally on these distortions, with a maximum Pearson correlation of 0.78. Additionally, we find that the feature space of pre-trained 3D CNNs aligns strongly with human perception of visual quality.

2506.12348,"Per-garment virtual try-on methods collect garment-specific datasets and train networks tailored to each garment to achieve superior results. However, these approaches often struggle with loose-fitting garments due to two key limitations: (1) They rely on human body semantic maps to align garments with the body, but these maps become unreliable when body contours are obscured by loose-fitting garments, resulting in degraded outcomes; (2) They train garment synthesis networks on a per-frame basis without utilizing temporal information, leading to noticeable jittering artifacts. To address the first limitation, we propose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we extract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This representation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the semantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under loose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. To address the second limitation, we introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal dependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time performance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image quality and temporal coherence. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the garment-invariant representation and the recurrent synthesis framework."
2506.12847,"Digital human video generation is gaining traction in fields like education and e-commerce, driven by advancements in head-body animation and lip-syncing technologies. However, realistic Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) - the complex dynamics between human hands and objects - continues to pose challenges. Generating natural and believable HOI reenactments is difficult due to issues such as occlusion between hands and objects, variations in object shapes and orientations, and the necessity for precise physical interactions, and importantly, the ability to generalize to unseen humans and objects. This paper presents a novel framework iDiT-HOI that enables in-the-wild HOI reenactment generation. Specifically, we propose a unified inpainting-based token process method, called Inp-TPU, with a two-stage video diffusion transformer (DiT) model. The first stage generates a key frame by inserting the designated object into the hand region, providing a reference for subsequent frames. The second stage ensures temporal coherence and fluidity in hand-object interactions. The key contribution of our method is to reuse the pretrained model's context perception capabilities without introducing additional parameters, enabling strong generalization to unseen objects and scenarios, and our proposed paradigm naturally supports long video generation. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, particularly in challenging real-world scenes, offering enhanced realism and more seamless hand-object interactions."
2506.1305,"Neural implicit shape representation has drawn significant attention in recent years due to its smoothness, differentiability, and topological flexibility. However, directly modeling the shape of a neural implicit surface, especially as the zero-level set of a neural signed distance function (SDF), with sparse geometric control is still a challenging task. Sparse input shape control typically includes 3D curve networks or, more generally, 3D curve sketches, which are unstructured and cannot be connected to form a curve network, and therefore more difficult to deal with. While 3D curve networks or curve sketches provide intuitive shape control, their sparsity and varied topology pose challenges in generating high-quality surfaces to meet such curve constraints. In this paper, we propose NeuVAS, a variational approach to shape modeling using neural implicit surfaces constrained under sparse input shape control, including unstructured 3D curve sketches as well as connected 3D curve networks. Specifically, we introduce a smoothness term based on a functional of surface curvatures to minimize shape variation of the zero-level set surface of a neural SDF. We also develop a new technique to faithfully model G0 sharp feature curves as specified in the input curve sketches. Comprehensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the significant advantages of our method."

In this work, we pave the way for spectral volume mapping, extending for the first time the functional maps framework from the surface to the volumetric setting. We show that the eigenfunctions of the volumetric Laplace operator define a functional space that is suitable for high-quality signal transfer. We also experiment with various techniques that edit this functional space, porting them to volume domains. We validate our method on novel volumetric datasets and on tetrahedralizations of well established surface datasets, also showcasing practical applications involving both discrete and continuous signal mapping, for segmentation transfer, mesh connectivity transfer and solid texturing. Last but not least, we show that considering the volumetric spectrum greatly improves the accuracy for classical shape matching tasks among surfaces, consistently outperforming existing surface-only spectral methods."

Optimization-based inverse rendering within complex capture scenarios remains however a challenging problem. A particular case is modelling complex surface light interactions for highly reflective scenes, which results in intricate high frequency specular radiance components. We hypothesize that such challenging settings can benefit from increased representation power. We hence propose a method that tackles this issue through a geometrically and physically grounded Gaussian Splatting borne radiance field, where normals and material properties are spatially variable in the primitive's local space. Using per-primitive texture maps for this purpose, we also propose to harness the GPU hardware to accelerate rendering at test time via unified material texture atlas."
2506.13814,"Graphics rendering applications increasingly leverage neural networks in tasks such as denoising, supersampling, and frame extrapolation to improve image quality while maintaining frame rates. The temporal coherence inherent in these tasks presents an opportunity to reuse intermediate results from previous frames and avoid redundant computations. Recent work has shown that caching intermediate features to be reused in subsequent inferences is an effective method to reduce latency in diffusion models. We extend this idea to real-time rendering and present ReFrame, which explores different caching policies to optimize trade-offs between quality and performance in rendering workloads. ReFrame can be applied to a variety of encoder-decoder style networks commonly found in rendering pipelines. Experimental results show that we achieve 1.4x speedup on average with negligible quality loss in three real-time rendering tasks. Code available:this https URL"
2506.13827,"Instruction-based image editing, which aims to modify the image faithfully according to the instruction while preserving irrelevant content unchanged, has made significant progress. However, there still lacks a comprehensive metric for assessing the editing quality. Existing metrics either require high human evaluation costs, which hinder large-scale evaluation, or are adapted from other tasks and lose task-specific concerns, failing to comprehensively evaluate both instruction-based modification and preservation of irrelevant regions, resulting in biased evaluation. To tackle this, we introduce a new metric called Balancing Preservation and Modification (BPM), tailored for instruction-based image editing by explicitly disentangling the image into editing-relevant and irrelevant regions for specific consideration. We first identify and locate editing-relevant regions, followed by a two-tier process to assess editing quality: Region-Aware Judge evaluates whether the position and size of the edited region align with the instruction, and Semantic-Aware Judge further assesses the instruction content compliance within editing-relevant regions as well as content preservation within irrelevant regions, yielding comprehensive and interpretable quality assessment. Moreover, the editing-relevant region localization in BPM can be integrated into image editing approaches to improve editing quality, demonstrating its broad applicability. We verify the effectiveness of the BPM metric on comprehensive instruction-editing data, and the results show the highest alignment with human evaluation compared to existing metrics, indicating its efficacy.

2506.14315,"Automatic creation of 3D scenes for immersive VR presence has been a significant research focus for decades. However, existing methods often rely on either high-poly mesh modeling with post-hoc simplification or massive 3D Gaussians, resulting in a complex pipeline or limited visual realism. In this paper, we demonstrate that such exhaustive modeling is unnecessary for achieving compelling immersive experience. We introduce ImmerseGen, a novel agent-guided framework for compact and photorealistic world modeling. ImmerseGen represents scenes as hierarchical compositions of lightweight geometric proxies, i.e., simplified terrain and billboard meshes, and generates photorealistic appearance by synthesizing RGBA textures onto these proxies. Specifically, we propose terrain-conditioned texturing for user-centric base world synthesis, and RGBA asset texturing for midground and foreground scenery. This reformulation offers several advantages: (i) it simplifies modeling by enabling agents to guide generative models in producing coherent textures that integrate seamlessly with the scene; (ii) it bypasses complex geometry creation and decimation by directly synthesizing photorealistic textures on proxies, preserving visual quality without degradation; (iii) it enables compact representations suitable for real-time rendering on mobile VR headsets. To automate scene creation from text prompts, we introduce VLM-based modeling agents enhanced with semantic grid-based analysis for improved spatial reasoning and accurate asset placement. ImmerseGen further enriches scenes with dynamic effects and ambient audio to support multisensory immersion. Experiments on scene generation and live VR showcases demonstrate that ImmerseGen achieves superior photorealism, spatial coherence and rendering efficiency compared to prior methods.

The proposed framework, called GHAR, is implemented for architectural building models. It augments virtual CAD models of buildings on the ground, enabling users to manipulate and visualize an architectural model before actual construction. The system offers a quick view of the building infrastructure, playing a vital role in requirement analysis and planning in construction technology. We evaluated the usability, manipulability, and comprehensibility of the proposed system using a standard user study with the System Usability Scale (SUS) and Handheld Augmented Reality User Study (HARUS). We compared our GeoPose-based markerless HAR framework with a marker-based HAR framework, finding significant improvement in the aforementioned three parameters with the markerless framework."
2506.14714,"For decades, efficient real-time skinning methods have played a crucial role in animating character rigs for visual effects and games. These methods remain a fundamental component of modern applications. However, animatable digital asset creation predominantly remains a manual process. Current automated tools often fall short of delivering the desired level of quality for intricate and complex geometries, requiring manual touch-ups. We propose a fully automatic and robust method for generating high quality skinning weights given a user-provided skeleton and mesh in A- or T-pose. Notably, our approach provides direct sparsity controls, limiting the number of bone influences per vertex, which is essential for efficient asset creation for large-scale mobile experiences with multiple concurrent users. Our method additionally addresses the need for level-of-detail (LoD) variations in performance-sensitive applications, which are exacerbated on mobile platforms. By optimizing weights in space rather than on discrete points, we enable a single optimization result to be seamlessly applied to all levels of detail of that asset or even variations of that asset. To achieve this, we introduce a novel parameterized family of functions called SkinCells. We demonstrate how our automatic method is able to robustly compute skinning weights in cases where biharmonic weight computation fails."

In this paper, we present Garment Inertial Poser (GaIP), a method for estimating full-body poses from sparse and loosely attached IMU sensors. We first simulate IMU recordings using an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. Our transformer-based diffusion models synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses from this challenging loose IMU data. We also demonstrate that incorporating garment-related parameters during training on loose IMU data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Our experiments show that our diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperform state-of-the-art inertial full-body pose estimators, both quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research on motion capture from such realistic sensor placements."
2506.15312,"Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes, expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at:this https URL"
2506.15684,"Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in 3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards. Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking, Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting within a few finetuning steps."
2506.15742,"We present evaluation results for FLUX.1 Kontext, a generative flow matching model that unifies image generation and editing. The model generates novel output views by incorporating semantic context from text and image inputs. Using a simple sequence concatenation approach, FLUX.1 Kontext handles both local editing and generative in-context tasks within a single unified architecture. Compared to current editing models that exhibit degradation in character consistency and stability across multiple turns, we observe that FLUX.1 Kontext improved preservation of objects and characters, leading to greater robustness in iterative workflows. The model achieves competitive performance with current state-of-the-art systems while delivering significantly faster generation times, enabling interactive applications and rapid prototyping workflows. To validate these improvements, we introduce KontextBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 1026 image-prompt pairs covering five task categories: local editing, global editing, character reference, style reference and text editing. Detailed evaluations show the superior performance of FLUX.1 Kontext in terms of both single-turn quality and multi-turn consistency, setting new standards for unified image processing models."
2506.15786,"Computer graphics, often associated with films, games, and visual effects, has long been a powerful tool for addressing scientific challenges--from its origins in 3D visualization for medical imaging to its role in modern computational modeling and simulation. This course explores the deep and evolving relationship between computer graphics and science, highlighting past achievements, ongoing contributions, and open questions that remain. We show how core methods, such as geometric reasoning and physical modeling, provide inductive biases that help address challenges in both fields, especially in data-scarce settings. To that end, we aim to reframe graphics as a modeling language for science by bridging vocabulary gaps between the two communities. Designed for both newcomers and experts, Graphics4Science invites the graphics community to engage with science, tackle high-impact problems where graphics expertise can make a difference, and contribute to the future of scientific discovery.

2506.15815,"Structural coloration is commonly modeled using wave optics for reliable and photorealistic rendering of natural, quasi-periodic and complex nanostructures. Such models often rely on dense, preliminary or preprocessed data to accurately capture the nuanced variations in diffractive surface reflectances. This heavy data dependency warrants implicit neural representation which has not been addressed comprehensively in the current literature. In this paper, we present a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based method for data-driven rendering of diffractive surfaces with high accuracy and efficiency. We primarily approach this problem from a data compression perspective to devise a nuanced training and modeling method which is attuned to the domain and range characteristics of diffractive reflectance datasets. Importantly, our approach avoids over-fitting and has robust resampling behavior. Using Peak-Signal-to-Noise (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and a flipping difference evaluator (FLIP) as evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the high-quality reconstruction of the ground-truth. In comparison to a recent state-of-the-art offline, wave-optical, forward modeling approach, our method reproduces subjectively similar results with significant performance gains. We reduce the memory footprint of the raw datasets by two orders of magnitude in general. Lastly, we depict the working of our method with actual surface renderings."
2506.15821,"Recent advances in Novel View Synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation have significantly improved editing tasks, with a primary emphasis on maintaining cross-view consistency throughout the generative process. Contemporary methods typically address this challenge using a dual-strategy framework: performing consistent 2D inpainting across all views guided by embedded priors either explicitly in pixel space or implicitly in latent space; and conducting 3D reconstruction with additional consistency guidance. Previous strategies, in particular, often require an initial 3D reconstruction phase to establish geometric structure, introducing considerable computational overhead. Even with the added cost, the resulting reconstruction quality often remains suboptimal. In this paper, we present VEIGAR, a computationally efficient framework that outperforms existing methods without relying on an initial reconstruction phase. VEIGAR leverages a lightweight foundation model to reliably align priors explicitly in the pixel space. In addition, we introduce a novel supervision strategy based on scale-invariant depth loss, which removes the need for traditional scale-and-shift operations in monocular depth regularization. Through extensive experimentation, VEIGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark in reconstruction quality and cross-view consistency, while achieving a threefold reduction in training time compared to the fastest existing method, highlighting its superior balance of efficiency and effectiveness."
2506.1586,"Visual analysis of relational data is essential for many real-world analytics tasks, with layout quality being key to interpretability. However, existing layout algorithms often require users to navigate complex parameters to express their intent. We present a user-guided force-directed layout approach that enables intuitive control through freehand sketching. Our method uses classical image analysis techniques to extract structural information from sketches, which is then used to generate positional constraints that guide the layout process. We evaluate the approach on various real and synthetic graphs ranging from small to medium scale, demonstrating its ability to produce layouts aligned with user expectations. An implementation of our method along with documentation and a demo page is freely available on GitHub atthis https URL."
2506.16627,"Neural signed-distance fields (SDFs) are a versatile backbone for neural geometry representation, but enforcing CAD-style developability usually requires Gaussian-curvature penalties with full Hessian evaluation and second-order differentiation, which are costly in memory and time. We introduce an off-diagonal Weingarten loss that regularizes only the mixed shape operator term that represents the gap between principal curvatures and flattens the surface. We present two variants: a finite-difference version using six SDF evaluations plus one gradient, and an auto-diff version using a single Hessian-vector product. Both converge to the exact mixed term and preserve the intended geometric properties without assembling the full Hessian. On the ABC benchmarks the losses match or exceed Hessian-based baselines while cutting GPU memory and training time by roughly a factor of two. The method is drop-in and framework-agnostic, enabling scalable curvature-aware SDF learning for engineering-grade shape reconstruction. Our code is available atthis https URL."
2506.16827,"We propose a novel PDE-driven corruption process for generative image synthesis based on advection-diffusion processes which generalizes existing PDE-based approaches. Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet, Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence, we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis."
2506.17206,"3D panorama synthesis is a promising yet challenging task that demands high-quality and diverse visual appearance and geometry of the generated omnidirectional content. Existing methods leverage rich image priors from pre-trained 2D foundation models to circumvent the scarcity of 3D panoramic data, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits their effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane synchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities can be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain. Based on this design, we further introduce DreamCube, a multi-plane RGB-D diffusion model for 3D panorama generation, which maximizes the reuse of 2D foundation model priors to achieve diverse appearances and accurate geometry while maintaining multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in panoramic image generation, panoramic depth estimation, and 3D scene generation."
2506.17301,"Generating controllable character animation from a reference image and motion guidance remains a challenging task due to the inherent difficulty of injecting appearance and motion cues into video diffusion models. Prior works often rely on complex architectures, explicit guider modules, or multi-stage processing pipelines, which increase structural overhead and hinder deployment. Inspired by the strong visual context modeling capacity of pre-trained video diffusion transformers, we propose FramePrompt, a minimalist yet powerful framework that treats reference images, skeleton-guided motion, and target video clips as a unified visual sequence. By reformulating animation as a conditional future prediction task, we bypass the need for guider networks and structural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms representative baselines across various evaluation metrics while also simplifying training. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of sequence-level visual conditioning and demonstrate the potential of pre-trained models for controllable animation without architectural changes."
2506.17636,"Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have made significant advances in surface reconstruction. However, scaling these methods to large-scale scenes remains challenging due to high computational demands and the complex dynamic appearances typical of outdoor environments. These challenges hinder the application in aerial surveying and autonomous driving. This paper proposes a novel solution to reconstruct large-scale surfaces with fine details, supervised by full-sized images. Firstly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy to reconstruct a coarse model efficiently, followed by adaptive scene partitioning and sub-scene refining from image segments. Additionally, we integrate a decoupling appearance model to capture global appearance variations and a transient mask model to mitigate interference from moving objects. Finally, we expand the multi-view constraint and introduce a single-view regularization for texture-less areas. Our experiments were conducted on the publicly available dataset GauU-Scene V2, which was captured using unmanned aerial vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms existing NeRF-based and Gaussian-based methods, achieving high-fidelity visual results and accurate surface from full-size image optimization. Open-source code will be available on GitHub."
2506.1777,"Recent advances in texture compression provide major improvements in compression ratios, but cannot use the GPU's texture units for decompression and filtering. This has led to the development of stochastic texture filtering (STF) techniques to avoid the high cost of multiple texel evaluations with such formats. Unfortunately, those methods can give undesirable visual appearance changes under magnification and may contain visible noise and flicker despite the use of spatiotemporal denoisers. Recent work substantially improves the quality of magnification filtering with STF by sharing decoded texel values between nearby pixels (Wronski 2025). Using GPU wave communication intrinsics, this sharing can be performed inside actively executing shaders without memory traffic overhead. We take this idea further and present novel algorithms that use wave communication between lanes to avoid repeated texel decompression prior to filtering. By distributing unique work across lanes, we can achieve zero-error filtering using <=1 texel evaluations per pixel given a sufficiently large magnification factor. For the remaining cases, we propose novel filtering fallback methods that also achieve higher quality than prior approaches."
2506.18017,"Surface cutting is a fundamental task in computer graphics, with applications in UV parameterization, texture mapping, and mesh decomposition. However, existing methods often produce technically valid but overly fragmented atlases that lack semantic coherence. We introduce SeamGPT, an auto-regressive model that generates cutting seams by mimicking professional workflows. Our key technical innovation lies in formulating surface cutting as a next token prediction task: sample point clouds on mesh vertices and edges, encode them as shape conditions, and employ a GPT-style transformer to sequentially predict seam segments with quantized 3D coordinates. Our approach achieves exceptional performance on UV unwrapping benchmarks containing both manifold and non-manifold meshes, including artist-created, and 3D-scanned models. In addition, it enhances existing 3D segmentation tools by providing clean boundaries for part decomposition."
2506.18251,"In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for accelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies. Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type, but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot models, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a lossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling step budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with consistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image synthesis.

2506.18407,"Direct volume rendering (DVR) is a fundamental technique for visualizing volumetric data, where transfer functions (TFs) play a crucial role in extracting meaningful structures. However, designing effective TFs remains unintuitive due to the semantic gap between user intent and TF parameter space. Although numerous TF optimization methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, existing approaches still face two major challenges: the vast exploration space and limited generalizability. To address these issues, we propose IntuiTF, a novel framework that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to guide TF optimization in alignment with user intent. Specifically, our method consists of two key components: (1) an evolution-driven explorer for effective exploration of the TF space, and (2) an MLLM-guided human-aligned evaluator that provides generalizable visual feedback on rendering quality. The explorer and the evaluator together establish an efficient Trial-Insight-Replanning paradigm for TF space exploration. We further extend our framework with an interactive TF design system. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our framework through three case studies and validate the effectiveness of each component through extensive experiments. We strongly recommend readers check our cases, demo video, and source code at:this https URL"
2506.18601,"Transforming casually captured, monocular videos into fully immersive dynamic experiences is a highly ill-posed task, and comes with significant challenges, e.g., reconstructing unseen regions, and dealing with the ambiguity in monocular depth estimation. In this work we introduce BulletGen, an approach that takes advantage of generative models to correct errors and complete missing information in a Gaussian-based dynamic scene representation. This is done by aligning the output of a diffusion-based video generation model with the 4D reconstruction at a single frozen ""bullet-time"" step. The generated frames are then used to supervise the optimization of the 4D Gaussian model. Our method seamlessly blends generative content with both static and dynamic scene components, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel-view synthesis, and 2D/3D tracking tasks."
2506.1868,"We present DuetGen, a novel framework for generating interactive two-person dances from music. The key challenge of this task lies in the inherent complexities of two-person dance interactions, where the partners need to synchronize both with each other and with the music. Inspired by the recent advances in motion synthesis, we propose a two-stage solution: encoding two-person motions into discrete tokens and then generating these tokens from music. To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both dancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and adopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages. Our first stage utilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at a coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution, producing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels. Subsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to map music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level semantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic tokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to predict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to iteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during inference. Through the hierarchical masked modeling and dedicated interaction representation, DuetGen achieves the generation of synchronized and interactive two-person dances across various genres. Extensive experiments and user studies on a benchmark duet dance dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of DuetGen in motion realism, music-dance alignment, and partner coordination."
2506.18867,"We present a B-spline finite element method (FEM) for cloth simulation. Building on quadratic B-spline basis functions, our method provides a globally $C^1$-continuous displacement field, enabling consistent and accurate discretization of both membrane and bending energies. This smooth representation effectively mitigates locking artifacts and mesh dependency issues commonly observed with linear FEM. To further improve efficiency, we develop a reduced integration scheme that separately optimizes quadrature rules for membrane and bending energies, further reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, demonstrating improved accuracy, visual quality, and efficiency compared to linear FEM and recent higher-order methods. Our method enables realistic simulation of complex wrinkling dynamics across varying material parameters, offering a promising new spatial discretization for cloth simulation."
2506.19084,"G-SYNC technology matches formerly regular display refreshes to irregular frame updates, improving frame rates and interactive latency. In a previous study of gaming at the 30Hz frame rates common on consoles, players of Battlefield 4 were unable to discern when G-SYNC was in use, but scored higher with G-SYNC and were affected emotionally. We build on that study with the first examination of G-SYNC's effects at the 60Hz frame rate more common in PC gaming and on emerging consoles. Though G-SYNC's effects are less at 60Hz than they were at 30Hz, G-SYNC can still improve the performance of veteran players, particularly when games are challenging. G-SYNC's effects on emotion and experience were limited."
2506.19139,"Recent advances in 3D Gaussian representations have significantly improved the quality and efficiency of image-based scene reconstruction. Their explicit nature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting accurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments - remains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth estimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and limit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude. As demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher reconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a factor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction."
2506.19278,"The revolutionary advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has fundamentally transformed the landscape of visual content creation and artistic expression. While remarkable progress has been made in image generation and style transfer, the underlying mechanisms and aesthetic implications of these technologies remain insufficiently understood. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AIGC technologies in visual arts, tracing their evolution from early algorithmic frameworks to contemporary deep generative models. We identify three pivotal paradigms: Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Diffusion Models, and examine their roles in bridging the gap between human creativity and machine synthesis. To support our analysis, we systematically review over 500 research papers published in the past decade, spanning both foundational developments and state-of-the-art innovations. Furthermore, we propose a multidimensional evaluation framework that incorporates Technical Innovation, Artistic Merit, Visual Quality, Computational Efficiency, and Creative Potential. Our findings reveal both the transformative capacities and current limitations of AIGC systems, emphasizing their profound impact on the future of creative practices. Through this extensive synthesis, we offer a unified perspective on the convergence of artificial intelligence and artistic expression, while outlining key challenges and promising directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field."
2506.194,"We introduce continuous indexed points for improved multivariate volume visualization. Indexed points represent linear structures in parallel coordinates and can be used to encode local correlation of multivariate (including multifield, multifaceted, and multiattribute) volume data. First, we perform local linear fitting in the spatial neighborhood of each volume sample using principal component analysis, accelerated by hierarchical spatial data structures. This local linear information is then visualized as continuous indexed points in parallel coordinates: a density representation of indexed points in a continuous domain. With our new method, multivariate volume data can be analyzed using the eigenvector information from local spatial embeddings. We utilize both 1-flat and 2-flat indexed points, allowing us to identify correlations between two variables and even three variables, respectively. An interactive occlusion shading model facilitates good spatial perception of the volume rendering of volumetric correlation characteristics. Interactive exploration is supported by specifically designed multivariate transfer function widgets working in the image plane of parallel coordinates. We show that our generic technique works for multi-attribute datasets. The effectiveness and usefulness of our new method is demonstrated through a case study, an expert user study, and domain expert feedback."
2506.19415,"3D Gaussian Splatting represents a breakthrough in the field of novel view synthesis. It establishes Gaussians as core rendering primitives for highly accurate real-world environment reconstruction. Recent advances have drastically increased the size of scenes that can be created. In this work, we present a method for rendering large and complex 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes using virtual memory. By leveraging well-established virtual memory and virtual texturing techniques, our approach efficiently identifies visible Gaussians and dynamically streams them to the GPU just in time for real-time rendering. Selecting only the necessary Gaussians for both storage and rendering results in reduced memory usage and effectively accelerates rendering, especially for highly complex scenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how level of detail can be integrated into our proposed method to further enhance rendering speed for large-scale scenes. With an optimized implementation, we highlight key practical considerations and thoroughly evaluate the proposed technique and its impact on desktop and mobile devices."
2506.19708,"Despite their impressive performance, generative image models trained on large-scale datasets frequently fail to produce images with seemingly simple concepts -- e.g., human hands or objects appearing in groups of four -- that are reasonably expected to appear in the training data. These failure modes have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and characterizing ""conceptual blindspots"" -- concepts present in the training data but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings, enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with 32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models (Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying data-generating process."
2506.20202,"With the advancement of Gaussian Splatting techniques, a growing number of datasets based on this representation have been developed. However, performing accurate and efficient clipping for Gaussian Splatting remains a challenging and unresolved problem, primarily due to the volumetric nature of Gaussian primitives, which makes hard clipping incapable of precisely localizing their pixel-level contributions. In this paper, we propose a hybrid rendering framework that combines rasterization and ray tracing to achieve efficient and high-fidelity clipping of Gaussian Splatting data. At the core of our method is the RaRa strategy, which first leverages rasterization to quickly identify Gaussians intersected by the clipping plane, followed by ray tracing to compute attenuation weights based on their partial occlusion. These weights are then used to accurately estimate each Gaussian's contribution to the final image, enabling smooth and continuous clipping effects. We validate our approach on diverse datasets, including general Gaussians, hair strand Gaussians, and multi-layer Gaussians, and conduct user studies to evaluate both perceptual quality and quantitative performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method delivers visually superior results while maintaining real-time rendering performance and preserving high fidelity in the unclipped regions."
2506.20267,"Interpretable models are crucial for supporting clinical decision-making, driving advances in their development and application for medical images. However, the nature of 3D volumetric data makes it inherently challenging to visualize and interpret intricate and complex structures like the cerebral cortex. Cortical surface renderings, on the other hand, provide a more accessible and understandable 3D representation of brain anatomy, facilitating visualization and interactive exploration. Motivated by this advantage and the widespread use of surface data for studying neurological disorders, we present the eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer (X-SiT). This is the first inherently interpretable neural network that offers human-understandable predictions based on interpretable cortical features. As part of X-SiT, we introduce a prototypical surface patch decoder for classifying surface patch embeddings, incorporating case-based reasoning with spatially corresponding cortical prototypes. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in detecting Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia while additionally providing informative prototypes that align with known disease patterns and reveal classification errors."
2506.20367,"Recent advances in text-to-3D scene generation have demonstrated significant potential to transform content creation across multiple industries. Although the research community has made impressive progress in addressing the challenges of this complex task, existing methods often generate environments that are only front-facing, lack visual fidelity, exhibit limited scene understanding, and are typically fine-tuned for either indoor or outdoor settings. In this work, we address these issues and propose DreamAnywhere, a modular system for the fast generation and prototyping of 3D scenes. Our system synthesizes a 360° panoramic image from text, decomposes it into background and objects, constructs a complete 3D representation through hybrid inpainting, and lifts object masks to detailed 3D objects that are placed in the virtual environment. DreamAnywhere supports immersive navigation and intuitive object-level editing, making it ideal for scene exploration, visual mock-ups, and rapid prototyping -- all with minimal manual modeling. These features make our system particularly suitable for low-budget movie production, enabling quick iteration on scene layout and visual tone without the overhead of traditional 3D workflows. Our modular pipeline is highly customizable as it allows components to be replaced independently. Compared to current state-of-the-art text and image-based 3D scene generation approaches, DreamAnywhere shows significant improvements in coherence in novel view synthesis and achieves competitive image quality, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse and challenging scenarios. A comprehensive user study demonstrates a clear preference for our method over existing approaches, validating both its technical robustness and practical usefulness."
2506.20652,"We present EditP23, a method for mask-free 3D editing that propagates 2D image edits to multi-view representations in a 3D-consistent manner. In contrast to traditional approaches that rely on text-based prompting or explicit spatial masks, EditP23 enables intuitive edits by conditioning on a pair of images: an original view and its user-edited counterpart. These image prompts are used to guide an edit-aware flow in the latent space of a pre-trained multi-view diffusion model, allowing the edit to be coherently propagated across views. Our method operates in a feed-forward manner, without optimization, and preserves the identity of the original object, in both structure and appearance. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a range of object categories and editing scenarios, achieving high fidelity to the source while requiring no manual masks."
2506.20703,"We describe Generative Blocks World to interact with the scene of a generated image by manipulating simple geometric abstractions. Our method represents scenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be represented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move either whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been edited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on depth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D primitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value caching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera moves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization."
2506.20875,"We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image synthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing.

This systematic review analyzes 37 research papers exploring the use of data visualization and visual analytics in financial education and literacy enhancement. We classify these studies into five key areas: (1) the evolution of visualization use across time and space, (2) motivations for using visualization tools, (3) the financial topics addressed and instructional approaches used, (4) the types of tools and technologies applied, and (5) how the effectiveness of teaching interventions was evaluated. Furthermore, we identify research gaps and highlight opportunities for advancing financial literacy.

Our approach incorporates geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures. Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both visual quality and temporal coherence."
2506.21272,"We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings, character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second stage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen identity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent video scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful, narratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for personalized and engaging story animation.

2506.21425,"Traffic anomalies and attacks are commonplace in today's networks and identifying them rapidly and accurately is critical for large network operators. For a statistical intrusion detection system (IDS), it is crucial to detect at the flow-level for accurate detection and mitigation. However, existing IDS systems offer only limited support for 1) interactively examining detected intrusions and anomalies, 2) analyzing worm propagation patterns, 3) and discovering correlated attacks. These problems are becoming even more acute as the traffic on today's high-speed routers continues to grow.IDGraphs is an interactive visualization system for intrusion detection that addresses these challenges. The central visualization in the system is a flow-level trace plotted with time on the horizontal axis and aggregated number of unsuccessful connections on the vertical axis. We then summarize a stack of tens or hundreds of thousands of these traces using the Histographs [RW05] technique, which maps data frequency at each pixel to brightness. Users may then interactively query the summary view, performing analysis by highlighting subsets of the traces. For example, brushing a linked correlation matrix view highlights traces with similar patterns, revealing distributed attacks that are difficult to detect using standard statistical analysis.We apply IDGraphs system to a real network router data-set with 179M flow-level records representing a total traffic of 1.16TB. The system successfully detects and analyzes a variety of attacks and anomalies, including port scanning, worm outbreaks, stealthy TCP SYN floodings, and some distributed attacks."
2506.21629,"In recent years, neural rendering methods such as NeRFs and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made significant progress in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, they heavily rely on preprocessed camera poses and 3D structural priors from structure-from-motion (SfM), which are challenging to obtain in outdoor scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose to incorporate Iterative Closest Point (ICP) with optimization-based refinement to achieve accurate camera pose estimation under large camera movements. Additionally, we introduce a voxel-based scene densification approach to guide the reconstruction in large-scale scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our approach ICP-3DGS outperforms existing methods in both camera pose estimation and novel view synthesis across indoor and outdoor scenes of various scales.

2506.21632,"Reconstructing an interactive human avatar and the background from a monocular video of a dynamic human scene is highly challenging. In this work we adopt a strategy of point cloud decoupling and joint optimization to achieve the decoupled reconstruction of backgrounds and human bodies while preserving the interactivity of human motion. We introduce a position texture to subdivide the Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) body model's surface and grow the human point cloud. To capture fine details of human dynamics and deformations, we incorporate a convolutional neural network structure to predict human body point cloud features based on texture. This strategy makes our approach free of hyperparameter tuning for densification and efficiently represents human points with half the point cloud of HUGS. This approach ensures high-quality human reconstruction and reduces GPU resource consumption during training. As a result, our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art HUGS in reconstruction metrics while maintaining the ability to generalize to novel poses and views. Furthermore, our technique achieves real-time rendering at over 100 FPS, $\sim$6$\times$ the HUGS speed using only Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) weights for human transformation. Additionally, this work demonstrates that this framework can be extended to animal scene reconstruction when an accurately-posed model of an animal is available."
2506.21633,"Three-dimensional target reconstruction from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for interpreting complex scattering information in SAR data. However, the intricate electromagnetic scattering mechanisms inherent to SAR imaging pose significant reconstruction challenges. Inspired by the remarkable success of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) in optical domain reconstruction, this paper presents a novel SAR Differentiable Gaussian Splatting Rasterizer (SDGR) specifically designed for SAR target reconstruction. Our approach combines Gaussian splatting with the Mapping and Projection Algorithm to compute scattering intensities of Gaussian primitives and generate simulated SAR images through SDGR. Subsequently, the loss function between the rendered image and the ground truth image is computed to optimize the Gaussian primitive parameters representing the scene, while a custom CUDA gradient flow is employed to replace automatic differentiation for accelerated gradient computation. Through experiments involving the rendering of simplified architectural targets and SAR images of multiple vehicle targets, we validate the imaging rationality of SDGR on simulated SAR imagery. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our method for target reconstruction is demonstrated on both simulated and real-world datasets containing multiple vehicle targets, with quantitative evaluations conducted to assess its reconstruction performance. Experimental results indicate that our approach can effectively reconstruct the geometric structures and scattering properties of targets, thereby providing a novel solution for 3D reconstruction in the field of SAR imaging."
2506.2225,"We present a design space for animated transitions of the appearance of 3D spatial datasets in a hybrid Augmented Reality (AR)-desktop context. Such hybrid interfaces combine both traditional and immersive displays to facilitate the exploration of 2D and 3D data representations in the environment in which they are best displayed. One key aspect is to introduce transitional animations that change between the different dimensionalities to illustrate the connection between the different representations and to reduce the potential cognitive load on the user. The specific transitions to be used depend on the type of data, the needs of the application domain, and other factors. We summarize these as a transition design space to simplify the decision-making process and provide inspiration for future designs. First, we discuss 3D visualizations from a spatial perspective: a spatial encoding pipeline, where 3D data sampled from the physical world goes through various transformations, being mapped to visual representations, and then being integrated into a hybrid AR-desktop environment. The transition design then focuses on interpolating between two spatial encoding pipelines to provide a smooth experience. To illustrate the use of our design space, we apply it to three case studies that focus on applications in astronomy, radiology, and chemistry; we then discuss lessons learned from these applications."
2506.22799,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become horsepower in high-quality, real-time rendering for novel view synthesis of 3D scenes. However, existing methods focus primarily on geometric and appearance modeling, lacking deeper scene understanding while also incurring high training costs that complicate the originally streamlined differentiable rendering pipeline. To this end, we propose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates Hough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized for instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We then embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets construct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth distortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis. For open-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D point clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with high-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D instance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object localization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies.

2506.22849,"Oriented bounding box (OBB) bounding volume hierarchies offer a more precise fit than axis-aligned bounding box hierarchies in scenarios with thin elongated and arbitrarily rotated geometry, enhancing intersection test performance in ray tracing. However, determining optimally oriented bounding boxes can be computationally expensive and have high memory requirements. Recent research has shown that pre-built hierarchies can be efficiently converted to OBB hierarchies on the GPU in a bottom-up pass, yielding significant ray tracing traversal improvements. In this paper, we introduce a novel OBB construction technique where all internal node children share a consistent OBB transform, chosen from a fixed set of discrete quantized rotations. This allows for efficient encoding and reduces the computational complexity of OBB transformations. We further extend our approach to hierarchies with multiple children per node by leveraging Discrete Orientation Polytopes (k-DOPs), demonstrating improvements in traversal performance while limiting the build time impact for real-time applications. Our method is applied as a post-processing step, integrating seamlessly into existing hierarchy construction pipelines. Despite a 12.6% increase in build time, our experimental results demonstrate an average improvement of 18.5% in primary, 32.4% in secondary rays, and maximum gain of 65% in ray intersection performance, highlighting its potential for advancing real-time applications."
2506.22973,"3D Gaussian Splatting enables high-quality real-time rendering but often produces millions of splats, resulting in excessive storage and computational overhead. We propose a novel lossy compression method based on learnable confidence scores modeled as Beta distributions. Each splat's confidence is optimized through reconstruction-aware losses, enabling pruning of low-confidence splats while preserving visual fidelity. The proposed approach is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to any Gaussian Splatting variant. In addition, the average confidence values serve as a new metric to assess the quality of the scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate favorable trade-offs between compression and fidelity compared to prior work. Our code and data are publicly available atthis https URL"

2506.23092,"Many scientific and engineering problems involving multi-physics span a wide range of scales. Understanding the interactions across these scales is essential for fully comprehending such complex problems. However, visualizing multivariate, multiscale data within an integrated view where correlations across space, scales, and fields are easily perceived remains challenging. To address this, we introduce a novel local spatial statistical visualization of flow fields across multiple fields and turbulence scales. Our method leverages the curvelet transform for scale decomposition of fields of interest, a level-set-restricted centroidal Voronoi tessellation to partition the spatial domain into local regions for statistical aggregation, and a set of glyph designs that combines information across scales and fields into a single, or reduced set of perceivable visual representations. Each glyph represents data aggregated within a Voronoi region and is positioned at the Voronoi site for direct visualization in a 3D view centered around flow features of interest. We implement and integrate our method into an interactive visualization system where the glyph-based technique operates in tandem with linked 3D spatial views and 2D statistical views, supporting a holistic analysis. We demonstrate with case studies visualizing turbulent combustion data--multi-scalar compressible flows--and turbulent incompressible channel flow data. This new capability enables scientists to better understand the interactions between multiple fields and length scales in turbulent flows."
2506.23364,"We present interactive data-driven compute overlays for native and web-based 3D geographic map applications based on WebGPU. Our data-driven overlays are generated in a multi-step compute workflow from multiple data sources on the GPU. We demonstrate their potential by showing results from snow cover and avalanche simulations, where simulation parameters can be adjusted interactively and results are visualized instantly. Benchmarks show that our approach can compute large-scale avalanche simulations in milliseconds to seconds, depending on the size of the terrain and the simulation parameters, which is multiple orders of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art Python implementation."
2506.23388,"We present a real-time deformation method for Escher tiles -- interlocking organic forms that seamlessly tessellate the plane following symmetry rules. We formulate the problem as determining a periodic displacement field. The goal is to deform Escher tiles without introducing gaps or overlaps. The resulting displacement field is obtained in closed form by an analytical solution. Our method processes tiles of 17 wallpaper groups across various representations such as images and meshes. Rather than treating tiles as mere boundaries, we consider them as textured shapes, ensuring that both the boundary and interior deform simultaneously. To enable fine-grained artistic input, our interactive tool features a user-controllable adaptive fall-off parameter, allowing precise adjustment of locality and supporting deformations with meaningful semantic control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through various examples, including photo editing and shape sculpting, showing its use in applications such as fabrication and animation."
2506.23406,"The analysis of 3D symmetric second-order tensor fields often relies on topological features such as degenerate tensor lines, neutral surfaces, and their generalization to mode surfaces, which reveal important structural insights into the data. However, uncertainty in such fields is typically visualized using derived scalar attributes or tensor glyph representations, which often fail to capture the global behavior. Recent advances have introduced uncertain topological features for tensor field ensembles by focusing on degenerate tensor locations. Yet, mode surfaces, including neutral surfaces and arbitrary mode surfaces are essential to a comprehensive understanding of tensor field topology. In this work, we present a generalization of uncertain degenerate tensor features to uncertain mode surfaces of arbitrary mode values, encompassing uncertain degenerate tensor lines as a special case. Our approach supports both surface and line geometries, forming a unified framework for analyzing uncertain mode-based topological features in tensor field ensembles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several real-world simulation datasets from engineering and materials science."
2506.23777,"The creation of virtual humans increasingly leverages automated synthesis of speech and gestures, enabling expressive, adaptable agents that effectively engage users. However, the independent development of voice and gesture generation technologies, alongside the growing popularity of virtual reality (VR), presents significant questions about the integration of these signals and their ability to convey emotional detail in immersive environments. In this paper, we evaluate the influence of real and synthetic gestures and speech, alongside varying levels of immersion (VR vs. 2D displays) and emotional contexts (positive, neutral, negative) on user perceptions. We investigate how immersion affects the perceived match between gestures and speech and the impact on key aspects of user experience, including emotional and empathetic responses and the sense of co-presence. Our findings indicate that while VR enhances the perception of natural gesture-voice pairings, it does not similarly improve synthetic ones - amplifying the perceptual gap between them. These results highlight the need to reassess gesture appropriateness and refine AI-driven synthesis for immersive environments. Supplementary video:this https URL"
2506.23957,"Video stabilization is pivotal for video processing, as it removes unwanted shakiness while preserving the original user motion intent. Existing approaches, depending on the domain they operate, suffer from several issues (e.g. geometric distortions, excessive cropping, poor generalization) that degrade the user experience. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{GaVS}, a novel 3D-grounded approach that reformulates video stabilization as a temporally-consistent `local reconstruction and rendering' paradigm. Given 3D camera poses, we augment a reconstruction model to predict Gaussian Splatting primitives, and finetune it at test-time, with multi-view dynamics-aware photometric supervision and cross-frame regularization, to produce temporally-consistent local reconstructions. The model are then used to render each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid frame cropping. Our method is evaluated on a repurposed dataset, instilled with 3D-grounded information, covering samples with diverse camera motions and scene dynamics. Quantitatively, our method is competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art 2D and 2.5D approaches in terms of conventional task metrics and new geometry consistency. Qualitatively, our method produces noticeably better results compared to alternatives, validated by the user study."
2506.24108,"Denoising diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images conditioned on text prompts, yet their effectiveness heavily relies on careful guidance during the sampling process. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale, which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation. Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance, offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality."
2507.00006,"We propose MVGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-view image generation models (MVGs) that evaluates 3D consistency in geometry and texture, image quality, and semantics (using vision language models). Recently, MVGs have been the main driving force in 3D object creation. However, existing metrics compare generated images against ground truth target views, which is not suitable for generative tasks where multiple solutions exist while differing from ground truth. Furthermore, different MVGs are trained on different view angles, synthetic data and specific lightings -- robustness to these factors and generalization to real data are rarely evaluated thoroughly. Without a rigorous evaluation protocol, it is also unclear what design choices contribute to the progress of MVGs. MVGBench evaluates three different aspects: best setup performance, generalization to real data and robustness. Instead of comparing against ground truth, we introduce a novel 3D self-consistency metric which compares 3D reconstructions from disjoint generated multi-views. We systematically compare 12 existing MVGs on 4 different curated real and synthetic datasets. With our analysis, we identify important limitations of existing methods specially in terms of robustness and generalization, and we find the most critical design choices. Using the discovered best practices, we propose ViFiGen, a method that outperforms all evaluated MVGs on 3D consistency. Our code, model, and benchmark suite will be publicly released."
2507.00412,"Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that learn Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) from point cloud data represent the state-of-the-art for geometrically accurate 3D scene reconstruction. However, training these Neural SDFs often requires enforcing the Eikonal equation, an ill-posed equation that also leads to unstable gradient flows. Numerical Eikonal solvers have relied on viscosity approaches for regularization and stability. Motivated by this well-established theory, we introduce ViscoReg, a novel regularizer that provably stabilizes Neural SDF training. Empirically, ViscoReg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches such as SIREN, DiGS, and StEik on ShapeNet, the Surface Reconstruction Benchmark, and 3D scene reconstruction datasets. Additionally, we establish novel generalization error estimates for Neural SDFs in terms of the training error, using the theory of viscosity solutions."
2507.00476,"Accurate material modeling is crucial for achieving photorealistic rendering, bridging the gap between computer-generated imagery and real-world photographs. While traditional approaches rely on tabulated BRDF data, recent work has shifted towards implicit neural representations, which offer compact and flexible frameworks for a range of tasks. However, their behavior in the frequency domain remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce FreNBRDF, a frequency-rectified neural material representation. By leveraging spherical harmonics, we integrate frequency-domain considerations into neural BRDF modeling. We propose a novel frequency-rectified loss, derived from a frequency analysis of neural materials, and incorporate it into a generalizable and adaptive reconstruction and editing pipeline. This framework enhances fidelity, adaptability, and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreNBRDF  improves the accuracy and robustness of material appearance reconstruction and editing compared to state-of-the-art baselines, enabling more structured and interpretable downstream tasks and applications."
2507.00725,Morse-Cerf theory considers a one-parameter family of smooth functions defined on a manifold and studies the evolution of their critical points with the parameter. This paper presents an adaptation of Morse-Cerf theory to a family of piecewise-linear (PL) functions. The vertex diagram and Cerf diagram are introduced as representations of the evolution of critical points of the PL function. The characterization of a crossing in the vertex diagram based on the homology of the lower links of vertices leads to the definition of a topological descriptor for time-varying scalar fields. An algorithm for computing the Cerf diagram and a measure for comparing two Cerf diagrams are also described together with experimental results on time-varying scalar fields.
2507.0111,"Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a high-performance technique for novel view synthesis, enabling real-time rendering and high-quality reconstruction of small scenes. However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on partitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at chunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly suited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with street-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU memory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce A LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale Gaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our method stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a Level-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the relevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with Sequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a lightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to support real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable seamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex scenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details."
2507.01116,"We present semisimp, a tool for semiautomatic simplification of three dimensional polygonal models. Existing automatic simplification technology is quite mature, but is not sensitive to the heightened importance of distinct semantic model regions such as faces and limbs, nor to simplification constraints imposed by model usage such as animation. semisimp allows users to preserve such regions by intervening in the simplification process. Users can manipulate the order in which basic simplifications are applied to redistribute model detail, improve the simplified models themselves by repositioning vertices with propagation to neighboring levels of detail, and adjust the hierarchical partitioning of the model surface to segment simplification and improve control of reordering and position propagation."
2507.0114,"Immersive visualization of network data enables users to physically navigate and interact with complex structures, but managing transitions between detailed local (egocentric) views and global (exocentric) overviews remains a major challenge. We present a multifocus probe technique for immersive environments that allows users to instantiate multiple egocentric subgraph views while maintaining persistent links to the global network context. Each probe acts as a portable local focus, enabling fine-grained inspection and editing of distant or occluded regions. Visual and haptic guidance mechanisms ensure context preservation during multi-scale interaction. We demonstrate and discuss the usability of our technique for the editing of network data."
2507.02257,"The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting has created the need to integrate traditional computer graphics techniques and assets in splatted environments. Since 3D Gaussian primitives encode lighting and geometry jointly as appearance, meshes are relit improperly when inserted directly in a mixture of 3D Gaussians and thus appear noticeably out of place. We introduce GBake, a specialized tool for baking reflection probes from Gaussian-splatted scenes that enables realistic reflection mapping of traditional 3D meshes in the Unity game engine."
2507.02674,"Image-based lighting is a widely used technique to reproduce shading under real-world lighting conditions, especially in real-time rendering applications. A particularly challenging scenario involves materials exhibiting a sparkling or glittering appearance, caused by discrete microfacets scattered across their surface. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation for image-based lighting of glints, enabling fully dynamic material properties and environment maps. Our novel approach is grounded in real-time glint rendering under area light illumination and employs standard environment map filtering techniques. Crucially, our environment map filtering process is sufficiently fast to be executed on a per-frame basis. Our method assumes that the environment map is partitioned into few homogeneous regions of constant radiance. By filtering the corresponding indicator functions with the normal distribution function, we obtain the probabilities for individual microfacets to reflect light from each region. During shading, these probabilities are utilized to hierarchically sample a multinomial distribution, facilitated by our novel dual-gated Gaussian approximation of binomial distributions. We validate that our real-time approximation is close to ground-truth renderings for a range of material properties and lighting conditions, and demonstrate robust and stable performance, with little overhead over rendering glints from a single directional light. Compared to rendering smooth materials without glints, our approach requires twice as much memory to store the prefiltered environment map."
2507.03256,"Talking head generation with arbitrary identities and speech audio remains a crucial problem in the realm of the virtual metaverse. Recently, diffusion models have become a popular generative technique in this field with their strong generation capabilities. However, several challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference and visual artifacts caused by the implicit latent space of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), which complicates the diffusion process; 2) a lack of authentic facial expressions and head movements due to inadequate multi-modal information fusion. In this paper, MoDA handles these challenges by: 1) defining a joint parameter space that bridges motion generation and neural rendering, and leveraging flow matching to simplify diffusion learning; 2) introducing a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the interaction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, enhancing overall facial expressiveness. In addition, a coarse-to-fine fusion strategy is employed to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring effective feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MoDA improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications. Project Page:this https URL"
2507.03731,"We present 3D PixBrush, a method for performing image-driven edits of local regions on 3D meshes. 3D PixBrush predicts a localization mask and a synthesized texture that faithfully portray the object in the reference image. Our predicted localizations are both globally coherent and locally precise. Globally - our method contextualizes the object in the reference image and automatically positions it onto the input mesh. Locally - our method produces masks that conform to the geometry of the reference image. Notably, our method does not require any user input (in the form of scribbles or bounding boxes) to achieve accurate localizations. Instead, our method predicts a localization mask on the 3D mesh from scratch. To achieve this, we propose a modification to the score distillation sampling technique which incorporates both the predicted localization and the reference image, referred to as localization-modulated image guidance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique on a wide variety of meshes and images."
2507.03836,"Interactive time-varying volume visualization is challenging due to its complex spatiotemporal features and sheer size of the dataset. Recent works transform the original discrete time-varying volumetric data into continuous Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to address the issues of compression, rendering, and super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains. However, training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash, a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution for feature tracking and evolution visualization. Experiments show the F-Hash achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed in training various time-varying volumetric datasets for diverse features. We also proposed an adaptive ray marching algorithm to optimize the sample streaming for faster rendering of the time-varying neural representation."
2507.04084,"Self-supervised learning has emerged as a prominent research direction in point cloud processing. While existing models predominantly concentrate on reconstruction tasks at higher encoder layers, they often neglect the effective utilization of low-level local features, which are typically employed solely for activation computations rather than directly contributing to reconstruction tasks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PointAMaLR, a novel self-supervised learning framework that enhances feature representation and processing accuracy through attention-guided multi-scale local reconstruction. PointAMaLR implements hierarchical reconstruction across multiple local regions, with lower layers focusing on fine-scale feature restoration while upper layers address coarse-scale feature reconstruction, thereby enabling complex inter-patch interactions. Furthermore, to augment feature representation capabilities, we incorporate a Local Attention (LA) module in the embedding layer to enhance semantic feature understanding. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets ModelNet and ShapeNet demonstrate PointAMaLR's superior accuracy and quality in both classification and reconstruction tasks. Moreover, when evaluated on the real-world dataset ScanObjectNN and the 3D large scene segmentation dataset S3DIS, our model achieves highly competitive performance metrics. These results not only validate PointAMaLR's effectiveness in multi-scale semantic understanding but also underscore its practical applicability in real-world scenarios."
2507.04147,"Virtual reality (VR) significantly transforms immersive digital interfaces, greatly enhancing education, professional practices, and entertainment by increasing user engagement and opening up new possibilities in various industries. Among its numerous applications, image rendering is crucial. Nevertheless, rendering methodologies like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose high computational demands, driven predominantly by user expectations for superior visual quality. This results in notable processing delays for real-time image rendering, which greatly affects the user experience. Additionally, VR devices such as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are intricately linked to human visual behavior, leveraging knowledge from perception and cognition to improve user experience. These insights have spurred the development of foveated rendering, a technique that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution based on the user's gaze direction. The resultant solution, known as gaze-tracked foveated rendering, significantly reduces the computational burden of the rendering process.Although gaze-tracked foveated rendering can reduce rendering costs, the computational overhead of the gaze tracking process itself can sometimes outweigh the rendering savings, leading to increased processing latency. To address this issue, we propose an efficient rendering framework called~\textit{A3FR}, designed to minimize the latency of gaze-tracked foveated rendering via the parallelization of gaze tracking and foveated rendering processes. For the rendering algorithm, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting, a state-of-the-art neural rendering technique. Evaluation results demonstrate that A3FR can reduce end-to-end rendering latency by up to $2\times$ while maintaining visual quality."
2507.05191,"Real-time hair simulation is a vital component in creating believable virtual avatars, as it provides a sense of immersion and authenticity. The dynamic behavior of hair, such as bouncing or swaying in response to character movements like jumping or walking, plays a significant role in enhancing the overall realism and engagement of virtual experiences. Current methods for simulating hair have been constrained by two primary approaches: highly optimized physics-based systems and neural methods. However, state-of-the-art neural techniques have been limited to quasi-static solutions, failing to capture the dynamic behavior of hair. This paper introduces a novel neural method that breaks through these limitations, achieving efficient and stable dynamic hair simulation while outperforming existing approaches. We propose a fully self-supervised method which can be trained without any manual intervention or artist generated training data allowing the method to be integrated with hair reconstruction methods to enable automatic end-to-end methods for avatar reconstruction. Our approach harnesses the power of compact, memory-efficient neural networks to simulate hair at the strand level, allowing for the simulation of diverse hairstyles without excessive computational resources or memory requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method through a variety of hairstyle examples, showcasing its potential for real-world applications."
2507.05304,"3D meshes are fundamental data representations for capturing complex geometric shapes in computer vision and graphics applications. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like images, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the non-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a solution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing methods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their ability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we introduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework that uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and local features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that convert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point clouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the reconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our architecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate global and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset containing human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of reconstruction accuracy."

While convenient, this rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures, followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices. Tested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers photorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating the potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement."
2507.06484,"Despite large-scale pretraining endowing models with language and vision reasoning capabilities, improving their spatial reasoning capability remains challenging due to the lack of data grounded in the 3D world. While it is possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through 3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials, lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results achieved with real data orders of magnitude larger."
2507.06646,"We evaluate the performance of four common learned models utilizing INR and VAE structures for compressing phase-only holograms in holographic displays. The evaluated models include a vanilla MLP, SIREN, and FilmSIREN, with TAESD as the representative VAE model. Our experiments reveal that a pretrained image VAE, TAESD, with 2.2M parameters struggles with phase-only hologram compression, revealing the need for task-specific adaptations. Among the INRs, SIREN with 4.9k parameters achieves %40 compression with high quality in the reconstructed 3D images (PSNR = 34.54 dB). These results emphasize the effectiveness of INRs and identify the limitations of pretrained image compression VAEs for hologram compression task."
2507.0679,"Esports athletes often reduce visual quality to improve latency and frame rate, and increase their in-game performance. Little research has examined the effects of this visuo-spatial tradeoff on performance, but we could find no work studying how players manage this tradeoff in practice. This paper is an initial examination of this question in the game Dota 2. First, we gather the game configuration data of Dota 2 players in a small survey. We learn that players do limit visual detail, particularly by turning off VSYNC, which removes rendering/display synchronization delay but permits visual ""tearing"". Second, we survey the intent of those same players with a few subjective questions. Player intent matches configuration practice. While our sampling of Dota 2 players may not be representative, our survey does reveal suggestive trends that lay the groundwork for future, more rigorous and larger surveys. Such surveys can help new players adapt to the game more quickly, encourage researchers to investigate the relative importance of temporal and visual detail, and justify design effort by developers in ""low visual"" game configurations."
2507.07,"We propose a novel framework that enhances non-rigid 3D model deformations by bridging mesh representations with 3D Gaussian splatting. While traditional Gaussian splatting delivers fast, real-time radiance-field rendering, its post-editing capabilities and support for large-scale, non-rigid deformations remain limited. Our method addresses these challenges by embedding Gaussian kernels directly onto explicit mesh surfaces. This allows the mesh's inherent topological and geometric priors to guide intuitive editing operations -- such as moving, scaling, and rotating individual 3D components -- and enables complex deformations like bending and stretching. This work paves the way for more flexible 3D content-creation workflows in applications spanning virtual reality, character animation, and interactive design."
2507.07133,"We introduce the task of generative panoramic image stitching, which aims to synthesize seamless panoramas that are faithful to the content of multiple reference images containing parallax effects and strong variations in lighting, camera capture settings, or style. In this challenging setting, traditional image stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other artifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content consistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with synthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these limitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting model to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference images. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single reference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that faithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach significantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and the consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured datasets."
2507.07387,"We introduce Digital Salon, a comprehensive hair authoring system that supports real-time 3D hair generation, simulation, and rendering. Unlike existing methods that focus on isolated parts of 3D hair modeling and involve a heavy computation process or network training, Digital Salon offers a holistic and interactive system that lowers the technical barriers of 3D hair modeling through natural language-based interaction. The system guides users through four key stages: text-guided hair retrieval, real-time hair simulation, interactive hair refinement, and hair-conditioned image generation. This cohesive workflow makes advanced hair design accessible to users of varying skill levels and dramatically streamlines the creative process in digital media with an intuitive, versatile, and efficient solution for hair modeling. User studies show that our system can outperform traditional hair modeling workflows for rapid prototyping.

2507.0744,"Modeling the dynamic behavior of deformable objects is crucial for creating realistic digital worlds. While conventional simulations produce high-quality motions, their computational costs are often prohibitive. Subspace simulation techniques address this challenge by restricting deformations to a lower-dimensional space, improving performance while maintaining visually compelling results. However, even subspace methods struggle to meet the stringent performance demands of portable devices such as virtual reality headsets and mobile platforms. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel subspace simulation framework powered by a neural latent-space integrator. Our approach leverages self-supervised learning to enhance inference stability and generalization. By operating entirely within latent space, our method eliminates the need for full-space computations, resulting in a highly efficient method well-suited for deployment on portable devices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging examples involving rods, shells, and solids, showcasing its versatility and potential for widespread adoption."
2507.07465,"Current 4D Gaussian frameworks for dynamic scene reconstruction deliver impressive visual fidelity and rendering speed, however, the inherent trade-off between storage costs and the ability to characterize complex physical motions significantly limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle these problems, we propose SD-GS, a compact and efficient dynamic Gaussian splatting framework for complex dynamic scene reconstruction, featuring two key contributions. First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and memory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple 3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric backbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex motions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively grows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing redundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer anchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\% reduction in model size and an average of 100\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality."
2507.07623,"Capture stages are high-end sources of state-of-the-art recordings for downstream applications in movies, games, and other media. One crucial step in almost all pipelines is the matting of images to isolate the captured performances from the background. While common matting algorithms deliver remarkable performance in other applications like teleconferencing and mobile entertainment, we found that they struggle significantly with the peculiarities of capture stage content. The goal of our work is to share insights into those challenges as a curated list of those characteristics along with a constructive discussion for proactive intervention and present a guideline to practitioners for an improved workflow to mitigate unresolved challenges. To this end, we also demonstrate an efficient pipeline to adapt state-of-the-art approaches to such custom setups without the need of extensive annotations, both offline and real-time. For an objective evaluation, we propose a validation methodology based on a leading diffusion model that highlights the benefits of our approach."
2507.07733,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in novel view synthesis. However, rendering reflective objects remains a significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details. We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process."
2507.0789,"In this paper, we present Hi-D maps, a novel method for the visualization of multi-dimensional categorical data. Our work addresses the scarcity of techniques for visualizing a large number of data-dimensions in an effective and space-efficient manner. We have mapped the full data-space onto a 2D regular polygonal region. The polygon is cut hierarchically with lines parallel to a user-controlled, ordered sequence of sides, each representing a dimension. We have used multiple visual cues such as orientation, thickness, color, countable glyphs, and text to depict cross-dimensional information. We have added interactivity and hierarchical browsing to facilitate flexible exploration of the display: small areas can be scrutinized for details. Thus, our method is also easily extendable to visualize hierarchical information. Our glyph animations add an engaging aesthetic during interaction. Like many visualizations, Hi-D maps become less effective when a large number of dimensions stresses perceptual limits, but Hi-D maps may add clarity before those limits are reached."
2507.08285,"Drag-based editing allows precise object manipulation through point-based control, offering user convenience. However, current methods often suffer from a geometric inconsistency problem by focusing exclusively on matching user-defined points, neglecting the broader geometry and leading to artifacts or unstable edits. We propose FlowDrag, which leverages geometric information for more accurate and coherent transformations. Our approach constructs a 3D mesh from the image, using an energy function to guide mesh deformation based on user-defined drag points. The resulting mesh displacements are projected into 2D and incorporated into a UNet denoising process, enabling precise handle-to-target point alignment while preserving structural integrity. Additionally, existing drag-editing benchmarks provide no ground truth, making it difficult to assess how accurately the edits match the intended transformations. To address this, we present VFD (VidFrameDrag) benchmark dataset, which provides ground-truth frames using consecutive shots in a video dataset. FlowDrag outperforms existing drag-based editing methods on both VFD Bench and DragBench."
2507.08513,"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with accurately capturing camera-object relations, especially for object orientation, camera viewpoint, and camera shots. This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications."
2507.0914,"Creating high-quality anime illustrations presents notable challenges, particularly for beginners, due to the intricate styles and fine details inherent in anime art. We present an interactive drawing guidance system specifically designed for anime illustrations to address this issue. It offers real-time guidance to help users refine their work and streamline the creative process. Our system is built upon the StreamDiffusion pipeline to deliver real-time drawing assistance. We fine-tune Stable Diffusion with LoRA to synthesize anime style RGB images from user-provided hand-drawn sketches and prompts. Leveraging the Informative Drawings model, we transform these RGB images into rough sketches, which are further refined into structured guidance sketches using a custom-designed optimizer. The proposed system offers precise, real-time guidance aligned with the creative intent of the user, significantly enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy of the drawing process. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a user study, gathering empirical feedback on both system performance and interface usability."
2507.09146,"Fluid simulation techniques are widely used in various fields such as film production, but controlling complex fluid behaviors remains challenging. While recent generative models enable intuitive generation of vector fields from user sketches, they struggle to maintain physical properties such as incompressibility. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method for interactively designing 2D vector fields. Conventional generative models can intuitively generate vector fields from user sketches, but remain difficult to consider physical properties. Therefore, we add a simple editing process after generating the vector field. In the first stage, we use a latent diffusion model~(LDM) to automatically generate initial 2D vector fields from user sketches. In the second stage, we apply the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition to locally extract physical properties such as incompressibility from the results generated by LDM and recompose them according to user intentions. Through multiple experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."
2507.09441,"High-resolution image synthesis with diffusion models often suffers from energy instabilities and guidance artifacts that degrade visual quality. We analyze the latent energy landscape during sampling and propose adaptive classifier-free guidance (CFG) schedules that maintain stable energy trajectories. Our approach introduces energy-aware scheduling strategies that modulate guidance strength over time, achieving superior stability scores (0.9998) and consistency metrics (0.9873) compared to fixed-guidance approaches. We demonstrate that DPM++ 2M with linear-decreasing CFG scheduling yields optimal performance, providing sharper, more faithful images while reducing artifacts. Our energy profiling framework serves as a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding and improving diffusion model behavior."
2507.09704,"We propose a real-time method for reactive motion synthesis based on the known trajectory of input character, predicting instant reactions using only historical, user-controlled motions. Our method handles the uncertainty of future movements by introducing an intention predictor, which forecasts key joint intentions to make pose prediction more deterministic from the historical interaction. The intention is later encoded into the latent space of its reactive motion, matched with a codebook which represents mappings between input and output. It samples a categorical distribution for pose generation and strengthens model robustness through adversarial training. Unlike previous offline approaches, the system can recursively generate intentions and reactive motions using feedback from earlier steps, enabling real-time, long-term realistic interactive synthesis. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments show our approach outperforms other matching-based motion synthesis approaches, delivering superior stability and generalizability. In our method, user can also actively influence the outcome by controlling the moving directions, creating a personalized interaction path that deviates from predefined trajectories."
2507.09792,"Computer-aided design (CAD) is the digital construction of 2D and 3D objects, and is central to a wide range of engineering and manufacturing applications like automobile and aviation. Despite its importance, CAD modeling remains largely a time-intensive, manual task. Recent works have attempted to automate this process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence representations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the potential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this work, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models annotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our pipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs to generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural language descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this approach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail to reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and topological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler characteristic to provide richer structural insights. Our experiments and ablation studies on both synthetic and human-annotated data demonstrate that CADmium is able to automate CAD design, drastically speeding up the design of new objects. The dataset, code, and fine-tuned models are available online."
2507.10542,"Generating high-fidelity real-time animated sequences of photorealistic 3D head avatars is important for many graphics applications, including immersive telepresence and movies. This is a challenging problem particularly when rendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures and expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads, including skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple locally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable creating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In contrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we condition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and synthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a patch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how to translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling the patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene representation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians on-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ color-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality results and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images. By leveraging patch-level expressions, ScaffoldAvatar consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with visually natural motion, while encompassing diverse facial expressions and styles in real time."
2507.10883,"Traditional layered graph depictions such as flow charts are in wide use. Yet as graphs grow more complex, these depictions can become difficult to understand. Quilts are matrix-based depictions for layered graphs designed to address this problem. In this research, we first improve Quilts by developing three design alternatives, and then compare the best of these alternatives to better-known node-link and matrix depictions. A primary weakness in Quilts is their depiction of skip links, links that do not simply connect to a succeeding layer. Therefore in our first study, we compare Quilts using color-only, text-only, and mixed (color and text) skip link depictions, finding that path finding with the color-only depiction is significantly slower and less accurate, and that in certain cases, the mixed depiction offers an advantage over the text-only depiction. In our second study, we compare Quilts using the mixed depiction to node-link diagrams and centered matrices. Overall results show that users can find paths through graphs significantly faster with Quilts (46.6 secs) than with node-link (58.3 secs) or matrix (71.2 secs) diagrams. This speed advantage is still greater in large graphs (e.g. in 200 node graphs, 55.4 secs vs. 71.1 secs for node-link and 84.2 secs for matrix depictions)."
2507.10924,"Offset surfaces, defined as the Minkowski sum of a base surface and a rolling ball, play a crucial role in geometry processing, with applications ranging from coverage motion planning to brush modeling. While considerable progress has been made in computing constant-radius offset surfaces, computing variable-radius offset surfaces remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we present OffsetCrust, a novel framework that efficiently addresses the variable-radius offsetting problem by computing a power diagram. Let $R$ denote the radius function defined on the base surface $S$. The power diagram is constructed from contributing sites, consisting of carefully sampled base points on $S$ and their corresponding off-surface points, displaced along $R$-dependent directions. In the constant-radius case only, these displacement directions align exactly with the surface normals of $S$. Moreover, our method mitigates the misalignment issues commonly seen in crust-based approaches through a lightweight fine-tuning procedure. We validate the accuracy and efficiency of OffsetCrust through extensive experiments, and demonstrate its practical utility in applications such as reconstructing original boundary surfaces from medial axis transform (MAT) representations."
2507.11465,"High-quality 3D assets are essential for various applications in computer graphics and 3D vision but remain scarce due to significant acquisition costs. To address this shortage, we introduce Elevate3D, a novel framework that transforms readily accessible low-quality 3D assets into higher quality. At the core of Elevate3D is HFS-SDEdit, a specialized texture enhancement method that significantly improves texture quality while preserving the appearance and geometry while fixing its degradations. Furthermore, Elevate3D operates in a view-by-view manner, alternating between texture and geometry refinement. Unlike previous methods that have largely overlooked geometry refinement, our framework leverages geometric cues from images refined with HFS-SDEdit by employing state-of-the-art monocular geometry predictors. This approach ensures detailed and accurate geometry that aligns seamlessly with the enhanced texture. Elevate3D outperforms recent competitors by achieving state-of-the-art quality in 3D model refinement, effectively addressing the scarcity of high-quality open-source 3D assets."
2507.11794,"This study explores the capabilities of WebGPU, an emerging web graphics paradigm, for real-time cloth simulation. Traditional WebGL-based methods have been in handling complex physical simulations due to their emphasis on graphics rendering rather than general-purpose GPU (GPGPU) operations. WebGPU, designed to provide modern 3D graphics and computational capabilities, offers significant improvements through parallel processing and support for computational shaders. In this work, we implemented a cloth simulation system using the Mass-Spring Method within the WebGPU framework, integrating collision detection and response handling with the 3D surface model. First, comparative performance evaluations demonstrate that WebGPU substantially outperforms WebGL, particularly in high-resolution simulations, maintaining 60 frames per second (fps) even with up to 640K nodes. The second experiment aimed to determine the real-time limitations of WebGPU and confirmed that WebGPU can handle real-time collisions between 4K and 100k cloth node models and a 100K triangle surface model in real-time. These experiments also highlight the importance of balancing real-time performance with realistic rendering when handling collisions between cloth models and complex 3D objects.

2507.11857,"This paper is a study of techniques for measuring and predicting visual fidelity. As visual stimuli we use polygonal models, and vary their fidelity with two different model simplification algorithms. We also group the stimuli into two object types: animals and man made artifacts. We examine three different experimental techniques for measuring these fidelity changes: naming times, ratings, and preferences. All the measures were sensitive to the type of simplification and level of simplification. However, the measures differed from one another in their response to object type. We also examine several automatic techniques for predicting these experimental measures, including techniques based on images and on the models themselves. Automatic measures of fidelity were successful at predicting experimental ratings, less successful at predicting preferences, and largely failures at predicting naming times. We conclude with suggestions for use and improvement of the experimental and automatic measures of visual fidelity."
2507.11949,"Enabling virtual humans to dynamically and realistically respond to diverse auditory stimuli remains a key challenge in character animation, demanding the integration of perceptual modeling and motion synthesis. Despite its significance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have primarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to generate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of spatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge this gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to spatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human Motion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and motion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by SPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once trained, MOSPA can generate diverse, realistic human motions conditioned on varying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough investigation of the proposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benchmarking, where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. Our code and model are publicly available atthis https URL"
2507.11971,"Current 3D representations like meshes, voxels, point clouds, and NeRF-based neural implicit fields exhibit significant limitations: they are often task-specific, lacking universal applicability across reconstruction, generation, editing, and driving. While meshes offer high precision, their dense vertex data complicates editing; NeRFs deliver excellent rendering but suffer from structural ambiguity, hindering animation and manipulation; all representations inherently struggle with the trade-off between data complexity and fidelity. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel 3D Hierarchical Proxy Node representation. Its core innovation lies in representing an object's shape and texture via a sparse set of hierarchically organized (tree-structured) proxy nodes distributed on its surface and interior. Each node stores local shape and texture information (implicitly encoded by a small MLP) within its neighborhood. Querying any 3D coordinate's properties involves efficient neural interpolation and lightweight decoding from relevant nearby and parent nodes. This framework yields a highly compact representation where nodes align with local semantics, enabling direct drag-and-edit manipulation, and offers scalable quality-complexity control. Extensive experiments across 3D reconstruction and editing demonstrate our method's expressive efficiency, high-fidelity rendering quality, and superior editability."
2507.12156,"Reconstructing dynamic fluids from sparse views is a long-standing and challenging problem, due to the severe lack of 3D information from insufficient view coverage. While several pioneering approaches have attempted to address this issue using differentiable rendering or novel view synthesis, they are often limited by time-consuming optimization and refinement processes under ill-posed conditions. To tackle above challenges, we propose SmokeSVD, an efficient and effective framework to progressively generate and reconstruct dynamic smoke from a single video by integrating both the powerful generative capabilities from diffusion models and physically guided consistency optimization towards realistic appearance and dynamic evolution. Specifically, we first propose a physically guided side-view synthesizer based on diffusion models, which explicitly incorporates divergence and gradient guidance of velocity fields to generate visually realistic and spatio-temporally consistent side-view images frame by frame, significantly alleviating the ill-posedness of single-view reconstruction without imposing additional constraints. Subsequently, we determine a rough estimation of density field from the pair of front-view input and side-view synthetic image, and further refine 2D blurry novel-view images and 3D coarse-grained density field through an iterative process that progressively renders and enhances the images from increasing novel viewing angles, generating high-quality multi-view image sequences. Finally, we reconstruct and estimate the fine-grained density field, velocity field, and smoke source via differentiable advection by leveraging the Navier-Stokes equations. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our approach achieves high-quality reconstruction and outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques."
2507.12168,"It is demanding to author an existing hairstyle for novel characters in games and VR applications. However, it is a non-trivial task for artists due to the complicated hair geometries and spatial interactions to preserve. In this paper, we present an automatic shape adaptation method to retarget 3D hairstyles. We formulate the adaptation process as a constrained optimization problem, where all the shape properties and spatial relationships are converted into individual objectives and constraints. To make such an optimization on high-resolution hairstyles tractable, we adopt a multi-scale strategy to compute the target positions of the hair strands in a coarse-to-fine manner. The global solving for the inter-strands coupling is restricted to the coarse level, and the solving for fine details is made local and parallel. In addition, we present a novel hairline edit tool to allow for user customization during retargeting. We achieve it by solving physics-based deformations of an embedded membrane to redistribute the hair roots with minimal distortion. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through quantitative and qualitative experiments on various hairstyles and characters."

To address this issue, we propose WaFusion, a novel framework combining wavelet decomposition and diffusion models to generate high-quality, realistic morphed face images efficiently. WaFusion leverages the structural details captured by wavelet transforms and the generative capabilities of diffusion models, producing face morphs with minimal artifacts. Experiments conducted on FERET, FRGC, FRLL, and WVU Twin datasets demonstrate WaFusion's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, producing high-resolution morphs with fewer artifacts. Our framework excels across key biometric metrics, including the Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate (APCER), Bona Fide Presentation Classification Error Rate (BPCER), and Equal Error Rate (EER). This work sets a new benchmark in biometric morph generation, offering a cutting-edge and efficient solution to enhance biometric security systems."
2507.12498,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction, which effectively balances rendering quality, efficiency, and speed. However, existing 3DGS approaches usually generate plausible outputs and face significant challenges in complex scene reconstruction, manifesting as incomplete holistic structural outlines and unclear local lighting effects. To address these issues simultaneously, we propose a novel decoupled optimization framework, which integrates wavelet decomposition into 3D Gaussian Splatting and 2D sampling. Technically, through 3D wavelet decomposition, our approach divides point clouds into high-frequency and low-frequency components, enabling targeted optimization for each. The low-frequency component captures global structural outlines and manages the distribution of Gaussians through voxelization. In contrast, the high-frequency component restores intricate geometric and textural details while incorporating a relight module to mitigate lighting artifacts and enhance photorealistic rendering. Additionally, a 2D wavelet decomposition is applied to the training images, simulating radiance variations. This provides critical guidance for high-frequency detail reconstruction, ensuring seamless integration of details with the global structure. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, surpassing existing approaches and advancing the field of 3D scene reconstruction."
2507.126,"Simulating hair dynamics that generalize across arbitrary hairstyles, body shapes, and motions is a critical challenge. Our novel two-stage neural solution is the first to leverage Transformer-based architectures for such a broad generalization. We propose a Transformer-powered static network that predicts static draped shapes for any hairstyle, effectively resolving hair-body penetrations and preserving hair fidelity. Subsequently, a dynamic network with a novel cross-attention mechanism fuses static hair features with kinematic input to generate expressive dynamics and complex secondary motions. This dynamic network also allows for efficient fine-tuning of challenging motion sequences, such as abrupt head movements. Our method offers real-time inference for both static single-frame drapes and dynamic drapes over pose sequences. Our method demonstrates high-fidelity and generalizable dynamic hair across various styles, guided by physics-informed losses, and can resolve penetrations even for complex, unseen long hairstyles, highlighting its broad generalization."
2507.12667,"Visualization of large-scale time-dependent simulation data is crucial for domain scientists to analyze complex phenomena, but it demands significant I/O bandwidth, storage, and computational resources. To enable effective visualization on local, low-end machines, recent advances in view synthesis techniques, such as neural radiance fields, utilize neural networks to generate novel visualizations for volumetric scenes. However, these methods focus on reconstruction quality rather than facilitating interactive visualization exploration, such as feature extraction and tracking. We introduce VolSegGS, a novel Gaussian splatting framework that supports interactive segmentation and tracking in dynamic volumetric scenes for exploratory visualization and analysis. Our approach utilizes deformable 3D Gaussians to represent a dynamic volumetric scene, allowing for real-time novel view synthesis. For accurate segmentation, we leverage the view-independent colors of Gaussians for coarse-level segmentation and refine the results with an affinity field network for fine-level segmentation. Additionally, by embedding segmentation results within the Gaussians, we ensure that their deformation enables continuous tracking of segmented regions over time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VolSegGS with several time-varying datasets and compare our solutions against state-of-the-art methods. With the ability to interact with a dynamic scene in real time and provide flexible segmentation and tracking capabilities, VolSegGS offers a powerful solution under low computational demands. This framework unlocks exciting new possibilities for time-varying volumetric data analysis and visualization."

2507.13388,"With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, Stable Diffusion (SD) has emerged as a state-of-the-art framework for high-fidelity im-age synthesis. However, existing SD models suffer from suboptimal feature aggregation, leading to in-complete semantic alignment and loss of fine-grained details, especially in highly textured and complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-latent integration framework that en-hances feature interactions between the base latent and refined latent representations. Our approach em-ploys a feature concatenation strategy followed by an adaptive fusion module, which can be instantiated as either (i) an Adaptive Global Fusion (AGF) for hier-archical feature harmonization, or (ii) a Dynamic Spatial Fusion (DSF) for spatially-aware refinement. This design enables more effective cross-latent com-munication, preserving both global coherence and local texture fidelity. Our GitHub page:this https URL."
2507.13419,"The research topic of digital twins has attracted a large amount of interest over the past decade. However, publicly available exemplars remain scarce. In the interest of open and reproducible science, in this exemplar paper we present a lab-scale gantry crane and its digital twin. The exemplar comprises both the physical and digital side of the twin system. The physical side consists of the physical crane and its controller. The digital side covers the CAD models and kinematic model of the crane, and provides services for optimal control, historical data logging, data visualization and continuous validation. We used this setup as use case in several previous publications where its functionality was validated. It is publicly available and only relies on other freely available and commonly used software, this way we hope it can be used for future research or education on the topic of digital twins."
2507.13586,"Advancements in volume visualization (VolVis) focus on extracting insights from 3D volumetric data by generating visually compelling renderings that reveal complex internal structures. Existing VolVis approaches have explored non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness, and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives, extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes, resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and editing flexibility."
2507.13917,"This paper presents Neural-GASh, a novel real-time shading pipeline for 3D meshes, that leverages a neural radiance field architecture to perform image-based rendering (IBR) using Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA)-encoded vertex information as input. Unlike traditional Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) methods, that require expensive offline precomputations, our learned model directly consumes CGA-based representations of vertex positions and normals, enabling dynamic scene shading without precomputation. Integrated seamlessly into the Unity engine, Neural-GASh facilitates accurate shading of animated and deformed 3D meshes - capabilities essential for dynamic, interactive environments. The shading of the scene is implemented within Unity, where rotation of scene lights in terms of Spherical Harmonics is also performed optimally using CGA. This neural field approach is designed to deliver fast and efficient light transport simulation across diverse platforms, including mobile and VR, while preserving high rendering quality. Additionally, we evaluate our method on scenes generated via 3D Gaussian splats, further demonstrating the flexibility and robustness of Neural-GASh in diverse scenarios. Performance is evaluated in comparison to conventional PRT, demonstrating competitive rendering speeds even with complex geometries."
2507.14624,"Reconstructing photo-realistic large-scale scenes from images, for example at city scale, is a long-standing problem in computer graphics. Neural rendering is an emerging technique that enables photo-realistic image synthesis from previously unobserved viewpoints; however, state-of-the-art neural rendering methods have difficulty efficiently rendering a high complex large-scale scene because these methods typically trade scene size, fidelity, and rendering speed for quality. The other stream of techniques utilizes scene geometries for reconstruction. But the cost of building and maintaining a large set of geometry data increases as scene size grows. Our work explores novel view synthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit use of scene geometries. Specifically, given sparse images of the scene (captured from the real world), we reconstruct intermediate, multi-scale, implicit representations of scene geometries. In this way, our method avoids explicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational cost of maintaining large 3D data. Unlike current methods, we reconstruct the scene using a probe data structure. Probe data hold highly accurate depth information of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex scenes. By reconstructing the scene using probe data, the rendering cost is independent of the complexity of the scene. As such, our approach combines geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, when rendering large-scale scenes, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than using explicit scene geometry. Therefore, our neural representation approach can potentially be applied to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications."
2507.14841,"In recent years, 3D generation has made great strides in both academia and industry. However, generating 3D scenes from a single RGB image remains a significant challenge, as current approaches often struggle to ensure both object generation quality and scene coherence in multi-object scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage framework for 3D scene generation with explicit geometric representations and high-quality textural details via single image-guided model generation and spatial layout optimization. Our method begins with an image instance segmentation and inpainting phase, which recovers missing details of occluded objects in the input images, thereby achieving complete generation of foreground 3D assets. Subsequently, our approach captures the spatial geometry of reference image by constructing pseudo-stereo viewpoint for camera parameter estimation and scene depth inference, while employing a model selection strategy to ensure optimal alignment between the 3D assets generated in the previous step and the input. Finally, through model parameterization and minimization of the Chamfer distance between point clouds in 3D and 2D space, our approach optimizes layout parameters to produce an explicit 3D scene representation that maintains precise alignment with input guidance image. Extensive experiments on multi-object scene image sets have demonstrated that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric accuracy and texture fidelity of individual generated 3D models, but also has significant advantages in scene layout synthesis."
2507.1492,"Time series data are prevalent across various domains and often encompass large datasets containing multiple time-dependent features in each sample. Exploring time-varying data is critical for data science practitioners aiming to understand dynamic behaviors and discover periodic patterns and trends. However, the analysis of such data often requires sophisticated procedures and tools. Information visualization is a communication channel that leverages human perceptual abilities to transform abstract data into visual representations. Visualization techniques have been successfully applied in the context of time series to enhance interpretability by graphically representing the temporal evolution of data. The challenge for information visualization developers lies in integrating a wide range of analytical tools into rich visualization systems that can summarize complex datasets while clearly describing the impacts of the temporal component. Such systems enable data scientists to turn raw data into understandable and potentially useful knowledge. This review examines techniques and approaches designed for handling time series data, guiding users through knowledge discovery processes based on visual analysis. We also provide readers with theoretical insights and design guidelines for considering when developing comprehensive information visualization approaches for time series, with a particular focus on time series with multiple features. As a result, we highlight the challenges and future research directions to address open questions in the visualization of time-dependent data."
2507.15186,"As modeling and visualization applications proliferate, there arises a need to simplify large polygonal models at interactive rates. Unfortunately existing polygon mesh simplification algorithms are not well suited for this task because they are either too slow (requiring the simplified model to be pre-computed) or produce models that are too poor in quality. These shortcomings become particularly acute when models are extremely large. We present an algorithm suitable for simplification of large models at interactive speeds. The algorithm is fast and can guarantee displayable results within a given time limit. Results also have good quality. Inspired by splitting algorithms from vector quantization literature, we simplify models in reverse, beginning with an extremely coarse approximation and refining it. Approximations of surface curvature guide the simplification process. Previously produced simplifications can be further refined by using them as input to the algorithm."
2507.15399,"Natural language offers a highly intuitive interface for enabling localized fine-grained edits of 3D shapes. However, prior works face challenges in preserving global coherence while locally modifying the input 3D shape. In this work, we introduce an inpainting-based framework for editing shapes represented as point clouds. Our approach leverages foundation 3D diffusion models for achieving localized shape edits, adding structural guidance in the form of a partial conditional shape, ensuring that other regions correctly preserve the shape's identity. Furthermore, to encourage identity preservation also within the local edited region, we propose an inference-time coordinate blending algorithm which balances reconstruction of the full shape with inpainting at a progression of noise levels during the inference process. Our coordinate blending algorithm seamlessly blends the original shape with its edited version, enabling a fine-grained editing of 3D shapes, all while circumventing the need for computationally expensive and often inaccurate inversion. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms alternative techniques across a wide range of metrics that evaluate both fidelity to the original shape and also adherence to the textual description."
2507.15454,"3D Gaussian Splatting is renowned for its high-fidelity reconstructions and real-time novel view synthesis, yet its lack of semantic understanding limits object-level perception. In this work, we propose ObjectGS, an object-aware framework that unifies 3D scene reconstruction with semantic understanding. Instead of treating the scene as a unified whole, ObjectGS models individual objects as local anchors that generate neural Gaussians and share object IDs, enabling precise object-level reconstruction. During training, we dynamically grow or prune these anchors and optimize their features, while a one-hot ID encoding with a classification loss enforces clear semantic constraints. We show through extensive experiments that ObjectGS not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary and panoptic segmentation tasks, but also integrates seamlessly with applications like mesh extraction and scene editing.

2507.15629,"3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown its detailed expressive ability and highly efficient rendering speed in the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. The application to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the discrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry constraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra continuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian primitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing memory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a discretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by encoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us to link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity transformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the computational cost of raythis http URLkey challenge is to regularize the discrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete representation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\eg Eikonal loss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and enforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based consistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher relighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding complex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method outperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is available atthis https URL."
2507.15979,"We introduce Dream, Lift, Animate (DLA), a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D human avatars from a single image. This is achieved by leveraging multi-view generation, 3D Gaussian lifting, and pose-aware UV-space mapping of 3D Gaussians. Given an image, we first dream plausible multi-views using a video diffusion model, capturing rich geometric and appearance details. These views are then lifted into unstructured 3D Gaussians. To enable animation, we propose a transformer-based encoder that models global spatial relationships and projects these Gaussians into a structured latent representation aligned with the UV space of a parametric body model. This latent code is decoded into UV-space Gaussians that can be animated via body-driven deformation and rendered conditioned on pose and viewpoint. By anchoring Gaussians to the UV manifold, our method ensures consistency during animation while preserving fine visual details. DLA enables real-time rendering and intuitive editing without requiring post-processing. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on ActorsHQ and 4D-Dress datasets in both perceptual quality and photometric accuracy. By combining the generative strengths of video diffusion models with a pose-aware UV-space Gaussian mapping, DLA bridges the gap between unstructured 3D representations and high-fidelity, animation-ready avatars."

2507.16869,"With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), video generation has emerged as one of its most dynamic and impactful subfields. In particular, the advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand for controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user intent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video generation, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex, multi-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it challenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current models. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of additional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human pose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable video synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical applicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both theoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by introducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation models. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models, analyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the denoising process to guide generation. Finally, we categorize existing methods based on the types of control signals they leverage, including single-condition generation, multi-condition generation, and universal controllable generation.

2507.17029,"We propose StreamME, a method focuses on fast 3D avatar reconstruction. The StreamME synchronously records and reconstructs a head avatar from live video streams without any pre-cached data, enabling seamless integration of the reconstructed appearance into downstream applications. This exceptionally fast training strategy, which we refer to as on-the-fly training, is central to our approach. Our method is built upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), eliminating the reliance on MLPs in deformable 3DGS and relying solely on geometry, which significantly improves the adaptation speed to facial expression. To further ensure high efficiency in on-the-fly training, we introduced a simplification strategy based on primary points, which distributes the point clouds more sparsely across the facial surface, optimizing points number while maintaining rendering quality. Leveraging the on-the-fly training capabilities, our method protects the facial privacy and reduces communication bandwidth in VR system or online conference. Additionally, it can be directly applied to downstream application such as animation, toonify, and relighting. Please refer to our project page for more details:this https URL."
2507.17174,"Despite the widespread use of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), the impact of its stochastic optimization process on the results remains underexplored. We observed that it often produces unstable results where the projections of data points are determined mostly by chance rather than reflecting neighboring structures. To address this limitation, we introduce (r,d)-stability to UMAP: a framework that analyzes the stochastic positioning of data points in the projection space. To assess how stochastic elements, specifically initial projection positions and negative sampling, impact UMAP results, we introduce ""ghosts"", or duplicates of data points representing potential positional variations due to stochasticity. We define a data point's projection as (r,d)-stable if its ghosts perturbed within a circle of radius r in the initial projection remain confined within a circle of radius d for their final positions. To efficiently compute the ghost projections, we develop an adaptive dropping scheme that reduces a runtime up to 60% compared to an unoptimized baseline while maintaining approximately 90% of unstable points. We also present a visualization tool that supports the interactive exploration of the (r,d)-stability of data points. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by examining the stability of projections of real-world datasets and present usage guidelines for the effective use of our framework."
2507.17184,"In the current practices of both industry and academia, the convergence and accuracy of finite element calculations are closely related to the methods and quality of mesh generation. For years, the research on high-quality mesh generation in the domestic academic field has mainly referred to the local quality of quadrilaterals and hexahedrons approximating that of squares and cubes. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a brand-new research direction and content: it is necessary to explore and study the influence of the overall global arrangement structure and pattern of super structured quadrilateral meshes on the convergence and calculation accuracy of finite element calculations. Through the research in this new field, it can help solve the non-rigorous state of serious reliance on ""experience"" in the mesh generation stage during simulation in the current industry and academia, and make clear judgments on which global arrangements of mesh generation can ensure the convergence of finite element calculations. In order to generate and design super-structured quadrilateral meshes with controllable overall arrangement structures, a large number of modern two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometric topology theories are required, such as moduli space, Teichmüller space, harmonic foliations, dynamical systems, surface mappings, meromorphic quadratic differentials, surface mappings, etc."
2507.17265,"We present a novel visualization-driven illumination model for density plots, a new technique to enhance density plots by effectively revealing the detailed structures in high- and medium-density regions and outliers in low-density regions, while avoiding artifacts in the density field's colors. When visualizing large and dense discrete point samples, scatterplots and dot density maps often suffer from overplotting, and density plots are commonly employed to provide aggregated views while revealing underlying structures. Yet, in such density plots, existing illumination models may produce color distortion and hide details in low-density regions, making it challenging to look up density values, compare them, and find outliers. The key novelty in this work includes (i) a visualization-driven illumination model that inherently supports density-plot-specific analysis tasks and (ii) a new image composition technique to reduce the interference between the image shading and the color-encoded density values. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique, we conducted a quantitative study, an empirical evaluation of our technique in a controlled study, and two case studies, exploring twelve datasets with up to two million data point samples."
2507.17336,"Dynamic 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) effectively extends the high-speed rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to represent volumetric videos. However, the large number of Gaussians, substantial temporal redundancies, and especially the absence of an entropy-aware compression framework result in large storage requirements. Consequently, this poses significant challenges for practical deployment, efficient edge-device processing, and data transmission. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end RD-optimized compression framework tailored for 4DGS, aiming to enable flexible, high-fidelity rendering across varied computational platforms. Leveraging Fully Explicit Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (Ex4DGS), one of the state-of-the-art 4DGS methods, as our baseline, we start from the existing 3DGS compression methods for compatibility while effectively addressing additional challenges introduced by the temporal axis. In particular, instead of storing motion trajectories independently per point, we employ a wavelet transform to reflect the real-world smoothness prior, significantly enhancing storage efficiency. This approach yields significantly improved compression ratios and provides a user-controlled balance between compression efficiency and rendering quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving up to 91$\times$ compression compared to the original Ex4DGS model while maintaining high visual fidelity. These results highlight the applicability of our framework for real-time dynamic scene rendering in diverse scenarios, from resource-constrained edge devices to high-performance environments.

2507.1744,"Real-time rendering imposes strict limitations on the sampling budget for light transport simulation, often resulting in noisy images. However, denoisers have demonstrated that it is possible to produce noise-free images through filtering. We enhance image quality by removing noise before material shading, rather than filtering already shaded noisy images. This approach allows for material-agnostic denoising (MAD) and leverages machine learning by approximating the light transport integral operator with a neural network, effectively performing parametric integration with neural operators. Our method operates in real-time, requires data from only a single frame, seamlessly integrates with existing denoisers and temporal anti-aliasing techniques, and is efficient to train. Additionally, it is straightforward to incorporate with physically based rendering algorithms."

We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs, enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without any test-time optimization.

2507.18155,"Despite recent progress in 3D head avatar generation, balancing identity preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e., animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally, we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM faces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive facial motions.

2507.18231,"Integrating inverse rendering with multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) yields more accurate 3D reconstructions than the inverse rendering approaches that rely on fixed environment illumination. However, efficient inverse rendering with MVPS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we introduce the Gaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently and jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that is illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first reconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry. Based on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse rendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing multi-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the rendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals. We also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to refine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and multi-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis, relighting, and material and shape editing. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior works in terms of reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency."
2507.18352,"The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset, recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven digital characters."

2507.18899,"We propose a method to procedurally generate a familiar yet complex human artifact: the city. We are not trying to reproduce existing cities, but to generate artificial cities that are convincing and plausible by capturing developmental behavior. In addition, our results are meant to build upon themselves, such that they ought to look compelling at any point along the transition from village to metropolis. Our approach largely focuses upon land usage and building distribution for creating realistic city environments, whereas previous attempts at city modeling have mainly focused on populating road networks. Finally, we want our model to be self automated to the point that the only necessary input is a terrain description, but other high-level and low-level parameters can be specified to support artistic contributions. With the aid of agent based simulation we are generating a system of agents and behaviors that interact with one another through their effects upon a simulated environment. Our philosophy is that as each agent follows a simple behavioral rule set, a more complex behavior will tend to emerge out of the interactions between the agents and their differing rule sets. By confining our model to a set of simple rules for each class of agents, we hope to make our model extendible not only in regard to the types of structures that are produced, but also in describing the social and cultural influences prevalent in all cities"
2507.18972,"Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities. Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in massive time series data in two usage scenarios."
2507.19718,"Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization, volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering. Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache. This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while maintaining comparable computational efficiency."
2507.1983,"Recent advances in leveraging large-scale Internet photo collections for 3D reconstruction have enabled immersive virtual exploration of landmarks and historic sites worldwide. However, little attention has been given to the immersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which remains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we draw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use unconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for understanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we extend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel framework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo collections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the same viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance field, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language feature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the multi-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next, we propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance language field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively compress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally, to quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark dataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained photo collections. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods, delivering accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and enabling applications such as interactive roaming with open-vocabulary queries, architectural style pattern recognition, and 3D scene editing."
2507.19836,"Modern artistic productions increasingly demand automated choreography generation that adapts to diverse musical styles and individual dancer characteristics. Existing approaches often fail to produce high-quality dance videos that harmonize with both musical rhythm and user-defined choreography styles, limiting their applicability in real-world creative contexts. To address this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that uses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries between music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints imposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports style-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical genres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to handle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel music encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the generated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the input music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match both musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that measure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments confirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple dimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style adherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of creative applications.

However, their high reconstruction quality comes at the cost of requiring a large number of primitives. We identify this issue as stemming from the entanglement of geometry and appearance in Gaussian Splatting. To address this, we introduce a neural shell texture, a global representation that encodes texture information around the surface. We use Gaussian primitives as both a geometric representation and texture field samplers, efficiently splatting texture features into image space. Our evaluation demonstrates that this disentanglement enables high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail reconstruction, and easy textured mesh extraction, all while using significantly fewer primitives."

The first algorithm calculates the center of mass of the discrete model based on the center of mass of each triangular facet in the system, ensuring uniform molten plastic distribution during mold cavity filling. Two sub-algorithms intelligently evaluate the geometry and optimal injection point location. The first sub-algorithm generates a geometric matrix based on a two-dimensional nodal quadrature adapted to the part's bounding box. The second sub-algorithm projects the nodal matrix and associated circular areas orthogonally on the part's surface along the demolding direction. The optimal injection point location is determined by minimizing the distance to the center of mass from the first algorithm's result. This novel methodology has been validated through rheological simulations in six case studies with complex geometries. The results demonstrate uniform and homogeneous molten plastic distribution with minimal pressure loss during the filling phase. Importantly, this methodology does not require expert intervention, reducing time and costs associated with manual injection mold feed system design. It is also adaptable to various design environments and virtual twin systems, not tied to specific CAD software. The validated results surpass the state of the art, offering an agile alternative for digital twin applications in new product design environments, reducing dependence on experts, facilitating designer training, and ultimately cutting costs"
2507.21288,"Materials used in real clothing exhibit remarkable complexity and spatial variation due to common processes such as stitching, hemming, dyeing, printing, padding, and bonding. Simulating these materials, for instance using finite element methods, is often computationally demanding and slow. Worse, such methods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' that makes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework, called Mass-Spring Net, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate model that captures the effects of these complex materials using only motion observations. The cloth is discretized into a mass-spring network with unknown material parameters that are learned directly from the motion data, using a novel force-and-impulse loss function. Our approach demonstrates the ability to accurately model spatially varying material properties from a variety of data sources, and immunity to membrane locking which plagues FEM-based simulations. Compared to graph-based networks and neural ODE-based architectures, our method achieves significantly faster training times, higher reconstruction accuracy, and improved generalization to novel dynamic scenarios."
2507.21493,"3D creation has always been a unique human strength, driven by our ability to deconstruct and reassemble objects using our eyes, mind and hand. However, current 3D design tools struggle to replicate this natural process, requiring considerable artistic expertise and manual labor. This paper introduces BANG, a novel generative approach that bridges 3D generation and reasoning, allowing for intuitive and flexible part-level decomposition of 3D objects. At the heart of BANG is ""Generative Exploded Dynamics"", which creates a smooth sequence of exploded states for an input geometry, progressively separating parts while preserving their geometric and semantic coherence.BANG utilizes a pre-trained large-scale latent diffusion model, fine-tuned for exploded dynamics with a lightweight exploded view adapter, allowing precise control over the decomposition process. It also incorporates a temporal attention module to ensure smooth transitions and consistency across time. BANG enhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface regions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how. This interaction can be extended with multimodal models like GPT-4, enabling 2D-to-3D manipulations for more intuitive and creative workflows.The capabilities of BANG extend to generating detailed part-level geometry, associating parts with functional descriptions, and facilitating component-aware 3D creation and manufacturing workflows. Additionally, BANG offers applications in 3D printing, where separable parts are generated for easy printing and reassembly. In essence, BANG enables seamless transformation from imaginative concepts to detailed 3D assets, offering a new perspective on creation that resonates with human intuition."
2507.23002,"The proliferation of advanced tools for manipulating video has led to an arms race, pitting those who wish to sow disinformation against those who want to detect and expose it. Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this race, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those manipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider authentic (i.e., ""natural"") video. In this paper, we show how coding very subtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat this advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification. Our approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under coded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this watermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit only by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that our technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to solving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content creation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for protecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the content on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the illumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot."
2507.23777,"Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight, multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will be released."
2508.00398,"3D animation aims to generate a 3D animated video from an input image and a target 3D motion sequence. Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the creation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from conventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve artist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke patterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style properties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts, leading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a `stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks designed to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The stylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the stylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses encountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions. To this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for drawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be effective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate when occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides occlusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow, ensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF operates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving 2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory."
2508.00424,"The interactive visual analysis of set-typed data, i.e., data with attributes that are of type set, is a rewarding area of research and applications. Valuable prior work has contributed solutions that enable the study of such data with individual set-typed dimensions. In this paper, we present CrossSet, a novel method for the joint study of two set-typed dimensions and their interplay. Based on a task analysis, we describe a new, multi-scale approach to the interactive visual exploration and analysis of such data. Two set-typed data dimensions are jointly visualized using a hierarchical matrix layout, enabling the analysis of the interactions between two set-typed attributes at several levels, in addition to the analysis of individual such dimensions. CrossSet is anchored at a compact, large-scale overview that is complemented by drill-down opportunities to study the relations between and within the set-typed dimensions, enabling an interactive visual multi-scale exploration and analysis of bivariate set-typed data. Such an interactive approach makes it possible to study single set-typed dimensions in detail, to gain an overview of the interaction and association between two such dimensions, to refine one of the dimensions to gain additional details at several levels, and to drill down to the specific interactions of individual set-elements from the set-typed dimensions. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CrossSet, we have evaluated the new method in the context of several application scenarios."
2508.00428,"Text-to-3D (T23D) generation has transformed digital content creation, yet remains bottlenecked by blind trial-and-error prompting processes that yield unpredictable results. While visual prompt engineering has advanced in text-to-image domains, its application to 3D generation presents unique challenges requiring multi-view consistency evaluation and spatial understanding. We present Sel3DCraft, a visual prompt engineering system for T23D that transforms unstructured exploration into a guided visual process. Our approach introduces three key innovations: a dual-branch structure combining retrieval and generation for diverse candidate exploration; a multi-view hybrid scoring approach that leverages MLLMs with innovative high-level metrics to assess 3D models with human-expert consistency; and a prompt-driven visual analytics suite that enables intuitive defect identification and refinement. Extensive testing and user studies demonstrate that Sel3DCraft surpasses other T23D systems in supporting creativity for designers."
2508.00782,"Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts (VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment to the input audios."
2508.0095,"Human perception of graph drawings is influenced by a variety of impact factors for which quality measures are used as a proxy indicator. The investigation of those impact factors and their effects is important to evaluate and improve quality measures and drawing algorithms. The number of edge crossings in a 2D graph drawing has long been a main quality measure for drawing evaluation. The use of stereoscopic 3D graph visualisations has gained attraction over the last years, and results from several studies indicate that they can improve analysis efficiency for a range of analysis scenarios. While edge crossings can also occur in 3D, there are edge configurations in space that are not crossings but might be perceived as such from a specific viewpoint. Such configurations create crossings when projected on the corresponding 2D image plane and could impact readability similar to 2D crossings. In 3D drawings, the additional depth aspect and the subsequent impact factors of edge distance and relative edge direction in space might further influence the importance of those configurations for readability. We investigate the impact of such factors in an empirical study and report on findings of difference between major factor categories."
2508.01242,"We present MeshLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to understand and generate text-serialized 3D meshes. Our approach addresses key limitations in existing methods, including the limited dataset scale when catering to LLMs' token length and the loss of 3D structural information during mesh serialization. We introduce a Primitive-Mesh decomposition strategy, which divides 3D meshes into structurally meaningful subunits. This enables the creation of a large-scale dataset with 1500k+ samples, almost 50 times larger than previous methods, which aligns better with the LLM scaling law principles. Furthermore, we propose inferring face connectivity from vertices and local mesh assembly training strategies, significantly enhancing the LLMs' ability to capture mesh topology and spatial structures. Experiments show that MeshLLM outperforms the state-of-the-art LLaMA-Mesh in both mesh generation quality and shape understanding, highlighting its great potential in processing text-serialized 3D meshes."
2508.01381,"The reconstruction of multi-layer 3D garments typically requires expensive multi-view capture setups and specialized 3D editing efforts. To support the creation of life-like clothed human avatars, we introduce ReMu for reconstructing multi-layer clothed humans in a new setup, Image Layers, which captures a subject wearing different layers of clothing with a single RGB camera. To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified 3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner. Thus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate system defined by the canonical body pose. Afterwards, we introduce a collision-aware optimization process to address interpenetration and further refine the garment boundaries leveraging implicit neural fields. It is worth noting that our method is template-free and category-agnostic, which enables the reconstruction of 3D garments in diverse clothing styles. Through our experiments, we show that our method reconstructs nearly penetration-free 3D clothed humans and achieves competitive performance compared to category-specific methods.

2508.0159,"In-betweening human motion generation aims to synthesize intermediate motions that transition between user-specified keyframes. In addition to maintaining smooth transitions, a crucial requirement of this task is to generate diverse motion sequences. It is still challenging to maintain diversity, particularly when it is necessary for the motions within a generated batch sampling to differ meaningfully from one another due to complex motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel method, termed the Multi-Criteria Guidance with In-Betweening Motion Model (MCG-IMM), for in-betweening human motion generation. A key strength of MCG-IMM lies in its plug-and-play nature: it enhances the diversity of motions generated by pretrained models without introducing additional parameters This is achieved by providing a sampling process of pretrained generative models with multi-criteria guidance. Specifically, MCG-IMM reformulates the sampling process of pretrained generative model as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and introduces an optimization process to explore motion sequences that satisfy multiple criteria, e.g., diversity and smoothness. Moreover, our proposed plug-and-play multi-criteria guidance is compatible with different families of generative models, including denoised diffusion probabilistic models, variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Experiments on four popular human motion datasets demonstrate that MCG-IMM consistently state-of-the-art methods in in-betweening motion generation task."
2508.02443,"In this work, we present a novel method for uncertainty estimation (UE) in Gaussian Splatting. UE is crucial for using Gaussian Splatting in critical applications such as robotics and medicine. Previous methods typically estimate the variance of Gaussian primitives and use the rendering process to obtain pixel-wise uncertainties. Our method establishes primitive representations of error and visibility of trainings views, which carries meaningful uncertainty information. This representation is obtained by projection of training error and visibility onto the primitives. Uncertainties of novel views are obtained by rendering the primitive representations of uncertainty for those novel views, yielding uncertainty feature maps. To aggregate these uncertainty feature maps of novel views, we perform a pixel-wise regression on holdout data. In our experiments, we analyze the different components of our method, investigating various combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression models. Furthermore, we considered the effect of separating splatting into foreground and background. Our UEs show high correlations to true errors, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially on foreground objects. The trained regression models show generalization capabilities to new scenes, allowing uncertainty estimation without the need for holdout data."
2508.03445,"Voronoi treemaps are used to depict nodes and their hierarchical relationships simultaneously. However, in addition to the hierarchical structure, data attributes, such as co-occurring features or similarities, frequently exist. Examples include geographical attributes like shared borders between countries or contextualized semantic information such as embedding vectors derived from large language models. In this work, we introduce a Voronoi treemap algorithm that leverages data similarity to generate neighborhood-preserving treemaps. First, we extend the treemap layout pipeline to consider similarity during data preprocessing. We then use a Kuhn-Munkres matching of similarities to centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) cells to create initial Voronoi diagrams with equal cell sizes for each level. Greedy swapping is used to improve the neighborhoods of cells to match the data's similarity further. During optimization, cell areas are iteratively adjusted to their respective sizes while preserving the existing neighborhoods. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach through multiple real-world examples drawn from infographics and linguistics. To quantitatively assess the resulting treemaps, we employ treemap metrics and measure neighborhood preservation."
2508.03457,"The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation."
2508.04078,"Hyperparameter tuning in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a labor-intensive and expert-driven process, often resulting in inconsistent reconstructions and suboptimal results. We propose RLGS, a plug-and-play reinforcement learning framework for adaptive hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS through lightweight policy modules, dynamically adjusting critical hyperparameters such as learning rates and densification thresholds. The framework is model-agnostic and seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS pipelines without architectural modifications. We demonstrate its generalization ability across multiple state-of-the-art 3DGS variants, including Taming-3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC, and validate its robustness across diverse datasets. RLGS consistently enhances rendering quality. For example, it improves Taming-3DGS by 0.7dB PSNR on the Tanks and Temple (TNT) dataset, under a fixed Gaussian budget, and continues to yield gains even when baseline performance saturates. Our results suggest that RLGS provides an effective and general solution for automating hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS training, bridging a gap in applying reinforcement learning to 3DGS."
2508.04326,"The development of radiance fields (RF), such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), has revolutionized interactive photorealistic view synthesis and presents enormous opportunities for XR research and applications. However, despite the exponential growth of RF research, RF-related contributions to the XR community remain sparse. To better understand this research gap, we performed a systematic survey of current RF literature to analyze (i) how RF is envisioned for XR applications, (ii) how they have already been implemented, and (iii) the remaining research gaps. We collected 365 RF contributions related to XR from computer vision, computer graphics, robotics, multimedia, human-computer interaction, and XR communities, seeking to answer the above research questions. Among the 365 papers, we performed an analysis of 66 papers that already addressed a detailed aspect of RF research for XR. With this survey, we extended and positioned XR-specific RF research topics in the broader RF research field and provide a helpful resource for the XR community to navigate within the rapid development of RF research."
2508.04508,"Current multi-view 3D reconstruction methods rely on accurate camera calibration and pose estimation, requiring complex and time-intensive pre-processing that hinders their practical deployment. To address this challenge, we introduce Surf3R, an end-to-end feedforward approach that reconstructs 3D surfaces from sparse views without estimating camera poses and completes an entire scene in under 10 seconds. Our method employs a multi-branch and multi-view decoding architecture in which multiple reference views jointly guide the reconstruction process. Through the proposed branch-wise processing, cross-view attention, and inter-branch fusion, the model effectively captures complementary geometric cues without requiring camera calibration. Moreover, we introduce a D-Normal regularizer based on an explicit 3D Gaussian representation for surface reconstruction. It couples surface normals with other geometric parameters to jointly optimize the 3D geometry, significantly improving 3D consistency and surface detail accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Surf3R achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple surface reconstruction metrics on ScanNet++ and Replica datasets, exhibiting excellent generalization and efficiency."
2508.04687,"Our purpose is to improve performance-based animation which can drive believable 3D stylized characters that are truly perceptual. By combining traditional blendshape animation techniques with multiple machine learning models, we present both non-real time and real time solutions which drive character expressions in a geometrically consistent and perceptually valid way. For the non-real time system, we propose a 3D emotion transfer network makes use of a 2D human image to generate a stylized 3D rig parameters. For the real time system, we propose a blendshape adaption network which generates the character rig parameter motions with geometric consistency and temporally stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by comparing to a commercial product Faceware. Results reveal that ratings of the recognition, intensity, and attractiveness of expressions depicted for animated characters via our systems are statistically higher than Faceware. Our results may be implemented into the animation pipeline, and provide animators with a system for creating the expressions they wish to use more quickly and accurately."
2508.04825,"Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization."
2508.04965,"Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in real-time and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However, traditional 3DGS representations often struggle with large-scale scene management and efficient storage, particularly when dealing with complex environments or limited computational resources. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel perceive-sample-compress framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, we propose a scene perception compensation algorithm that intelligently refines Gaussian parameters at each level. This algorithm intelligently prioritizes visual importance for higher fidelity rendering in critical areas, while optimizing resource usage and improving overall visible quality. Furthermore, we propose a pyramid sampling representation to manage Gaussian primitives across hierarchical levels. Finally, to facilitate efficient storage of proposed hierarchical pyramid representations, we develop a Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression algorithm to achieve significant compression ratios without sacrificing visual fidelity. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves memory efficiency and high visual quality while maintaining real-time rendering speed."
2508.04966,"While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in static scene modeling, its extension to dynamic scenes introduces significant challenges. Existing dynamic 3DGS methods suffer from either over-smoothing due to low-rank decomposition or feature collision from high-dimensional grid sampling. This is because of the inherent spectral conflicts between preserving motion details and maintaining deformation consistency at different frequency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dynamic 3DGS framework with hybrid explicit-implicit functions. Our approach contains three key innovations: a spectral-aware Laplacian encoding architecture which merges Hash encoding and Laplacian-based module for flexible frequency motion control, an enhanced Gaussian dynamics attribute that compensates for photometric distortions caused by geometric deformation, and an adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree-based primitive control to efficiently query and optimize dynamic areas. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex dynamic scenes, achieving better reconstruction fidelity."
2508.05064,"Gaussian Splatting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technique for real-time 3D scene representation, offering a highly efficient and expressive alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Its ability to render complex scenes with high fidelity has enabled progress across domains such as scene reconstruction, robotics, and interactive content creation. More recently, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and language embeddings into Gaussian Splatting pipelines has opened new possibilities for text-conditioned generation, editing, and semantic scene understanding. Despite these advances, a comprehensive overview of this emerging intersection has been lacking. This survey presents a structured review of current research efforts that combine language guidance with 3D Gaussian Splatting, detailing theoretical foundations, integration strategies, and real-world use cases.

2508.05115,"Audio-driven portrait animation aims to synthesize realistic and natural talking head videos from an input audio signal and a single reference image. While existing methods achieve high-quality results by leveraging high-dimensional intermediate representations and explicitly modeling motion dynamics, their computational complexity renders them unsuitable for real-time deployment. Real-time inference imposes stringent latency and memory constraints, often necessitating the use of highly compressed latent representations. However, operating in such compact spaces hinders the preservation of fine-grained spatiotemporal details, thereby complicating audio-visual synchronization RAP (Real-time Audio-driven Portrait animation), a unified framework for generating high-quality talking portraits under real-time constraints. Specifically, RAP introduces a hybrid attention mechanism for fine-grained audio control, and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm that avoids explicit motion supervision. Through these techniques, RAP achieves precise audio-driven control, mitigates long-term temporal drift, and maintains high visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves state-of-the-art performance while operating under real-time constraints."

To address this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel density control method, which exploits the volumes of inertia associated to each Gaussian function to guide the refinement process. Furthermore, we study the effect of both traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) and Deep Image Matching (DIM) methods for point cloud initialization. Extensive experimental evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses 3DGS in reconstruction quality, delivering encouraging performance across diverse scenes."
2508.05524,"Reeb graphs are an important tool for abstracting and representing the topological structure of a function defined on a manifold. We have identified three properties for faithfully representing Reeb graphs in a visualization: they should be constrained to the boundary, compact, and aligned with the function gradient. Existing algorithms for drawing Reeb graphs are agnostic to or violate these properties. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to generate Reeb graph visualizations, called GASP, that is cognizant of these properties, thereby producing visualizations that are more representative of the underlying data. To demonstrate the improvements, the resulting Reeb graphs are evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively against the geometric barycenter algorithm, using its implementation available in the Topology ToolKit (TTK), a widely adopted tool for calculating and visualizing Reeb graphs."
2508.05531,"3D Cloth modeling and simulation is essential for avatars creation in several fields, such as fashion, entertainment, and animation. Achieving high-quality results is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially in the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more accuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic information that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction pipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying the semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are designed for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is devoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation is a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the underlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers with strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide disjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation paradigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different layers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the unseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer above. We name this segmentation paradigm clothed human layering. We create a new synthetic dataset that simulates very realistic 3D scans with the ground truth of the involved clothing layers. We propose and evaluate different neural network settings to deal with 3D clothing layering. We considered both coarse and fine grained per-layer garment identification. Our experiments demonstrates the benefit in introducing proper strategies for the segmentation on the garment domain on both the synthetic and real-world scan datasets."
2508.05626,"We present a self-supervised approach to in-the-wild image relighting that enables fully controllable, physically based illumination editing. We achieve this by combining the physical accuracy of traditional rendering with the photorealistic appearance made possible by neural rendering. Our pipeline works by inferring a colored mesh representation of a given scene using monocular estimates of geometry and intrinsic components. This representation allows users to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under the new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine. We send this approximate rendering of the scene through a feed-forward neural renderer to predict the final photorealistic relighting result. We develop a differentiable rendering process to reconstruct in-the-wild scene illumination, enabling self-supervised training of our neural renderer on raw image collections. Our method represents a significant step in bringing the explicit physical control over lights available in typical 3D computer graphics tools, such as Blender, to in-the-wild relighting."
2508.05685,"Transfer learning of diffusion models to smaller target domains is challenging, as naively fine-tuning the model often results in poor generalization. Test-time guidance methods help mitigate this by offering controllable improvements in image fidelity through a trade-off with sample diversity. However, this benefit comes at a high computational cost, typically requiring dual forward passes during sampling. We propose the Domain-guided Fine-tuning (DogFit) method, an effective guidance mechanism for diffusion transfer learning that maintains controllability without incurring additional computational overhead. DogFit injects a domain-aware guidance offset into the training loss, effectively internalizing the guided behavior during the fine-tuning process. The domain-aware design is motivated by our observation that during fine-tuning, the unconditional source model offers a stronger marginal estimate than the target model. To support efficient controllable fidelity-diversity trade-offs at inference, we encode the guidance strength value as an additional model input through a lightweight conditioning mechanism. We further investigate the optimal placement and timing of the guidance offset during training and propose two simple scheduling strategies, i.e., late-start and cut-off, which improve generation quality and training stability. Experiments on DiT and SiT backbones across six diverse target domains show that DogFit can outperform prior guidance methods in transfer learning in terms of FID and FDDINOV2 while requiring up to 2x fewer sampling TFLOPS."
2508.06086,"Recent research has focused on incorporating media into living environments via color-controlled materials and image display. In particular, grass-based displays have drawn attention as landscape-friendly interactive interfaces. To develop the grass display, it is important to obtain the grass color change characteristics that depend on the real environment. However, conventional methods require experiments on actual equipment every time the lighting or viewpoint changes, which is time-consuming and costly. Although research has begun on simulating grass colors, this approach still faces significant issues as it takes many hours for a single measurement. In this paper, we explore an interactive simulation of a grass display color change characteristic based on real-world conditions in a virtual environment. We evaluated our method's accuracy by simulating grass color characteristics across multiple viewpoints and environments, and then compared the results against prior work. The results indicated that our method tended to simulate the grass color characteristics similar to the actual characteristics and showed the potential to do so more quickly and with comparable accuracy to the previous study."
2508.0724,"Traditional physically-based material models rely on analytically derived bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs), typically by considering statistics of micro-primitives such as facets, flakes, or spheres, sometimes combined with multi-bounce interactions such as layering and multiple scattering. These derivations are often complex and model-specific, and typically consider a statistical aggregate of a large surface area, ignoring spatial variation. Once an analytic BRDF's evaluation is defined, one still needs to design an importance sampling method for it, and a way to evaluate the pdf of that sampling distribution, requiring further model-specific derivations. We present PureSample: a novel neural BRDF representation that allows learning a material's behavior purely by sampling forward random walks on the microgeometry, which is usually straightforward to implement. Our representation allows for efficient importance sampling, pdf evaluation, and BRDF evaluation, for homogeneous as well as spatially varying materials. We achieve this by two learnable components: first, the sampling distribution is modeled using a flow matching neural network, which allows both importance sampling and pdf evaluation; second, we introduce a view-dependent albedo term, captured by a lightweight neural network, which allows for converting a scalar pdf value to a colored BRDF value for any pair of view and light directions. We demonstrate PureSample on challenging materials, including multi-layered materials, multiple-scattering microfacet materials, and various other microstructures."
2508.07615,"The criteria for determining graph isomorphism are crucial for solving graph isomorphism problems. The necessary condition is that two isomorphic graphs possess invariants, but their function can only be used to filtrate and subdivide candidate spaces. The sufficient conditions are used to rebuild the isomorphic reconstruction of special graphs, but their drawback is that the isomorphic functions of subgraphs may not form part of the isomorphic functions of the parent graph. The use of sufficient or necessary conditions generally results in backtracking to ensure the correctness of the decision algorithm. The sufficient and necessary conditions can ensure that the determination of graph isomorphism does not require backtracking, but the correctness of its proof process is difficult to guarantee. This article proposes a verification method that can correctly determine whether the judgment conditions proposed by previous researchers are sufficient and necessary conditions. A subdivision method has also been proposed in this article, which can obtain more subdivisions for necessary conditions and effectively reduce the size of backtracking space."
2508.07852,"Recent research on learnable neural representations has been widely adopted in the field of 3D scene reconstruction and neural rendering applications. However, traditional feature grid representations often suffer from substantial memory footprint, posing a significant bottleneck for modern parallel computing hardware. In this paper, we present neural vertex features, a generalized formulation of learnable representation for neural rendering tasks involving explicit mesh surfaces. Instead of uniformly distributing neural features throughout 3D space, our method stores learnable features directly at mesh vertices, leveraging the underlying geometry as a compact and structured representation for neural processing. This not only optimizes memory efficiency, but also improves feature representation by aligning compactly with the surface using task-specific geometric priors. We validate our neural representation across diverse neural rendering tasks, with a specific emphasis on neural radiosity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces memory consumption to only one-fifth (or even less) of grid-based representations, while maintaining comparable rendering quality and lowering inference overhead."
2508.08198,"The ability to engineer complex three-dimensional shapes from planar sheets with precise, programmable control underpins emerging technologies in soft robotics, reconfigurable devices, and functional materials. Here, we present a reduced-order numerical and experimental framework for a bilayer system consisting of a stimuli-responsive thermoplastic sheet (Shrinky Dink) bonded to a kirigami-patterned, inert plastic layer. Upon uniform heating, the active layer contracts while the patterned layer constrains in-plane stretch but allows out-of-plane bending, yielding programmable 3D morphologies from simple planar precursors. Our approach enables efficient computational design and scalable manufacturing of 3D forms with a single-layer reduced model that captures the coupled mechanics of stretching and bending. Unlike traditional bilayer modeling, our framework collapses the multilayer composite into a single layer of nodes and elements, reducing the degrees of freedom and enabling simulation on a 2D geometry. This is achieved by introducing a novel energy formulation that captures the coupling between in-plane stretch mismatch and out-of-plane bending - extending beyond simple isotropic linear elastic models. Experimentally, we establish a fully planar, repeatable fabrication protocol using a stimuli-responsive thermoplastic and a laser-cut inert plastic layer. The programmed strain mismatch drives an array of 3D morphologies, such as bowls, canoes, and flower petals, all verified by both simulation and physical prototypes."
2508.08228,"We present LL3M, a multi-agent system that leverages pretrained large language models (LLMs) to generate 3D assets by writing interpretable Python code in Blender. We break away from the typical generative approach that learns from a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a code-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration with artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of specialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender scripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code works as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented representation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender constructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse, unconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues for further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or procedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our system: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while iterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared code context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a retrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API documentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions empowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LL3M across diverse shape categories, style and material edits, and user-driven refinements. Our experiments showcase the power of code as a generative and interpretable medium for 3D asset creation. Our project page is atthis https URL."
2508.08384,"Indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video remains a challenge due to its highly ill-posed nature, especially when the lighting condition of the scene varies spatially and temporally. We propose a method that estimates from an input video a continuous light field describing the spatiotemporally varying lighting of the scene. We leverage 2D diffusion priors for optimizing such light field represented as a MLP. To enable zero-shot generalization to in-the-wild scenes, we fine-tune a pre-trained image diffusion model to predict lighting at multiple locations by jointly inpainting multiple chrome balls as light probes. We evaluate our method on indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video and show superior performance over compared baselines. Most importantly, we highlight results on spatiotemporally consistent lighting estimation from in-the-wild videos, which is rarely demonstrated in previous works."
2508.08429,"In this paper, we consider retargeting a tracked facial performance to either another person or to a virtual character in a game or virtual reality (VR) environment. We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and retargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same framework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does not constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to another, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when retargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to fit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen set of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion signatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of Simon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting, we argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says expressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character rig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions when exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these well-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a performance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned inverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry reconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig used by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically meaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order to better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit differentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially non-differentiable) black box."
2508.08542,"Point cloud capture processes are error-prone and introduce noisy artifacts that necessitate filtering/denoising. Recent filtering methods often suffer from point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose Hybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both short-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is well established that short range scores, given by $\nabla_{x}\log p(x_t)$, may provide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying clean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant displacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the corresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as intermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our intuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide the short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn, score models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface. Specifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule, each consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for short-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores, guided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point distributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss function to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an end-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement based methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic graph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art results while enabling faster inference speed."
2508.08561,"This paper presents a study of computation and morphology of Louis Kahn City Tower project. The City Tower is an unbuilt design by Louis I. Kahn and Anne Tyng that integrates form and structure using 3D space triangular geometries. Although never built, the City Tower geometrical framework anticipated later developments in design of space-frame structures. Initially envisioned in the 1950s, the City Tower project is a skyscraper structure based on a tetrahedral and octahedral space frame called Octet-Truss. The aim of this study is to analyze the geometry of the City Tower structure and how it can be used to develop modular and adaptable architectural forms. The study is based on an analytical shape grammar that is used to recreate the original structure, and later to generate new structural configurations based on the City Tower's morphology. This study also investigates the potential applications of these findings in architecture and reveals the possibilities of using tetrahedrons and octahedrons as fundamental geometries for creating scalable and modular designs and presents initial findings."
2508.08572,"This paper presents a study on using Radiolaria as a basis for generation of space-based geometry for structural design with shape grammars. Radiolaria has been a source of inspiration for architectural design with its intricate structural features and geometric patterns (Lim, 2012). We use the basis of the Radiolaria geometry to create a generative shape grammar as a computational system; then use the shape grammar to create spatial configurations for potential applications in design of 3D space structural frames. This study begins with the geometric analysis of Radiolaria and the dissection of its structure and geometry into a simplified morphological source, in this case a tetrahedral structure. Tetrahedrons are used in combination with octahedrons to generate spatial configurations to generate 3D spatial structural frames. The paper presents the Radiolaria spatial analysis, the shape grammar, the collection of generated designs, and possible applications in space frame structures."
2508.08754,"With the advent of diffusion models, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has seen substantial advancements. Current T2I models allow users to specify object colors using linguistic color names, and some methods aim to personalize color-object association through prompt learning. However, existing models struggle to provide comprehensive control over the color schemes of an entire image, especially for background elements and less prominent objects not explicitly mentioned in prompts. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance color scheme control by integrating color palettes as a separate guidance mechanism alongside prompt instructions. We investigate the effectiveness of palette guidance by exploring various palette representation methods within a diffusion-based image colorization framework. To facilitate this exploration, we construct specialized palette-text-image datasets and conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our results demonstrate that incorporating palette guidance significantly improves the model's ability to generate images with desired color schemes, enabling a more controlled and refined colorization process."
2508.08826,"Real-time rendering with global illumination is crucial to afford the user realistic experience in virtual environments. We present a learning-based estimator to predict diffuse indirect illumination in screen space, which then is combined with direct illumination to synthesize globally-illuminated high dynamic range (HDR) results. Our approach tackles the challenges of capturing long-range/long-distance indirect illumination when employing neural networks and is generalized to handle complex lighting and scenarios.From the neural network thinking of the solver to the rendering equation, we present a novel network architecture to predict indirect illumination. Our network is equipped with a modified attention mechanism that aggregates global information guided by spacial geometry features, as well as a monochromatic design that encodes each color channel individually.We conducted extensive evaluations, and the experimental results demonstrate our superiority over previous learning-based techniques. Our approach excels at handling complex lighting such as varying-colored lighting and environment lighting. It can successfully capture distant indirect illumination and simulates the interreflections between textured surfaces well (i.e., color bleeding effects); it can also effectively handle new scenes that are not present in the training dataset."
2508.08831,"We introduce DiffPhysCam, a differentiable camera simulator designed to support robotics and embodied AI applications by enabling gradient-based optimization in visual perception pipelines. Generating synthetic images that closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins, facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using images generated by DiffPhysCam."
2508.0893,"Natural head rotation is critical for believable embodied virtual agents, yet this micro-level behavior remains largely underexplored. While head-rotation prediction algorithms could, in principle, reproduce this behavior, they typically focus on visually salient stimuli and overlook the cognitive motives that guide head rotation. This yields agents that look at conspicuous objects while overlooking obstacles or task-relevant cues, diminishing realism in a virtual environment. We introduce SCORE, a Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning framework for Embodied Head Rotation, a data-agnostic framework that produces context-aware head movements without task-specific training or hand-tuned heuristics. A controlled VR study (N=20) identifies five motivational drivers of human head movements: Interest, Information Seeking, Safety, Social Schema, and Habit. SCORE encodes these drivers as symbolic predicates, perceives the scene with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and plans head poses with a Large Language Model (LLM). The framework employs a hybrid workflow: the VLM-LLM reasoning is executed offline, after which a lightweight FastVLM performs online validation to suppress hallucinations while maintaining responsiveness to scene dynamics. The result is an agent that predicts not only where to look but also why, generalizing to unseen scenes and multi-agent crowds while retaining behavioral plausibility."
2508.09062,"We introduce VertexRegen, a novel mesh generation framework that enables generation at a continuous level of detail. Existing autoregressive methods generate meshes in a partial-to-complete manner and thus intermediate steps of generation represent incomplete structures. VertexRegen takes inspiration from progressive meshes and reformulates the process as the reversal of edge collapse, i.e. vertex split, learned through a generative model. Experimental results demonstrate that VertexRegen produces meshes of comparable quality to state-of-the-art methods while uniquely offering anytime generation with the flexibility to halt at any step to yield valid meshes with varying levels of detail."
2508.09131,"Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved problem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including albedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical consistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions. Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency. Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1 Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages, particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally, our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility."
2508.09235,"In this paper, we present a novel compression framework, TFZ, that preserves the topology of 2D symmetric and asymmetric second-order tensor fields defined on flat triangular meshes. A tensor field assigns a tensor - a multi-dimensional array of numbers - to each point in space. Tensor fields, such as the stress and strain tensors, and the Riemann curvature tensor, are essential to both science and engineering. The topology of tensor fields captures the core structure of data, and is useful in various disciplines, such as graphics (for manipulating shapes and textures) and neuroscience (for analyzing brain structures from diffusion MRI). Lossy data compression may distort the topology of tensor fields, thus hindering downstream analysis and visualization tasks. TFZ ensures that certain topological features are preserved during lossy compression. Specifically, TFZ preserves degenerate points essential to the topology of symmetric tensor fields and retains eigenvector and eigenvalue graphs that represent the topology of asymmetric tensor fields. TFZ scans through each cell, preserving the local topology of each cell, and thereby ensuring certain global topological guarantees. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing the lossy scientific data compressors SZ3 and SPERR."
2508.0961,"In 3D reconstruction of underwater scenes, traditional methods based on atmospheric optical models cannot effectively deal with the selective attenuation of light wavelengths and the effect of suspended particle scattering, which are unique to the water medium, and lead to color distortion, geometric artifacts, and collapsing phenomena at long distances. We propose the DualPhys-GS framework to achieve high-quality underwater reconstruction through a dual-path optimization mechanism. Our approach further develops a dual feature-guided attenuation-scattering modeling mechanism, the RGB-guided attenuation optimization model combines RGB features and depth information and can handle edge and structural details. In contrast, the multi-scale depth-aware scattering model captures scattering effects at different scales using a feature pyramid network and an attention mechanism. Meanwhile, we design several special loss functions. The attenuation scattering consistency loss ensures physical consistency. The water body type adaptive loss dynamically adjusts the weighting coefficients. The edge-aware scattering loss is used to maintain the sharpness of structural edges. The multi-scale feature loss helps to capture global and local structural information. In addition, we design a scene adaptive mechanism that can automatically identify the water-body-type characteristics (e.g., clear coral reef waters or turbid coastal waters) and dynamically adjust the scattering and attenuation parameters and optimization strategies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods in several metrics, especially in suspended matter-dense regions and long-distance scenes, and the reconstruction quality is significantly improved."
2508.10201,"Multimodal large language models (mLLMs), trained in a mixed modal setting as a universal model, have been shown to compete with or even outperform many specialized algorithms for imaging and graphics tasks. As demonstrated across many applications, mLLMs' ability to jointly process image and text data makes them suitable for zero-shot applications or efficient fine-tuning towards specialized tasks. However, they have had limited success in 3D analysis and editing tasks. This is due to both the lack of suitable (annotated) 3D data as well as the idiosyncrasies of 3D representations. In this paper, we investigate whether mLLMs can be adapted to support high-level editing of Boundary Representation (B-rep) CAD objects. B-reps remain the industry-standard for precisely encoding engineering objects, but are challenging as the representation is fragile (i.e. can easily lead to invalid CAD objects) and no publicly available data source exists with semantically-annotated B-reps or CAD construction history. We present B-repLer as a finetuned mLLM that can understand text prompts and make semantic edits on given B-Reps to produce valid outputs. We enable this via a novel multimodal architecture, specifically designed to handle B-rep models, and demonstrate how existing CAD tools, in conjunction with mLLMs, can be used to automatically generate the required reasoning dataset, without relying on external annotations. We extensively evaluate B-repLer and demonstrate several text-based B-rep edits of various complexity, which were not previously possible."
2508.11177,"Recent deep learning methods can generate diverse graphic design layouts efficiently. However, these methods often create layouts with flaws, such as misalignment, unwanted overlaps, and unsatisfied containment. To tackle this issue, we propose an optimization-based method called LayoutRectifier, which gracefully rectifies auto-generated graphic design layouts to reduce these flaws while minimizing deviation from the generated layout. The core of our method is a two-stage optimization. First, we utilize grid systems, which professional designers commonly use to organize elements, to mitigate misalignments through discrete search. Second, we introduce a novel box containment function designed to adjust the positions and sizes of the layout elements, preventing unwanted overlapping and promoting desired containment. We evaluate our method on content-agnostic and content-aware layout generation tasks and achieve better-quality layouts that are more suitable for downstream graphic design tasks. Our method complements learning-based layout generation methods and does not require additional training."
2508.11203,"We introduce StyleMM, a novel framework that can construct a stylized 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) based on user-defined text descriptions specifying a target style. Building upon a pre-trained mesh deformation network and a texture generator for original 3DMM-based realistic human faces, our approach fine-tunes these models using stylized facial images generated via text-guided image-to-image (i2i) translation with a diffusion model, which serve as stylization targets for the rendered mesh. To prevent undesired changes in identity, facial alignment, or expressions during i2i translation, we introduce a stylization method that explicitly preserves the facial attributes of the source image. By maintaining these critical attributes during image stylization, the proposed approach ensures consistent 3D style transfer across the 3DMM parameter space through image-based training. Once trained, StyleMM enables feed-forward generation of stylized face meshes with explicit control over shape, expression, and texture parameters, producing meshes with consistent vertex connectivity and animatability. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of identity-level facial diversity and stylization capability.

2508.11476,"Although recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at aligning generated images with textual prompts, controlling the visual style of the output remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose Style-Prompting Guidance (SPG), a novel sampling strategy for style-specific image generation. SPG constructs a style noise vector and leverages its directional deviation from unconditional noise to guide the diffusion process toward the target style distribution. By integrating SPG with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), our method achieves both semantic fidelity and style consistency. SPG is simple, robust, and compatible with controllable frameworks like ControlNet and IPAdapter, making it practical and widely applicable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code is available atthis https URL."
2508.11695,"The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) techniques has unlocked opportunities in generating diverse and compelling advertising images based on referenced product images and textual scene descriptions. This capability substantially reduces human labor and production costs in traditional marketing workflows. However, existing AIGC techniques either demand extensive fine-tuning for each referenced image to achieve high fidelity, or they struggle to maintain fidelity across diverse products, making them impractical for e-commerce and marketing industries. To tackle this limitation, we first construct AdProd-100K, a large-scale advertising image generation dataset. A key innovation in its construction is our dual data augmentation strategy, which fosters robust, 3D-aware representations crucial for realistic and high-fidelity image synthesis. Leveraging this dataset, we propose RefAdGen, a generation framework that achieves high fidelity through a decoupled design. The framework enforces precise spatial control by injecting a product mask at the U-Net input, and employs an efficient Attention Fusion Module (AFM) to integrate product features. This design effectively resolves the fidelity-efficiency dilemma present in existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RefAdGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, showcasing robust generalization by maintaining high fidelity and remarkable visual results for both unseen products and challenging real-world, in-the-wild images. This offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional workflows. Code and datasets are publicly available atthis https URL."
2508.11722,"Many Material Point Method implementations favor explicit time integration. However large time steps are often desirable for special reasons - for example, for partitioned coupling with another large-step solver, or for imposing constraints, projections, or multiphysics solves. We present a simple, plug-and-play algorithm that advances MPM with a large time step using substeps, effectively wrapping an explicit MPM integrator into a pseudo-implicit one."
2508.12179,"Mesh processing pipelines are mature, but adapting them to newer non-mesh surface representations -- which enable fast rendering with compact file size -- requires costly meshing or transmitting bulky meshes, negating their core benefits for streaming applications.We present a compact neural field that enables common geometry processing tasks across diverse surface representations. Given an input surface, our method learns a neural map from its coarse mesh approximation to the surface. The full representation totals only a few hundred kilobytes, making it ideal for lightweight transmission. Our method enables fast extraction of manifold and Delaunay meshes for intrinsic shape analysis, and compresses scalar fields for efficient delivery of costly precomputed results. Experiments and applications show that our fast, compact, and accurate approach opens up new possibilities for interactive geometry processing."
2508.12438,"Dynamic facial expression generation from natural language is a crucial task in Computer Graphics, with applications in Animation, Virtual Avatars, and Human-Computer Interaction. However, current generative models suffer from datasets that are either speech-driven or limited to coarse emotion labels, lacking the nuanced, expressive descriptions needed for fine-grained control, and were captured using elaborate and expensive equipment. We hence present a new dataset of facial motion sequences featuring nuanced performances and semantic annotation. The data is easily collected using commodity equipment and LLM-generated natural language instructions, in the popular ARKit blendshape format. This provides riggable motion, rich with expressive performances and labels. We accordingly train two baseline models, and evaluate their performance for future benchmarking. Using our Express4D dataset, the trained models can learn meaningful text-to-expression motion generation and capture the many-to-many mapping of the two modalities.

2508.12691,"Leveraging the Transformer architecture and the diffusion process, video DiT models have emerged as a dominant approach for high-quality video generation. However, their multi-step iterative denoising process incurs high computational cost and inference latency. Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in DiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip computations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless, existing caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies, struggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible manner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based framework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the interference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then introduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching should be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for dynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on diverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video generation (e.g., 1.94$\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\times$ speedup on HunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference efficiency compared to baseline methods."
2508.13228,"This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene surfaces from RGB-D sequences in a short time. The method integrates RGB, depth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance. Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP (Preconditioning Multilayer Perceptron) is introduced for voxel pre-rendering, allowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better distinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic modeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of precision, reducing training time while enhancing scene understanding. Experiments on seven synthetic scenes with six evaluation metrics show that PreSem-Surf achieves the best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU, while maintaining competitive results in NC, Accuracy, and Completeness, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability."
2508.13386,"We present a multi-level elastodynamics timestep solver for accelerating incremental potential contact (IPC) simulations. Our method retains the robustness of gold standard IPC in the face of intricate geometry, complex heterogeneous material distributions and high resolution input data without sacrificing visual fidelity (per-timestep relative displacement error of $\approx1\%$). The success of our method is enabled by a novel, sparse, geometry- and material-aware basis construction method which allows for the use of fast preconditioned conjugate gradient solvers (in place of a sparse direct solver), but without suffering convergence issues due to stiff or heterogeneous materials. The end result is a solver that produces results visually indistinguishable and quantitatively very close to gold-standard IPC methods but up to $13\times$ faster on identical hardware."
2508.13738,"The boundary-constrained floor plan generation problem aims to generate the topological and geometric properties of a set of rooms within a given boundary. Recently, learning-based methods have made significant progress in generating realistic floor plans. However, these methods involve a workflow of converting vector data into raster images, using image-based generative models, and then converting the results back into vector data. This process is complex and redundant, often resulting in information loss. Raster images, unlike vector data, cannot scale without losing detail and precision. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep learning framework called DiffPlanner for boundary-constrained floor plan generation, which operates entirely in vector space. Our framework is a Transformer-based conditional diffusion model that integrates an alignment mechanism in training, aligning the optimization trajectory of the model with the iterative design processes of designers. This enables our model to handle complex vector data, better fit the distribution of the predicted targets, accomplish the challenging task of floor plan layout design, and achieve user-controllable generation. We conduct quantitative comparisons, qualitative evaluations, ablation experiments, and perceptual studies to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffPlanner surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in generating floor plans and bubble diagrams in the creative stages, offering more controllability to users and producing higher-quality results that closely match the ground truths."
2508.13797,"Recent video editing methods achieve attractive results in style transfer or appearance modification. However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code: http://http://geometrylearning.com/Sketch3DVE/"
2508.13808,"Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its prominent implicit 3D representation and realistic novel view synthesis capabilities. Available works unexceptionally employ straight-line volume rendering, which struggles to handle sophisticated lightpath scenarios and introduces geometric ambiguities during training, particularly evident when processing motion-blurred images. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel deblur neural radiance field, Is-NeRF, featuring explicit lightpath modeling in real-world environments. By unifying six common light propagation phenomena through an in-scattering representation, we establish a new scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline adaptable to complex lightpaths. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy that enables autonomous determining of scattering directions and sampling intervals to capture finer object details. The proposed network jointly optimizes NeRF parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions to recover fine-grained scene representations from blurry images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that it effectively handles complex real-world scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate geometric details."
2508.14411,"Inverse rendering aims to reconstruct geometry and reflectance from captured images. Display-camera imaging systems offer unique advantages for this task: each pixel can easily function as a programmable point light source, and the polarized light emitted by LCD displays facilitates diffuse-specular separation. Despite these benefits, there is currently no public real-world dataset captured using display-camera systems, unlike other setups such as light stages. This absence hinders the development and evaluation of display-based inverse rendering methods. In this paper, we introduce the first real-world dataset for display-based inverse rendering. To achieve this, we construct and calibrate an imaging system comprising an LCD display and stereo polarization cameras. We then capture a diverse set of objects with diverse geometry and reflectance under one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) display patterns. We also provide high-quality ground-truth geometry. Our dataset enables the synthesis of captured images under arbitrary display patterns and different noise levels. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing photometric stereo and inverse rendering methods, and provide a simple, yet effective baseline for display inverse rendering, outperforming state-of-the-art inverse rendering methods.

2508.14879,"Reconstructing 3D objects into editable programs is pivotal for applications like reverse engineering and shape editing. However, existing methods often rely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets, restricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To address these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that reconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python scripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs capable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we construct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each object is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a multimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into executable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior performance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates intuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code modifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these contributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for programmatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding. The project homepage is available at \href{this https URL}{this link}."
2508.14892,"Reconstructing 3D human bodies from sparse views has been an appealing topic, which is crucial to broader the related applications. In this paper, we propose a quite challenging but valuable task to reconstruct the human body from only two images, i.e., the front and back view, which can largely lower the barrier for users to create their own 3D digital humans. The main challenges lie in the difficulty of building 3D consistency and recovering missing information from the highly sparse input. We redesign a geometry reconstruction model based on foundation reconstruction models to predict consistent point clouds even input images have scarce overlaps with extensive human data training. Furthermore, an enhancement algorithm is applied to supplement the missing color information, and then the complete human point clouds with colors can be obtained, which are directly transformed into 3D Gaussians for better rendering quality. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct the entire human in 190 ms on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, with two images at a resolution of 1024x1024, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the THuman2.0 and cross-domain datasets. Additionally, our method can complete human reconstruction even with images captured by low-cost mobile devices, reducing the requirements for data collection. Demos and code are available atthis https URL."
2508.1493,"Mixed Reality scene relighting, where virtual changes to lighting conditions realistically interact with physical objects, producing authentic illumination and shadows, can be used in a variety of applications. One such application in real estate could be visualizing a room at different times of day and placing virtual light fixtures. Existing deep learning-based relighting techniques typically exceed the real-time performance capabilities of current MR devices. On the other hand, scene understanding methods, such as on-device scene reconstruction, often yield inaccurate results due to scanning limitations, in turn affecting relighting quality. Finally, simpler 2D image filter-based approaches cannot represent complex geometry and shadows. We introduce a novel method to integrate image segmentation, with lighting propagation via anisotropic diffusion on top of basic scene understanding, and the computational simplicity of filter-based techniques. Our approach corrects on-device scanning inaccuracies, delivering visually appealing and accurate relighting effects in real-time on edge devices, achieving speeds as high as 100 fps. We show a direct comparison between our method and the industry standard, and present a practical demonstration of our method in the aforementioned real estate example."
2508.14933,"We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect 1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age. We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based text-to-image generative models."
2508.16024,"We investigate the use of wavelet-space feature decomposition in neural super-resolution for rendering pipelines. Building on recent neural upscaling frameworks, we introduce a formulation that predicts stationary wavelet coefficients rather than directly regressing RGB values. This frequency-aware decomposition separates low- and high-frequency components, enabling sharper texture recovery and reducing blur in challenging regions. Unlike conventional wavelet transforms, our use of the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) preserves spatial alignment across subbands, allowing the network to integrate G-buffer attributes and temporally warped history frames in a shift-invariant manner. The predicted coefficients are recombined through inverse wavelet synthesis, producing resolution-consistent reconstructions across arbitrary scale factors. We conduct extensive evaluations and ablations, showing that incorporating SWT improves both fidelity and perceptual quality with only modest overhead, while remaining compatible with standard rendering architectures. Taken together, our results suggest that wavelet-domain neural super-resolution provides a principled and efficient path toward higher-quality real-time rendering, with broader implications for neural rendering and graphics applications."

2508.16535,"Creating immersive 3D visual experiences typically requires expensive and specialized hardware such as VR headsets, autostereoscopic displays, or active shutter glasses. These constraints limit the accessibility and everyday use of 3D visualization technologies in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose a low-cost system that enables real-time 3D light-field viewing using only a standard 2D monitor, a conventional RGB webcam, and red-cyan anaglyph glasses. The system integrates real-time eye-tracking to dynamically adapt the displayed light-field image to the user's head position with a lightweight rendering pipeline that selects and composites stereoscopic views from pre-captured light-field data. The resulting anaglyph image is updated in real-time, creating a more immersive and responsive 3D experience. The system operates entirely on CPU and maintains a stable frame rate of 30 FPS, confirming its feasibility on typical consumer-grade hardware. All of these highlight the potential of our approach as an accessible platform for interactive 3D applications in education, digital media, and beyond."
2508.16696,"This paper introduces a system for generating interior design layouts based on user inputs, such as room type, style, and furniture preferences. CLIP extracts relevant furniture from a dataset, and a layout that contains furniture and a prompt are fed to Stable Diffusion with ControlNet to generate a design that incorporates the selected furniture. The design is then evaluated by classifiers to ensure alignment with the user's inputs, offering an automated solution for realistic interior design."
2508.16911,"We introduce Multimodal DuetDance (MDD), a diverse multimodal benchmark dataset designed for text-controlled and music-conditioned 3D duet dance motion generation. Our dataset comprises 620 minutes of high-quality motion capture data performed by professional dancers, synchronized with music, and detailed with over 10K fine-grained natural language descriptions. The annotations capture a rich movement vocabulary, detailing spatial relationships, body movements, and rhythm, making MDD the first dataset to seamlessly integrate human motions, music, and text for duet dance generation. We introduce two novel tasks supported by our dataset: (1) Text-to-Duet, where given music and a textual prompt, both the leader and follower dance motion are generated (2) Text-to-Dance Accompaniment, where given music, textual prompt, and the leader's motion, the follower's motion is generated in a cohesive, text-aligned manner. We include baseline evaluations on both tasks to support future research."
2508.17011,"Accurate 3D geometry acquisition is essential for a wide range of applications, such as computer graphics, autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, raw point clouds acquired in real-world environments are often corrupted with noise due to various factors such as sensor, lighting, material, environment etc, which reduces geometric fidelity and degrades downstream performance. Point cloud denoising is a fundamental problem, aiming to recover clean point sets while preserving underlying structures. Classical optimization-based methods, guided by hand-crafted filters or geometric priors, have been extensively studied but struggle to handle diverse and complex noise patterns. Recent deep learning approaches leverage neural network architectures to learn distinctive representations and demonstrate strong outcomes, particularly on complex and large-scale point clouds. Provided these significant advances, this survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of deep learning-based point cloud denoising methods up to August 2025. We organize the literature from two perspectives: (1) supervision level (supervised vs. unsupervised), and (2) modeling perspective, proposing a functional taxonomy that unifies diverse approaches by their denoising principles. We further analyze architectural trends both structurally and chronologically, establish a unified benchmark with consistent training settings, and evaluate methods in terms of denoising quality, surface fidelity, point distribution, and computational efficiency. Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field."
2508.17342,"Generating coherent and diverse human dances from music signals has gained tremendous progress in animating virtual avatars. While existing methods support direct dance synthesis, they fail to recognize that enabling users to edit dance movements is far more practical in real-world choreography scenarios. Moreover, the lack of high-quality dance datasets incorporating iterative editing also limits addressing this challenge. To achieve this goal, we first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset comprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In addition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance generation coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor. Considering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable iterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a prediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions. At the initial prediction stage, our framework improves the authority of generated results by directly modeling dance movements from tailored, aligned music. Moreover, at the subsequent iterative editing stages, we incorporate text descriptions as conditioning information to draw the editable results through a specifically designed Cross-modality Editing Module (CEM). Specifically, CEM adaptively integrates the initial prediction with music and text prompts as temporal motion cues to guide the synthesized sequences. Thereby, the results display music harmonics while preserving fine-grained semantic alignment with text descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on our newly collected DanceRemix dataset. Code is available atthis https URL."
2508.1748,"Holographic near-eye displays offer ultra-compact form factors for virtual and augmented reality systems, but rely on advanced computer-generated holography (CGH) algorithms to convert 3D scenes into interference patterns that can be displayed on spatial light modulators (SLMs). Gaussian Wave Splatting (GWS) has recently emerged as a powerful CGH paradigm that allows for the conversion of Gaussians, a state-of-the-art neural 3D representation, into holograms. However, GWS assumes smooth-phase distributions over the Gaussian primitives, limiting their ability to model view-dependent effects and reconstruct accurate defocus blur, and severely under-utilizing the space-bandwidth product of the SLM. In this work, we propose random-phase GWS (GWS-RP) to improve bandwidth utilization, which has the effect of increasing eyebox size, reconstructing accurate defocus blur and parallax, and supporting time-multiplexed rendering to suppress speckle artifacts.At the core of GWS-RP are (1) a fundamentally new wavefront compositing procedure and (2) an alpha-blending scheme specifically designed for random-phase Gaussian primitives, ensuring physically correct color reconstruction and robust occlusion handling. Additionally, we present the first formally derived algorithm for applying random phase to Gaussian primitives, grounded in rigorous statistical optics analysis and validated through practical near-eye display applications. Through extensive simulations and experimental validations, we demonstrate that these advancements, collectively with time-multiplexing, uniquely enables full-bandwith light field CGH that supports accurate accurate parallax and defocus, yielding state-of-the-art image quality and perceptually faithful 3D holograms for next-generation near-eye displays."
2508.1762,"Reference-based sketch colorization methods have garnered significant attention for the potential application in animation and digital illustration production. However, most existing methods are trained with image triplets of sketch, reference, and ground truth that are semantically and spatially similar, while real-world references and sketches often exhibit substantial misalignment. This mismatch in data distribution between training and inference leads to overfitting, consequently resulting in artifacts and signif- icant quality degradation in colorization results. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the reference representations, defined as the intermedium to transfer information from reference to sketch. Building on this analysis, we introduce a novel framework that leverages distinct reference representations to optimize different aspects of the colorization process. Our approach decomposes colorization into modular stages, al- lowing region-specific reference injection to enhance visual quality and reference similarity while mitigating spatial artifacts. Specifically, we first train a backbone network guided by high-level semantic embeddings. We then introduce a background encoder and a style encoder, trained in separate stages, to enhance low-level feature transfer and improve reference similar- ity. This design also enables flexible inference modes suited for a variety of use cases. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, together with a user study, demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to existing approaches. Code and pre-trained weight will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance."
2508.17645,"The emergence of 3D artificial intelligence-generated content (3D-AIGC) has enabled rapid synthesis of intricate geometries. However, a fundamental disconnect persists between AI-generated content and human-centric design paradigms, rooted in representational incompatibilities: conventional AI frameworks predominantly manipulate meshes or neural representations (\emph{e.g.}, NeRF, Gaussian Splatting), while designers operate within parametric modeling tools. This disconnection diminishes the practical value of AI for 3D industry, undermining the efficiency of human-AI collaboration. To resolve this disparity, we focus on generating design operation sequences, which are structured modeling histories that comprehensively capture the step-by-step construction process of 3D assets and align with designers' typical workflows in modern 3D software. We first reformulate fundamental modeling operations (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Extrude}, \emph{Boolean}) into differentiable units, enabling joint optimization of continuous (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Extrude} height) and discrete (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Boolean} type) parameters via gradient-based learning. Based on these differentiable operations, a hierarchical graph with gating mechanism is constructed and optimized end-to-end by minimizing Chamfer Distance to target geometries. Multi-stage sequence length constraint and domain rule penalties enable unsupervised learning of compact design sequences without ground-truth sequence supervision. Extensive validation demonstrates that the generated operation sequences achieve high geometric fidelity, smooth mesh wiring, rational step composition and flexible editing capacity, with full compatibility within design industry."
2508.17811,"Surface reconstruction has been widely studied in computer vision and graphics. However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover accurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address this issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface reconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage 2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric priors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction. Specifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view pixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images and thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve the accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted Chamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping areas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the orientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal estimator. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed improvement, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks.

2508.18525,"Training a generative model on a single human skeletal motion sequence without being bound to a specific kinematic tree has drawn significant attention from the animation community. Unlike text-to-motion generation, single-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of existing motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive retraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a controllable framework for blending two or more motions within a single generative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion blending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning the generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization mechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven control over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic skeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner."
2508.1854,"Radiance fields have revolutionized photo-realistic 3D scene visualization by enabling high-fidelity reconstruction of complex environments, making them an ideal match for light field displays. However, integrating these technologies presents significant computational challenges, as light field displays require multiple high-resolution renderings from slightly shifted viewpoints, while radiance fields rely on computationally intensive volume rendering. In this paper, we propose a unified and efficient framework for real-time radiance field rendering on light field displays. Our method supports a wide range of radiance field representations, including NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and Sparse Voxels, within a shared architecture based on a single-pass plane sweeping strategy and caching of shared, non-directional components. The framework generalizes across different scene formats without retraining, and avoids redundant computation across views. We further demonstrate a real-time interactive application on a Looking Glass display, achieving 200+ FPS at 512p across 45 views, enabling seamless, immersive 3D interaction. On standard benchmarks, our method achieves up to 22x speedup compared to independently rendering each view, while preserving image quality."
2508.18597,"We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent, realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods."
2508.18944,"Achieving realistic hair strand synthesis is essential for creating lifelike digital humans, but producing high-fidelity hair strand geometry remains a significant challenge. Existing methods require a complex setup for data acquisition, involving multi-view images captured in constrained studio environments. Additionally, these methods have longer hair volume estimation and strand synthesis times, which hinder efficiency. We introduce PanoHair, a model that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis. Our approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D orientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our method is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space manipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to infer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a streamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given the latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region in under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our experiments."
2508.1914,"Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis. However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g., close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight image quality improvements."
2509.0004,"This paper introduces a novel curve-based slicing method for generating planar layers with dynamically varying orientations in digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. Our approach effectively addresses key challenges in DLP printing, such as regions with large overhangs and staircase artifacts, while preserving its intrinsic advantages of high resolution and fast printing speeds. We formulate the slicing problem as an optimization task, in which parametric curves are computed to define both the slicing layers and the model partitioning through their tangent planes. These curves inherently define motion trajectories for the build platform and can be optimized to meet critical manufacturing objectives, including collision-free motion and floating-free deposition. We validate our method through physical experiments on a robotic multi-axis DLP printing setup, demonstrating that the optimized curves can robustly guide smooth, high-quality fabrication of complex geometries."
2509.00052,"Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications. Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions. Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves inference speed while preserving video quality."
2509.0018,"Curve-based representations, particularly integral curves, are often used to represent large-scale computational fluid dynamic simulations. Processing and analyzing curve-based vector field data sets often involves searching for neighboring segments given a query point or curve segment. However, because the original flow behavior may not be fully represented by the set of integral curves and the input integral curves may not be evenly distributed in space, popular neighbor search strategies often return skewed and redundant neighboring segments. Yet, there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive research on how different configurations of neighboring segments returned by specific neighbor search strategies affect subsequent tasks. To fill this gap, this study evaluates the performance of two popular neighbor search strategies combined with different distance metrics on a point-based vector field reconstruction task and a segment saliency estimation using input integral curves. A large number of reconstruction tests and saliency calculations are conducted for the study. To characterize the configurations of neighboring segments for an effective comparison of different search strategies, a number of measures, like average neighbor distance and uniformity, are proposed. Our study leads to a few observations that partially confirm our expectations about the ideal configurations of a neighborhood while revealing additional findings that were overlooked by the community."
2509.00269,"Despite the recent success of multi-view diffusion models for text/image-based 3D asset generation, instruction-based editing of 3D assets lacks surprisingly far behind the quality of generation models. The main reason is that recent approaches using 2D priors suffer from view-inconsistent editing signals. Going beyond 2D prior distillation methods and multi-view editing strategies, we propose a training-free editing method that operates within the latent space of a native 3D diffusion model, allowing us to directly manipulate 3D geometry. We guide the edit synthesis by blending 3D attention maps from the generation with the source object. Coupled with geometry-aware regularization guidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement step for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods enabling high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across a wide range of shapes and semantic manipulations."
2509.00406,"We present a high-performance system for automatic differentiation (AD) of functions defined on triangle meshes that exploits the inherent sparsity and locality of mesh-based energy functions to achieve fast gradient and Hessian computation on the GPU. Our system is designed around per-element forward-mode differentiation, enabling all local computations to remain in GPU registers or shared memory. Unlike reverse-mode approaches that construct and traverse global computation graphs, our method performs differentiation on the fly, minimizing memory traffic and avoiding global synchronization. Our programming model allows users to define local energy terms while the system handles parallel evaluation, derivative computation, and sparse Hessian assembly. We benchmark our system on a range of applications--cloth simulation, surface parameterization, mesh smoothing, and spherical manifold optimization. We achieve a geometric mean speedup of 6.2x over optimized PyTorch implementations for second-order derivatives, and 2.76x speedup for Hessian-vector products. For first-order derivatives, our system is 6.38x, 2.89x, and 1.98x faster than Warp, JAX, andthis http URL, respectively, while remaining on par with hand-written derivatives."
2509.00541,"Diffusion-based Image Editing has achieved significant success in recent years. However, it remains challenging to achieve high-quality image editing while maintaining the background similarity without sacrificing speed or memory efficiency. In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion framework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference latent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source features in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating target content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables fine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal model modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight, plug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based architectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that our proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and editability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps. Additionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural function evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate variables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency."
2509.00777,"Estimating albedo (a.k.a., intrinsic image decomposition) from single RGB images captured in real-world environments (e.g., the MVImgNet dataset) presents a significant challenge due to the absence of paired images and their ground truth albedos. Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything) have achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they remain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g., Objaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the large domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal generalization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing IntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the above-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition. Specifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by fine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual pseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence threshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative preference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This strategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality outputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for sub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become more accurate. To implement this, we propose a novel two-phase pipeline that sequentially applies these pseudo-labeling techniques to effectively adapt IntrinsicAnything to the real domain. Experimental results show that our IntrinsicReal significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results for albedo estimation on both synthetic and real-world datasets."
2509.01134,"Generative models for high-quality materials are particularly desirable to make 3D content authoring more accessible. However, the majority of material generation methods are trained on synthetic data. Synthetic data provides precise supervision for material maps, which is convenient but also tends to create a significant visual gap with real-world materials. Alternatively, recent work used a small dataset of real flash photographs to guarantee realism, however such data is limited in scale and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that leverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of realistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune a pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged in $2 \times 2$ grids. This way, our model inherits some realism of SDXL while learning the data distribution of the synthetic material grids. Still, this creates a realism gap, with some generated materials appearing synthetic. We propose to further finetune our model through reinforcement learning (RL), encouraging the generation of realistic materials. We develop a realism reward function for any material image under natural lighting, by collecting a large-scale dataset of realistic material images. We show that this approach increases generated materials' realism compared to our base model and related work."

2509.01839,"Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations, e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$, $\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition operations or complex preprocessing operations."
2509.02141,"3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) enable controllable facial geometry and expression editing for reconstruction, animation, and AR/VR, but traditional PCA-based mesh models are limited in resolution, detail, and photorealism. Neural volumetric methods improve realism but remain too slow for interactive use. Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast, high-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for expression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry, expressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head Gaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry and appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency details such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM provides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters (e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals that capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's capacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders represent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised images for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering. To learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first dataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust disentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across monocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression transfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression accuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance."
2509.02278,"Singing-driven 3D head animation is a challenging yet promising task with applications in virtual avatars, entertainment, and education. Unlike speech, singing involves richer emotional nuance, dynamic prosody, and lyric-based semantics, requiring the synthesis of fine-grained, temporally coherent facial motion. Existing speech-driven approaches often produce oversimplified, emotionally flat, and semantically inconsistent results, which are insufficient for singing animation. To address this, we propose Think2Sing, a diffusion-based framework that leverages pretrained large language models to generate semantically coherent and temporally consistent 3D head animations, conditioned on both lyrics and acoustics. A key innovation is the introduction of motion subtitles, an auxiliary semantic representation derived through a novel Singing Chain-of-Thought reasoning process combined with acoustic-guided retrieval. These subtitles contain precise timestamps and region-specific motion descriptions, serving as interpretable motion priors. We frame the task as a motion intensity prediction problem, enabling finer control over facial regions and improving the modeling of expressive motion. To support this, we create a multimodal singing dataset with synchronized video, acoustic descriptors, and motion subtitles, enabling diverse and expressive motion learning. Extensive experiments show that Think2Sing outperforms state-of-the-art methods in realism, expressiveness, and emotional fidelity, while also offering flexible, user-controllable animation editing."
2509.02474,"Following rapid advancements in text and image generation, research has increasingly shifted towards 3D generation. Unlike the well-established pixel-based representation in images, 3D representations remain diverse and fragmented, encompassing a wide variety of approaches such as voxel grids, neural radiance fields, signed distance functions, point clouds, or octrees, each offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this work, we present a unified evaluation framework designed to assess the performance of 3D representations in reconstruction and generation. We compare these representations based on multiple criteria: quality, computational efficiency, and generalization performance. Beyond standard model benchmarking, our experiments aim to derive best practices over all steps involved in the 3D generation pipeline, including preprocessing, mesh reconstruction, compression with autoencoders, and generation. Our findings highlight that reconstruction errors significantly impact overall performance, underscoring the need to evaluate generation and reconstruction jointly. We provide insights that can inform the selection of suitable 3D models for various applications, facilitating the development of more robust and application-specific solutions in 3D generation. The code for our framework is available atthis https URL."
2509.0368,"Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global (non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input. Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations."
2509.03753,"This paper evaluates several improvements to the memory layout of convex hulls to improve computation times for support point queries. The support point query is a fundamental part of common collision algorithms, and the work presented achieves a significant speedup depending on the number of vertices of the convex hull."
2509.03775,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians. However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed 3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models, directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge. ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively), while retraining close to state-of-art quality."
2509.04047,"Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach, approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters, but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations. Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous scattering in a feed-forward manner."
2509.04058,"Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics, especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control, limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than ``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i) human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion. Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized motion generation."
2509.04145,"Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars. However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand, generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time, controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale, cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods."
2509.04277,"An elastic rod is a long and thin body able to sustain large global deformations, even if local strains are small. The Cosserat rod is a non-linear elastic rod with an oriented centreline, which enables modelling of bending, stretching and twisting deformations. It can be used for physically-based computer simulation of threads, wires, ropes, as well as flexible surgical instruments such as catheters, guidewires or sutures. We present a massively-parallel implementation of the original CoRdE model as well as our inextensible variation. By superseding the CUDA Scalable Programming Model and using inter-block synchronization, we managed to simulate multiple physics time-steps per single kernel launch utilizing all the GPU's streaming multiprocessors. Under some constraints, this results in nearly constant computation time, regardless of the number of Cosserat elements simulated. When executing 10 time-steps per single kernel launch, our implementation of the original, extensible CoRdE was x40.0 faster. In a number of tests, the GPU implementation of our inextensible CoRdE modification achieved an average speed-up of x15.11 over the corresponding CPU version. Simulating a catheter/guidewire pair (2x512 Cosserat elements) in a cardiovascular application resulted in a 13.5 fold performance boost, enabling for accurate real-time simulation at haptic interactive rates (0.5-1kHz)."
2509.04481,"Recent advances in large language models(LLMs) enable compelling story generation, but connecting narrative text to playable visual environments remains an open challenge in procedural content generation(PCG). We present a lightweight pipeline that transforms short narrative prompts into a sequence of 2D tile-based game scenes, reflecting the temporal structure of stories. Given an LLM-generated narrative, our system identifies three key time frames, extracts spatial predicates in the form of ""Object-Relation-Object"" triples, and retrieves visual assets using affordance-aware semantic embeddings from the GameTileNet dataset. A layered terrain is generated using Cellular Automata, and objects are placed using spatial rules grounded in the predicate structure. We evaluated our system in ten diverse stories, analyzing tile-object matching, affordance-layer alignment, and spatial constraint satisfaction across frames. This prototype offers a scalable approach to narrative-driven scene generation and lays the foundation for future work on multi-frame continuity, symbolic tracking, and multi-agent coordination in story-centered PCG."
2509.04513,"Ptychographic phase retrieval enables high-resolution imaging of complex samples but often suffers from artifacts such as grid pathology and multislice crosstalk, which degrade reconstructed images. We propose a plug-and-play (PnP) framework that integrates physics model-based phase retrieval with text-guided image editing using foundational diffusion models. By employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), our approach ensures consensus between data fidelity and artifact removal subproblems, maintaining physics consistency while enhancing image quality. Artifact removal is achieved using a text-guided diffusion image editing method (LEDITS++) with a pre-trained foundational diffusion model, allowing users to specify artifacts for removal in natural language. Demonstrations on simulated and experimental datasets show significant improvements in artifact suppression and structural fidelity, validated by metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and diffraction pattern consistency. This work highlights the combination of text-guided generative models and model-based phase retrieval algorithms as a transferable and fidelity-preserving method for high-quality diffraction imaging."
2509.05285,"Recent advances in text-driven 3D scene editing and stylization, which leverage the powerful capabilities of 2D generative models, have demonstrated promising outcomes. However, challenges remain in ensuring high-quality stylization and view consistency simultaneously. Moreover, applying style consistently to different regions or objects in the scene with semantic correspondence is a challenging task. To address these limitations, we introduce techniques that enhance the quality of 3D stylization while maintaining view consistency and providing optional region-controlled style transfer. Our method achieves stylization by re-training an initial 3D representation using stylized multi-view 2D images of the source views. Therefore, ensuring both style consistency and view consistency of stylized multi-view images is crucial. We achieve this by extending the style-aligned depth-conditioned view generation framework, replacing the fully shared attention mechanism with a single reference-based attention-sharing mechanism, which effectively aligns style across different viewpoints. Additionally, inspired by recent 3D inpainting methods, we utilize a grid of multiple depth maps as a single-image reference to further strengthen view consistency among stylized images. Finally, we propose Multi-Region Importance-Weighted Sliced Wasserstein Distance Loss, allowing styles to be applied to distinct image regions using segmentation masks from off-the-shelf models. We demonstrate that this optional feature enhances the faithfulness of style transfer and enables the mixing of different styles across distinct regions of the scene. Experimental evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative, demonstrate that our pipeline effectively improves the results of text-driven 3D stylization."
2509.05595,"Reducing the triangle count in complex 3D models is a basic geometry preprocessing step in graphics pipelines such as efficient rendering and interactive editing. However, most existing mesh simplification methods exhibit a few issues. Firstly, they often lead to self-intersections during decimation, a major issue for applications such as 3D printing and soft-body simulation. Second, to perform simplification on a mesh in the wild, one would first need to perform re-meshing, which often suffers from surface shifts and losses of sharp features. Finally, existing re-meshing and simplification methods can take minutes when processing large-scale meshes, limiting their applications in practice. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel GPU-based mesh optimization approach containing three key components: (1) a parallel re-meshing algorithm to turn meshes in the wild into watertight, manifold, and intersection-free ones, and reduce the prevalence of poorly shaped triangles; (2) a robust parallel simplification algorithm with intersection-free guarantees; (3) an optimization-based safe projection algorithm to realign the simplified mesh with the input, eliminating the surface shift introduced by re-meshing and recovering the original sharp features. The algorithm demonstrates remarkable efficiency, simplifying a 2-million-face mesh to 20k triangles in 3 seconds on RTX4090. We evaluated the approach on the Thingi10K dataset and showcased its exceptional performance in geometry preservation and speed."
2509.05855,"Each element in tensioned structural networks -- such as tensegrity, architectural fabrics, or medical braces/meshes -- requires a specific tension level to achieve and maintain the desired shape, stability, and compliance. These structures are challenging to manufacture, 3D print, or assemble because flattening the network during fabrication introduces multiplicative inaccuracies in the network's final tension gradients. This study overcomes this challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of such networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the spinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and prescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts the network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex locations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into arcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into printable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D networks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v) automatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening process. The proposed method is experimentally validated using 2D unit cells of viscoelastic filaments, where accurate tension gradients are achieved with an average element strain error of less than 1.0\%. The method remains effective for networks with element minimum length and maximum stress of 5.8 mm and 7.3 MPa, respectively. The method is used to demonstrate the fabrication of three complex cases: a flat spiderweb, a curved mesh, and a tensegrity system. The programmable tension gradient algorithm can be utilized to produce compact, integrated cable networks, enabling novel applications such as moment-exerting structures in medical braces and splints."
2509.06573,"Hand-drawn character animation is a vibrant field in computer graphics, presenting challenges in achieving geometric consistency while conveying expressive motion. Traditional skeletal animation methods maintain geometric consistency but struggle with complex non-rigid elements like flowing hair and skirts, leading to unnatural deformation. Conversely, video diffusion models synthesize realistic dynamics but often create geometric distortions in stylized drawings due to domain gaps. This work proposes a hybrid animation system that combines skeletal animation and video diffusion. Initially, coarse images are generated from characters retargeted with skeletal animations for geometric guidance. These images are then enhanced in texture and secondary dynamics using video diffusion priors, framing this enhancement as an inpainting task. A domain-adapted diffusion model refines user-masked regions needing improvement, especially for secondary dynamics. To enhance motion realism further, we introduce a Secondary Dynamics Injection (SDI) strategy in the denoising process, incorporating features from a pre-trained diffusion model enriched with human motion priors. Additionally, to tackle unnatural deformations from low-poly single-mesh character modeling, we present a Hair Layering Modeling (HLM) technique that uses segmentation maps to separate hair from the body, allowing for more natural animation of long-haired characters. Extensive experiments show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations."
2509.06607,"Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes we are able to ""upgrade"" existing human pose and shape datasets to include biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better constrained and more realistic model of human articulation.

2509.0695,"Large transformer-based models have made significant progress in generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, generating novel viewpoints without the need for test-time optimization. However, these models are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene datasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To overcome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion models, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic data offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data generation as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address this, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer architecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective learning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over standard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data. As a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs.

2509.07044,"With the evolution of new manufacturing technologies such as multi-material 3D printing, one can think of new type of objects that consist of considerably less, yet heterogeneous, material, consequently being porous, lighter and cheaper, while having the very same functionality as the original object when manufactured from one single solid material. We aim at questioning five decades of traditional paradigms in geometric CAD and focus at new generation of CAD objects that are not solid, but contain heterogeneous free-form internal microstructures. We propose a unified manufacturing pipeline that involves all stages, namely design, optimization, manufacturing, and inspection of microstructured free-form geometries.

2509.07127,"Generated Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images demand evaluation criteria tuned to their symbolic and vectorial nature: criteria that existing metrics such as FID, LPIPS, or CLIPScore fail to satisfy. In this paper, we introduce SVGauge, the first human-aligned, reference based metric for text-to-SVG generation. SVGauge jointly measures (i) visual fidelity, obtained by extracting SigLIP image embeddings and refining them with PCA and whitening for domain alignment, and (ii) semantic consistency, captured by comparing BLIP-2-generated captions of the SVGs against the original prompts in the combined space of SBERT and TF-IDF. Evaluation on the proposed SHE benchmark shows that SVGauge attains the highest correlation with human judgments and reproduces system-level rankings of eight zero-shot LLM-based generators more faithfully than existing metrics. Our results highlight the necessity of vector-specific evaluation and provide a practical tool for benchmarking future text-to-SVG generation models."
2509.07175,"Since the Voronoi diagram appears in many applications, the topic of improving its computational efficiency remains attractive. We propose a novel yet efficient method to compute Voronoi diagrams bounded by a given domain, i.e., the clipped or restricted Voronoi diagrams. The intersection of the domain and a Voronoi cell (domain-cell intersection) is generated by removing the part outside the cell from the domain, which can be accomplished by several clippings. Different from the existing methods, we present an edge-based search scheme to find clipping planes (bisectors). A test called point-in-cell is first set up to tell whether a space point is in a target Voronoi cell or not. Then, for each edge of the intermediate domain-cell intersection, we will launch a clipping only if its two endpoints are respectively inside and outside the corresponding Voronoi cell, where the bisector for the clipping can be found by using a few times of point-in-cell tests. Therefore, our method only involves the clippings that contribute to the final results, which is a great advantage over the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, because each domain-cell intersection can be generated independently, we extend the proposed method to the GPUs for computing Voronoi diagrams in parallel. The experimental results show the best performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art ones, regardless of site distribution. This paper was first submitted to SIGGRAPH Asia 2025."
2509.07522,"Modeling of high-frequency outgoing radiance distributions has long been a key challenge in rendering, particularly for glossy material. Such distributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly sensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity methods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable limitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance distributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by reflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework, named neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered multi-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe, embedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding process through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only significantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection distributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of glossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our method reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions, allowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently produces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various glossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to baseline approaches."
2509.07653,"Volumetric video is emerging as a key medium for digitizing the dynamic physical world, creating the virtual environments with six degrees of freedom to deliver immersive user experiences. However, robustly modeling general dynamic scenes, especially those involving topological changes while maintaining long-term tracking remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we present TaoGS, a novel topology-aware dynamic Gaussian representation that disentangles motion and appearance to support, both, long-range tracking and topological adaptation. We represent scene motion with a sparse set of motion Gaussians, which are continuously updated by a spatio-temporal tracker and photometric cues that detect structural variations across frames. To capture fine-grained texture, each motion Gaussian anchors and dynamically activates a set of local appearance Gaussians, which are non-rigidly warped to the current frame to provide strong initialization and significantly reduce training time. This activation mechanism enables efficient modeling of detailed textures and maintains temporal coherence, allowing high-fidelity rendering even under challenging scenarios such as changing clothes. To enable seamless integration into codec-based volumetric formats, we introduce a global Gaussian Lookup Table that records the lifespan of each Gaussian and organizes attributes into a lifespan-aware 2D layout. This structure aligns naturally with standard video codecs and supports up to 40 compression. TaoGS provides a unified, adaptive solution for scalable volumetric video under topological variation, capturing moments where ""elegance in motion"" and ""Power in Stillness"", delivering immersive experiences that harmonize with the physical world."
2509.08643,"Generating 3D shapes at part level is pivotal for downstream applications such as mesh retopology, UV mapping, and 3D printing. However, existing part-based generation methods often lack sufficient controllability and suffer from poor semantically meaningful decomposition. To this end, we introduce X-Part, a controllable generative model designed to decompose a holistic 3D object into semantically meaningful and structurally coherent parts with high geometric fidelity. X-Part exploits the bounding box as prompts for the part generation and injects point-wise semantic features for meaningful decomposition. Furthermore, we design an editable pipeline for interactive part generation. Extensive experimental results show that X-Part achieves state-of-the-art performance in part-level shape generation. This work establishes a new paradigm for creating production-ready, editable, and structurally sound 3D assets. Codes will be released for public research."
2509.08855,"Harmonic decomposition of surfaces, such as spherical and spheroidal harmonics, is used to analyze morphology, reconstruct, and generate surface inclusions of particulate microstructures. However, obtaining high-quality meshes of engineering microstructures using these approaches remains an open question. In harmonic approaches, we usually reconstruct surfaces by evaluating the harmonic bases on equidistantly sampled simplicial complexes of the base domains (e.g., triangular spheroids and disks). However, this traditional sampling does not account for local changes in the Jacobian of the basis functions, resulting in nonuniform discretization after reconstruction or generation. As it impacts the accuracy and time step, high-quality discretization of microstructures is crucial for efficient numerical simulations (e.g., finite element and discrete element methods). To circumvent this issue, we propose an efficient hierarchical diffusion-based approach for resampling the surface-i.e., performing a reparameterization-to yield an equalized mesh triangulation. Analogous to heat problems, we use nonlinear diffusion to resample the curvilinear coordinates of the analysis domain, thereby enlarging small triangles at the expense of large triangles on surfaces. We tested isotropic and anisotropic diffusion schemes on the recent spheroidal and hemispheroidal harmonics methods. The results show a substantial improvement in the quality metrics for surface triangulation. Unlike traditional surface reconstruction and meshing techniques, this approach preserves surface morphology, along with the areas and volumes of surfaces. We discuss the results and the associated computational costs for large 2D and 3D microstructures, such as digital twins of concrete and stone masonry, and their future applications."
2509.08947,"Accurate measurement of images produced by electronic displays is critical for the evaluation of both traditional and computational displays. Traditional display measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a model are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer sufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and photometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined with a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to be visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a combination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference predictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and visual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion, homography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function as precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual Difference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli under different viewing conditions for the human visual system. We validate the proposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel detection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Our uncertainty analysis framework enables the estimation of the theoretical upper bound for defect pixel detection performance and provides confidence intervals for VDP quality scores."
2509.09952,"Material creation and reconstruction are crucial for appearance modeling but traditionally require significant time and expertise from artists. While recent methods leverage visual foundation models to synthesize PBR materials from user-provided inputs, they often fall short in quality, flexibility, and user control. We propose a novel two-stage generate-and-estimate framework for PBR material generation. In the generation stage, a fine-tuned diffusion model synthesizes shaded, tileable texture images aligned with user input. In the estimation stage, we introduce a chained decomposition scheme that sequentially predicts SVBRDF channels by passing previously extracted representation as input into a single-step image-conditional diffusion model. Our method is efficient, high quality, and enables flexible user control. We evaluate our approach against existing material generation and estimation methods, demonstrating superior performance. Our material estimation method shows strong robustness on both generated textures and in-the-wild photographs. Furthermore, we highlight the flexibility of our framework across diverse applications, including text-to-material, image-to-material, structure-guided generation, and material editing."
2509.10599,"This paper presents a method for computing interleaved additive and subtractive manufacturing operations to fabricate models of arbitrary shapes. We solve the manufacturing planning problem by searching a sequence of inverse operations that progressively transform a target model into a null shape. Each inverse operation corresponds to either an additive or a subtractive step, ensuring both manufacturability and structural stability of intermediate shapes throughout the process. We theoretically prove that any model can be fabricated exactly using a sequence generated by our approach. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we adopt a voxel-based implementation and develop a scalable algorithm that works on models represented by a large number of voxels. Our approach has been tested across a range of digital models and further validated through physical fabrication on a hybrid manufacturing system with automatic tool switching."
2509.10678,"We present T2Bs, a framework for generating high-quality, animatable character head morphable models from text by combining static text-to-3D generation with video diffusion. Text-to-3D models produce detailed static geometry but lack motion synthesis, while video diffusion models generate motion with temporal and multi-view geometric inconsistencies. T2Bs bridges this gap by leveraging deformable 3D Gaussian splatting to align static 3D assets with video outputs. By constraining motion with static geometry and employing a view-dependent deformation MLP, T2Bs (i) outperforms existing 4D generation methods in accuracy and expressiveness while reducing video artifacts and view inconsistencies, and (ii) reconstructs smooth, coherent, fully registered 3D geometries designed to scale for building morphable models with diverse, realistic facial motions. This enables synthesizing expressive, animatable character heads that surpass current 4D generation techniques."
2509.11003,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown impressive results in real-time novel view synthesis. However, it often struggles under sparse-view settings, producing undesirable artifacts such as floaters, inaccurate geometry, and overfitting due to limited observations. We find that a key contributing factor is uncontrolled densification, where adding Gaussian primitives rapidly without guidance can harm geometry and cause artifacts. We propose AD-GS, a novel alternating densification framework that interleaves high and low densification phases. During high densification, the model densifies aggressively, followed by photometric loss based training to capture fine-grained scene details. Low densification then primarily involves aggressive opacity pruning of Gaussians followed by regularizing their geometry through pseudo-view consistency and edge-aware depth smoothness. This alternating approach helps reduce overfitting by carefully controlling model capacity growth while progressively refining the scene representation. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that AD-GS significantly improves rendering quality and geometric consistency compared to existing methods.

2509.11087,"Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) reconstruction requires recovering both the spatial distribution of acoustic scatterers and their direction-dependent response. Time-domain backprojection is the most common 3D SAS reconstruction algorithm, but it does not model directionality and can suffer from sampling limitations, aliasing, and occlusion. Prior neural volumetric methods applied to synthetic aperture sonar treat each voxel as an isotropic scattering density, not modeling anisotropic returns. We introduce SH-SAS, an implicit neural representation that expresses the complex acoustic scattering field as a set of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients. A multi-resolution hash encoder feeds a lightweight MLP that outputs complex SH coefficients up to a specified degree L. The zeroth-order coefficient acts as an isotropic scattering field, which also serves as the density term, while higher orders compactly capture directional scattering with minimal parameter overhead. Because the model predicts the complex amplitude for any transmit-receive baseline, training is performed directly from 1-D time-of-flight signals without the need to beamform intermediate images for supervision. Across synthetic and real SAS (both in-air and underwater) benchmarks, results show that SH-SAS performs better in terms of 3D reconstruction quality and geometric metrics than previous methods."
2509.11377,"3D Gaussians are currently being heavily investigated for their scene modeling and compression abilities. In 3D volumes, their use is being explored for representing dense volumes as sparsely as possible. However, most of these methods begin with a memory inefficient data format. Specially in Scientific Visualization(SciVis), where most popular formats are dense-grid data structures that store every grid cell, irrespective of its contribution. OpenVDB library and data format were introduced for representing sparse volumetric data specifically for visual effects use cases such as clouds, fire, fluids etc. It avoids storing empty cells by masking them during storage. It presents an opportunity for use in SciVis, specifically as a modeling framework for conversion to 3D Gaussian particles for further compression and for a unified modeling approach for different scientific volume types. This compression head-start is non-trivial and this paper would like to present this with a rendering algorithm based on line integration implemented in OptiX8.1 for calculating 3D Gaussians contribution along a ray for optical-depth accumulation. For comparing the rendering results of our ray marching Gaussians renderer, we also implement a SciVis style primary-ray only NanoVDB HDDA based ray marcher for OpenVDB voxel grids. Finally, this paper also explores application of this Gaussian model to formats of volumes other than regular grids, such as AMR volumes and point clouds, using internal representation of OpenVDB grid class types for data hierarchy and subdivision structure."

It fuses two categories of lenses (3D and Decal) to become a versatile lens for seamlessly working on multiple geometric representations that commonly coexist in 3D visualizations. In addition, we incorporate our lens into virtual reality as it enables a natural style of direct spatial manipulation for exploratory 3D data analysis. To demonstrate its potential use, we discuss two domain examples in which our lens technique creates customized visualizations of both surfaces and streamlines."
2509.13306,"The procedural occupancy function is a flexible and compact representation for creating 3D scenes. For rasterization and other tasks, it is often necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large. Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost. The code and the supplementary video for this paper are available atthis https URL."
2509.13688,"Controllable, high-fidelity mesh editing remains a significant challenge in 3D content creation. Existing generative methods often struggle with complex geometries and fail to produce detailed results. We propose CraftMesh, a novel framework for high-fidelity generative mesh manipulation via Poisson Seamless Fusion. Our key insight is to decompose mesh editing into a pipeline that leverages the strengths of 2D and 3D generative models: we edit a 2D reference image, then generate a region-specific 3D mesh, and seamlessly fuse it into the original model. We introduce two core techniques: Poisson Geometric Fusion, which utilizes a hybrid SDF/Mesh representation with normal blending to achieve harmonious geometric integration, and Poisson Texture Harmonization for visually consistent texture blending. Experimental results demonstrate that CraftMesh outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior global consistency and local detail in complex editing tasks."
2509.13779,"Acquiring bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) is essential for simulating light transport and analytically modeling material properties. Over the past two decades, numerous intensity-only BRDF datasets in the visible spectrum have been introduced, primarily for RGB image rendering applications. However, in scientific and engineering domains, there remains an unmet need to model light transport with polarization--a fundamental wave property of light--across hyperspectral bands. To address this gap, we present the first hyperspectral-polarimetric BRDF (hpBRDF) dataset of real-world materials, spanning wavelengths from 414 to 950\,nm and densely sampled at 68 spectral bands. This dataset covers both the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectra, enabling detailed material analysis and light reflection simulations that incorporate polarization at each narrow spectral band. We develop an efficient hpBRDF acquisition system that captures high-dimensional hpBRDFs within a feasible acquisition time. Using this system, we demonstrate hyperspectral-polarimetric rendering using the acquired hpBRDFs. To provide insights on hpBRDF, we analyze the hpBRDFs with respect to their dependencies on wavelength, polarization state, material type, and illumination/viewing geometry. Also, we propose compact representations through principal component analysis and implicit neural hpBRDF modeling."
2509.13938,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized radiance field reconstruction by achieving high-quality novel view synthesis with fast rendering speed, introducing 3D Gaussian primitives to represent the scene. However, 3DGS encounters blurring and floaters when applied to complex scenes, caused by the reconstruction of redundant and ambiguous geometric structures. We attribute this issue to the unstable optimization of the Gaussians. To address this limitation, we present a plug-and-play PDE-based optimization method that overcomes the optimization constraints of 3DGS-based approaches in various tasks, such as novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction. Firstly, we theoretically derive that the 3DGS optimization procedure can be modeled as a PDE, and introduce a viscous term to ensure stable optimization. Secondly, we use the Material Point Method (MPM) to obtain a stable numerical solution of the PDE, which enhances both global and local constraints. Additionally, an effective Gaussian densification strategy and particle constraints are introduced to ensure fine-grained details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering and reconstruction quality."
2509.14177,"We extend the progressive dynamics model (Zhang et al., 2024) from cloth and shell simulation to volumetric finite elements, enabling an efficient level-of-detail (LOD) animation-design pipeline with predictive coarse-resolution previews facilitating rapid iterative design for a final, to-be-generated, high-resolution animation of volumetric elastodynamics. This extension to volumetric domains poses significant new challenges, including the construction of suitable mesh hierarchies and the definition of effective prolongation operators for codimension-0 progressive dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a practical method for defining multiresolution hierarchies and, more importantly, introduce a simple yet effective topology-aware algorithm for constructing prolongation operators between overlapping (but not necessarily conforming) volumetric meshes. Our key insight is a boundary binding strategy that enables the computation of barycentric coordinates, allowing several off-the-shelf interpolants -- such as standard barycentric coordinates, Biharmonic Coordinates (Wang et al., 2015), and Phong Deformation (James, 2020) -- to serve as ""plug-and-play"" components for prolongation with minimal modification. We show that our progressive volumetric simulation framework achieves high-fidelity matching LOD animation across resolutions including challenging dynamics with high speeds, large deformations, and frictional contact."
2509.1513,"Recent video diffusion models show immense potential for spatial intelligence tasks due to their rich world priors, but this is undermined by limited controllability, poor spatial-temporal consistency, and entangled scene-camera dynamics. Existing solutions, such as model fine-tuning and warping-based repainting, struggle with scalability, generalization, and robustness against artifacts. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free, inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. 1) Intra-Step Recursive Refinement injects fine-grained trajectory guidance at denoising steps through a recursive correction loop, ensuring motion remains aligned with the target path. 2) Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels. 3) Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and photorealistic content generation. Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, enabling broad applicability across various 3D/4D tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in trajectory adherence, geometric consistency, and perceptual quality, outperforming both training-intensive and inference-only baselines."
2509.15236,"We present ChannelFlow-Tools, a configuration-driven framework that standardizes the end-to-end path from programmatic CAD solid generation to ML-ready inputs and targets for 3D obstructed channel flows. The toolchain integrates geometry synthesis with feasibility checks, signed distance field (SDF) voxelization, automated solver orchestration on HPC (waLBerla LBM), and Cartesian resampling to co-registered multi-resolution tensors. A single Hydra/OmegaConf configuration governs all stages, enabling deterministic reproduction and controlled ablations. As a case study, we generate 10k+ scenes spanning Re=100-15000 with diverse shapes and poses. An end-to-end evaluation of storage trade-offs directly from the emitted artifacts, a minimal 3D U-Net at 128x32x32, and example surrogate models with dataset size illustrate that the standardized representations support reproducible ML training. ChannelFlow-Tools turns one-off dataset creation into a reproducible, configurable pipeline for CFD surrogate modeling."
2509.15246,"CAD programs, structured as parametric sequences of commands that compile into precise 3D geometries, are fundamental to accurate and efficient engineering design processes. Generating these programs from nonparametric data such as point clouds and meshes remains a crucial yet challenging task, typically requiring extensive manual intervention. Current deep generative models aimed at automating CAD generation are significantly limited by imbalanced and insufficiently large datasets, particularly those lacking representation for complex CAD programs. To address this, we introduce GenCAD-3D, a multimodal generative framework utilizing contrastive learning for aligning latent embeddings between CAD and geometric encoders, combined with latent diffusion models for CAD sequence generation and retrieval. Additionally, we present SynthBal, a synthetic data augmentation strategy specifically designed to balance and expand datasets, notably enhancing representation of complex CAD geometries. Our experiments show that SynthBal significantly boosts reconstruction accuracy, reduces the generation of invalid CAD models, and markedly improves performance on high-complexity geometries, surpassing existing benchmarks. These advancements hold substantial implications for streamlining reverse engineering and enhancing automation in engineering design. We will publicly release our datasets and code, including a set of 51 3D-printed and laser-scanned parts on our project site."
2509.15249,"Existing 3D scene generation methods often struggle to model the complex logical dependencies and physical constraints between objects, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and realistic environments. We propose CausalStruct, a novel framework that embeds causal reasoning into 3D scene generation. Utilizing large language models (LLMs), We construct causal graphs where nodes represent objects and attributes, while edges encode causal dependencies and physical constraints. CausalStruct iteratively refines the scene layout by enforcing causal order to determine the placement order of objects and applies causal intervention to adjust the spatial configuration according to physics-driven constraints, ensuring consistency with textual descriptions and real-world dynamics. The refined scene causal graph informs subsequent optimization steps, employing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative(PID) controller to iteratively tune object scales and positions. Our method uses text or images to guide object placement and layout in 3D scenes, with 3D Gaussian Splatting and Score Distillation Sampling improving shape accuracy and rendering stability. Extensive experiments show that CausalStruct generates 3D scenes with enhanced logical coherence, realistic spatial interactions, and robust adaptability."
2509.15538,"Control variates are a variance-reduction technique for Monte Carlo integration. The principle involves approximating the integrand by a function that can be analytically integrated, and integrating using the Monte Carlo method only the residual difference between the integrand and the approximation, to obtain an unbiased estimate. Neural networks are universal approximators that could potentially be used as a control variate. However, the challenge lies in the analytic integration, which is not possible in general. In this manuscript, we study one of the simplest neural network models, the multilayered perceptron (MLP) with continuous piecewise linear activation functions, and its possible analytic integration. We propose an integration method based on integration domain subdivision, employing techniques from computational geometry to solve this problem in 2D. We demonstrate that an MLP can be used as a control variate in combination with our integration method, showing applications in the light transport simulation."
2509.15562,"This paper introduces open-source contributions designed to accelerate research in volumetric multi-material additive manufacturing and metamaterial design. We present a flexible Python-based API facilitating parametric expression of multi-material gradients, integration with external libraries, multi-material lattice structure design, and interoperability with finite element modeling. Novel implicit multi-material modeling techniques enable detailed spatial grading at multiple scales within lattice structures. Additionally, our framework integrates with finite element analysis, offering predictive simulations via adaptive mesh sizing and direct import of simulation results to guide material distributions. Practical case studies illustrate the utility of these contributions, including functionally graded lattices, algorithmically generated structures, and simulation-informed designs, exemplified by a multi-material bicycle seat optimized for mechanical performance and rider comfort.

2509.15691,"It is well-known that a $d$-dimensional polynomial Bézier curve of degree $n$ can be subdivided into two segments using the famous de Casteljau algorithm in $O(dn^2)$ time. Can this problem be solved more efficiently? In this paper, we show that it is possible to do this in $O(dn\log{n})$ time using the fast Fourier transform and its inverse. Experiments show that the direct application of the new method performs well only for small values of $n$, as the algorithm is numerically unstable. However, a slightly modified version -- which still has $O(dn\log{n})$ computational complexity -- offers good numerical quality, which is confirmed by numerical experiments conducted in \textsf{Python}. Moreover, the new method has a nice property: if a Bézier curve is extended by an additional control point, the subdivision can be updated in $O(d)$ time.A similar idea can be applied to speed up the subdivision of rational Bézier curves and rectangular Bézier surfaces, as well as to compute the derivatives of Bézier curves more efficiently."
2509.15892,"Dynamic scene reconstruction from multi-view videos remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. While recent neural surface reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable results in static 3D reconstruction, extending these approaches with comparable quality for dynamic scenes introduces significant computational and representational challenges. Existing dynamic methods focus on novel-view synthesis, therefore, their extracted meshes tend to be noisy. Even approaches aiming for geometric fidelity often result in too smooth meshes due to the ill-posedness of the problem. We present a novel framework for highly detailed dynamic reconstruction that extends the static 3D reconstruction method NeuralAngelo to work in dynamic settings. To that end, we start with a high-quality template scene reconstruction from the initial frame using NeuralAngelo, and then jointly optimize deformation fields that track the template and refine it based on the temporal sequence. This flexible template allows updating the geometry to include changes that cannot be modeled with the deformation field, for instance occluded parts or the changes in the topology. We show superior reconstruction accuracy in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods on the ActorsHQ dataset."
2509.16064,"We focus on the problem of using generative diffusion models for the task of motion detailing: converting a rough version of a character animation, represented by a sparse set of coarsely posed, and imprecisely timed blocking poses, into a detailed, natural looking character animation. Current diffusion models can address the problem of correcting the timing of imprecisely timed poses, but we find that no good solution exists for leveraging the diffusion prior to enhance a sparse set of blocking poses with additional pose detail. We overcome this challenge using a simple inference-time trick. At certain diffusion steps, we blend the outputs of an unconditioned diffusion model with input blocking pose constraints using per-blocking-pose tolerance weights, and pass this result in as the input condition to an pre-existing motion retiming model. We find this approach works significantly better than existing approaches that attempt to add detail by blending model outputs or via expressing blocking pose constraints as guidance. The result is the first diffusion model that can robustly convert blocking-level poses into plausible detailed character animations."
2509.16336,"Learning editable high-resolution scene representations for dynamic scenes is an open problem with applications across the domains from autonomous driving to creative editing - the most successful approaches today make a trade-off between editability and supporting scene complexity: neural atlases represent dynamic scenes as two deforming image layers, foreground and background, which are editable in 2D, but break down when multiple objects occlude and interact. In contrast, scene graph models make use of annotated data such as masks and bounding boxes from autonomous-driving datasets to capture complex 3D spatial relationships, but their implicit volumetric node representations are challenging to edit view-consistently. We propose Neural Atlas Graphs (NAGs), a hybrid high-resolution scene representation, where every graph node is a view-dependent neural atlas, facilitating both 2D appearance editing and 3D ordering and positioning of scene elements. Fit at test-time, NAGs achieve state-of-the-art quantitative results on the Waymo Open Dataset - by 5 dB PSNR increase compared to existing methods - and make environmental editing possible in high resolution and visual quality - creating counterfactual driving scenarios with new backgrounds and edited vehicle appearance. We find that the method also generalizes beyond driving scenes and compares favorably - by more than 7 dB in PSNR - to recent matting and video editing baselines on the DAVIS video dataset with a diverse set of human and animal-centric scenes.Project Page:this https URL"
2509.16735,"Recent studies in neuroscience highlight the significant potential of brain connectivity networks, which are commonly constructed from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for brain disorder diagnosis. Traditional brain connectivity networks are typically obtained using predefined methods that incorporate manually-set thresholds to estimate inter-regional relationships. However, such approaches often introduce redundant connections or overlook essential interactions, compromising the value of the constructed networks. Besides, the insufficiency of labeled data further increases the difficulty of learning generalized representations of intrinsic brain characteristics. To mitigate those issues, we propose a self-supervised framework to learn an optimal structure and representation for brain connectivity networks, focusing on individualized generation and optimization in an unsupervised manner. We firstly employ two existing whole-brain connectomes to adaptively construct their complementary brain network structure learner, and then introduce a multi-state graph-based encoder with a joint iterative learning strategy to simultaneously optimize both the generated network structure and its representation. By leveraging self-supervised pretraining on large-scale unlabeled brain connectivity data, our framework enables the brain connectivity network learner to generalize e ffectively to unseen disorders, while requiring only minimal finetuning of the encoder for adaptation to new diagnostic tasks. Extensive experiments on cross-dataset brain disorder diagnosis demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, validating its effectiveness and generalizability.

2509.16869,"Low Dynamic Range (LDR) to High Dynamic Range (HDR) image translation is a fundamental task in many computational vision problems. Numerous data-driven methods have been proposed to address this problem; however, they lack explicit modeling of illumination, lighting, and scene geometry in images. This limits the quality of the reconstructed HDR images. Since lighting and shadows interact differently with different materials, (e.g., specular surfaces such as glass and metal, and lambertian or diffuse surfaces such as wood and stone), modeling material-specific properties (e.g., specular and diffuse reflectance) has the potential to improve the quality of HDR image reconstruction. This paper presents PhysHDR, a simple yet powerful latent diffusion-based generative model for HDR image reconstruction. The denoising process is conditioned on lighting and depth information and guided by a novel loss to incorporate material properties of surfaces in the scene. The experimental results establish the efficacy of PhysHDR in comparison to a number of recent state-of-the-art methods."
2509.1696,"3D digital garment generation and editing play a pivotal role in fashion design, virtual try-on, and gaming. Traditional methods struggle to meet the growing demand due to technical complexity and high resource costs. Learning-based approaches offer faster, more diverse garment synthesis based on specific requirements and reduce human efforts and time costs. However, they still face challenges such as inconsistent multi-view geometry or textures and heavy reliance on detailed garment topology and manual rigging. We propose SemanticGarment, a 3D Gaussian-based method that realizes high-fidelity 3D garment generation from text or image prompts and supports semantic-based interactive editing for flexible user customization. To ensure multi-view consistency and garment fitting, we propose to leverage structural human priors for the generative model by introducing a 3D semantic clothing model, which initializes the geometry structure and lays the groundwork for view-consistent garment generation and editing. Without the need to regenerate or rely on existing mesh templates, our approach allows for rapid and diverse modifications to existing Gaussians, either globally or within a local region. To address the artifacts caused by self-occlusion for garment reconstruction based on single image, we develop a self-occlusion optimization strategy to mitigate holes and artifacts that arise when directly animating self-occluded garments. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate our superior performance in 3D garment generation and editing."
2509.17168,"Head and gaze dynamics are crucial in expressive 3D facial animation for conveying emotion and intention. However, existing methods frequently address facial components in isolation, overlooking the intricate coordination between gaze, head motion, and speech. The scarcity of high-quality gaze-annotated datasets hinders the development of data-driven models capable of capturing realistic, personalized gaze control. To address these challenges, we propose StyGazeTalk, an audio-driven method that generates synchronized gaze and head motion styles. We extract speaker-specific motion traits from gaze-head sequences with a multi-layer LSTM structure incorporating a style encoder, enabling the generation of diverse animation styles. We also introduce a high-precision multimodal dataset comprising eye-tracked gaze, audio, head pose, and 3D facial parameters, providing a valuable resource for training and evaluating head and gaze control models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates realistic, temporally coherent, and style-aware head-gaze motions, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in audio-driven facial animation."
2509.17212,"Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) are a natural implicit representation for open surfaces but, unlike Signed Distance Fields (SDFs), are challenging to triangulate into explicit meshes. This is especially true at high resolutions where neural UDFs exhibit higher noise levels, which makes it hard to capture fine details. Most current techniques perform within single voxels without reference to their neighborhood, resulting in missing surface and holes where the UDF is ambiguous or noisy. We show that this can be remedied by performing several passes and by reasoning on previously extracted surface elements to incorporate neighborhood information. Our key contribution is an iterative neural network that does this and progressively improves surface recovery within each voxel by spatially propagating information from increasingly distant neighbors. Unlike single-pass methods, our approach integrates newly detected surfaces, distance values, and gradients across multiple iterations, effectively correcting errors and stabilizing extraction in challenging regions. Experiments on diverse 3D models demonstrate that our method produces significantly more accurate and complete meshes than existing approaches, particularly for complex geometries, enabling UDF surface extraction at higher resolutions where traditional methods fail."
2509.17748,"Creating human digital doubles is becoming easier and much more accessible to everyone using consumer grade devices. In this work, we investigate how avatar style (realistic vs cartoon) and avatar familiarity (self, acquaintance, unknown person) affect self/other-identification, perceived realism, affinity and social presence with a controlled offline experiment. We created two styles of avatars (realistic-looking MetaHumans and cartoon-looking ReadyPlayerMe avatars) and facial animations stimuli for them using performance capture. Questionnaire responses demonstrate that higher appearance realism leads to a higher level of identification, perceived realism and social presence. However, avatars with familiar faces, especially those with high appearance realism, lead to a lower level of identification, perceived realism, and affinity. Although participants identified their digital doubles as their own, they consistently did not like their avatars, especially of realistic appearance. But they were less critical and more forgiving about their acquaintance's or an unknown person's digital double."

Investigating the perception of these virtual humans can help guide to develop better and more effective applications. Recent developments show that the appearance of the virtual humans reached to a very realistic level. However, there is not yet adequate analysis on the perception of appearance and animation realism for emotionally expressive virtual humans. In this paper, we designed a user experiment and analyzed the effect of a realistic virtual human's appearance realism and animation realism in varying emotion conditions. We found that higher appearance realism and higher animation realism leads to higher social presence and higher attractiveness ratings. We also found significant effects of animation realism on perceived realism and emotion intensity levels. Our study sheds light into how appearance and animation realism effects the perception of highly realistic virtual humans in emotionally expressive scenarios and points out to future directions."
2509.17974,"Feature tracking in time-varying scalar fields is a fundamental task in scientific computing. Topological descriptors, which summarize important features of data, have proved to be viable tools to facilitate this task. The merge tree is a topological descriptor that captures the connectivity behaviors of the sub- or superlevel sets of a scalar field. Edit distances between merge trees play a vital role in effective temporal data tracking. Existing methods to compute them fall into two main classes, namely whether they are dependent or independent of the branch decomposition. These two classes represent the most prominent approaches for producing tracking results. In this paper, we compare four different merge tree edit distance-based methods for feature tracking. We demonstrate that these methods yield distinct results with both analytical and real-world data sets. Furthermore, we investigate how these results vary and identify the factors that influence them. Our experiments reveal significant differences in tracked features over time, even among those produced by techniques within the same category."
2509.17979,"Wireless sensing literature has long aspired to achieve X-ray-like vision at radio frequencies. Yet, state-of-the-art wireless sensing literature has yet to generate the archetypal X-ray image: one of the bones beneath flesh. In this paper, we explore MCT, a penetration-based RF-imaging system for imaging bones at mm-resolution, one that significantly exceeds prior penetration-based RF imaging literature. Indeed the long wavelength, significant attenuation and complex diffraction that occur as RF propagates through flesh, have long limited imaging resolution (to several centimeters at best). We address these concerns through a novel penetration-based synthetic aperture algorithm, coupled with a learning-based pipeline to correct for diffraction-induced artifacts. A detailed evaluation of meat models demonstrates a resolution improvement from sub-decimeter to sub-centimeter over prior art in RF penetrative imaging."
2509.17985,"In this paper, we propose VideoFrom3D, a novel framework for synthesizing high-quality 3D scene videos from coarse geometry, a camera trajectory, and a reference image. Our approach streamlines the 3D graphic design workflow, enabling flexible design exploration and rapid production of deliverables. A straightforward approach to synthesizing a video from coarse geometry might condition a video diffusion model on geometric structure. However, existing video diffusion models struggle to generate high-fidelity results for complex scenes due to the difficulty of jointly modeling visual quality, motion, and temporal consistency. To address this, we propose a generative framework that leverages the complementary strengths of image and video diffusion models. Specifically, our framework consists of a Sparse Anchor-view Generation (SAG) and a Geometry-guided Generative Inbetweening (GGI) module. The SAG module generates high-quality, cross-view consistent anchor views using an image diffusion model, aided by Sparse Appearance-guided Sampling. Building on these anchor views, GGI module faithfully interpolates intermediate frames using a video diffusion model, enhanced by flow-based camera control and structural guidance. Notably, both modules operate without any paired dataset of 3D scene models and natural images, which is extremely difficult to obtain. Comprehensive experiments show that our method produces high-quality, style-consistent scene videos under diverse and challenging scenarios, outperforming simple and extended baselines."
2509.18461,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have dramatically advanced deepfake technology, and its threats to digital security, media integrity, and public trust have increased rapidly. This research explored zero-shot deepfake detection, an emerging method even when the models have never seen a particular deepfake variation. In this work, we studied self-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifier, generative model fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques that better adapt to the ever-evolving deepfake threat. In addition, we suggested AI-driven prevention strategies that mitigated the underlying generation pipeline of the deepfakes before they occurred. They consisted of adversarial perturbations for creating deepfake generators, digital watermarking for content authenticity verification, real-time AI monitoring for content creation pipelines, and blockchain-based content verification frameworks. Despite these advancements, zero-shot detection and prevention faced critical challenges such as adversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks. These limitations were addressed by discussing future research directions on explainable AI for deepfake detection, multimodal fusion based on image, audio, and text analysis, quantum AI for enhanced security, and federated learning for privacy-preserving deepfake detection. This further highlighted the need for an integrated defense framework for digital authenticity that utilized zero-shot learning in combination with preventive deepfake mechanisms. Finally, we highlighted the important role of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers, cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to create resilient defenses against the rising tide of deepfake attacks."
2509.18497,"Radiance fields have gained tremendous success with applications ranging from novel view synthesis to geometry reconstruction, especially with the advent of Gaussian splatting. However, they sacrifice modeling of material reflective properties and lighting conditions, leading to significant geometric ambiguities and the inability to easily perform relighting. One way to address these limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been prohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner loop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that make the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less accurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build an efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the classic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space of spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend the classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives, propose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the backward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than auto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering where light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling hundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent reflections using a spherical harmonics representation. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate superior geometry reconstruction, view synthesis and relighting than previous inverse rendering baselines, or data-driven baselines given relatively sparse datasets with known or unknown lighting conditions."
2509.18831,"Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image and video synthesis. In addition, several concept control methods have been proposed to enable fine-grained, continuous, and flexible control over free-form text prompts. However, these methods not only require intensive training time and GPU memory usage to learn the sliders or embeddings but also need to be retrained for different diffusion backbones, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce Text Slider, a lightweight, efficient and plug-and-play framework that identifies low-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder, enabling continuous control of visual concepts while significantly reducing training time, GPU memory consumption, and the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, Text Slider supports multi-concept composition and continuous control, enabling fine-grained and flexible manipulation in both image and video synthesis. We show that Text Slider enables smooth and continuous modulation of specific attributes while preserving the original spatial layout and structure of the input. Text Slider achieves significantly better efficiency: 5$\times$ faster training than Concept Slider and 47$\times$ faster than Attribute Control, while reducing GPU memory usage by nearly 2$\times$ and 4$\times$, respectively."
2509.18948,"Diffusion models have significantly advanced image manipulation techniques, and their ability to generate photorealistic images is beginning to transform retail workflows, particularly in presale visualization. Beyond artistic style transfer, the capability to perform fine-grained visual feature transfer is becoming increasingly important. Embroidery is a textile art form characterized by intricate interplay of diverse stitch patterns and material properties, which poses unique challenges for existing style transfer methods. To explore the customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content features with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of image analogy. We first construct an image pair to define the target style, and then adopt a similarity metric based on the decoupled representations of pretrained diffusion models for style-content separation. Subsequently, we propose a two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation technique to capture fine-grained style features. In the first stage, we iteratively update the whole LoRA and the selected style blocks to initially separate style from content. In the second stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to further decouple style and content through self-knowledge distillation. Finally, we build an inference pipeline to handle image or text inputs with only the style blocks. To evaluate our method on fine-grained style transfer, we build a benchmark for embroidery customization. Our approach surpasses prior methods on this task and further demonstrates strong generalization to three additional domains: artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and appearance transfer."
2509.19412,"This paper focuses on automatic music engraving, i.e., the creation of a humanly-readable musical score from musical content. This step is fundamental for all applications that include a human player, but it remains a mostly unexplored topic in symbolic music processing. In this work, we formalize the problem as a collection of interdependent subtasks, and propose a unified graph neural network (GNN) framework that targets the case of piano music and quantized symbolic input. Our method employs a multi-task GNN to jointly predict voice connections, staff assignments, pitch spelling, key signature, stem direction, octave shifts, and clef signs. A dedicated postprocessing pipeline generates print-ready MusicXML/MEI outputs. Comprehensive evaluation on two diverse piano corpora (J-Pop and DCML Romantic) demonstrates that our unified model achieves good accuracy across all subtasks, compared to existing systems that only specialize in specific subtasks. These results indicate that a shared GNN encoder with lightweight task-specific decoders in a multi-task setting offers a scalable and effective solution for automatic music engraving."
2509.19939,"Existing human mesh recovery methods assume a standard human body structure, overlooking diverse anatomical conditions such as limb loss. This assumption introduces bias when applied to individuals with amputations - a limitation further exacerbated by the scarcity of suitable datasets. To address this gap, we propose Amputated Joint Aware 3D Human Mesh Recovery (AJAHR), which is an adaptive pose estimation framework that improves mesh reconstruction for individuals with limb loss. Our model integrates a body-part amputation classifier, jointly trained with the mesh recovery network, to detect potential amputations. We also introduce Amputee 3D (A3D), which is a synthetic dataset offering a wide range of amputee poses for robust training. While maintaining competitive performance on non-amputees, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for amputated individuals. Additional materials can be found at the project webpage."
2509.19995,"Scaling artist-designed meshes to high triangle numbers remains challenging for autoregressive generative models. Existing transformer-based methods suffer from long-sequence bottlenecks and limited quantization resolution, primarily due to the large number of tokens required and constrained quantization granularity. These issues prevent faithful reproduction of fine geometric details and structured density patterns. We introduce MeshMosaic, a novel local-to-global framework for artist mesh generation that scales to over 100K triangles--substantially surpassing prior methods, which typically handle only around 8K faces. MeshMosaic first segments shapes into patches, generating each patch autoregressively and leveraging shared boundary conditions to promote coherence, symmetry, and seamless connectivity between neighboring regions. This strategy enhances scalability to high-resolution meshes by quantizing patches individually, resulting in more symmetrical and organized mesh density and structure. Extensive experiments across multiple public datasets demonstrate that MeshMosaic significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometric fidelity and user preference, supporting superior detail representation and practical mesh generation for real-world applications."
2509.20128,"Audio-driven facial animation has made significant progress in multimedia applications, with diffusion models showing strong potential for talking-face synthesis. However, most existing works treat speech features as a monolithic representation and fail to capture their fine-grained roles in driving different facial motions, while also overlooking the importance of modeling keyframes with intense dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KSDiff, a Keyframe-Augmented Speech-Aware Dual-Path Diffusion framework. Specifically, the raw audio and transcript are processed by a Dual-Path Speech Encoder (DPSE) to disentangle expression-related and head-pose-related features, while an autoregressive Keyframe Establishment Learning (KEL) module predicts the most salient motion frames. These components are integrated into a Dual-path Motion generator to synthesize coherent and realistic facial motions. Extensive experiments on HDTF and VoxCeleb demonstrate that KSDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements in both lip synchronization accuracy and head-pose naturalness. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining speech disentanglement with keyframe-aware diffusion for talking-head generation."
2509.20198,"Large-scale terrain scans are the basis for many important tasks, such as topographic mapping, forestry, agriculture, and infrastructure planning. The resulting point cloud data sets are so massive in size that even basic tasks like viewing take hours to days of pre-processing in order to create level-of-detail structures that allow inspecting the data set in their entirety in real time. In this paper, we propose a method that is capable of instantly visualizing massive country-sized scans with hundreds of billions of points. Upon opening the data set, we first load a sparse subsample of points and initialize an overview of the entire point cloud, immediately followed by a surface reconstruction process to generate higher-quality, hole-free heightmaps. As users start navigating towards a region of interest, we continue to prioritize the heightmap construction process to the user's viewpoint. Once a user zooms in closely, we load the full-resolution point cloud data for that region and update the corresponding height map textures with the full-resolution data. As users navigate elsewhere, full-resolution point data that is no longer needed is unloaded, but the updated heightmap textures are retained as a form of medium level of detail. Overall, our method constitutes a form of direct out-of-core rendering for massive point cloud data sets (terabytes, compressed) that requires no preprocessing and no additional disk space.

2509.204,"This paper presents SeHDR, a novel high dynamic range 3D Gaussian Splatting (HDR-3DGS) approach for generating HDR novel views given multi-view LDR images. Unlike existing methods that typically require the multi-view LDR input images to be captured from different exposures, which are tedious to capture and more likely to suffer from errors (e.g., object motion blurs and calibration/alignment inaccuracies), our approach learns the HDR scene representation from multi-view LDR images of a single exposure. Our key insight to this ill-posed problem is that by first estimating Bracketed 3D Gaussians (i.e., with different exposures) from single-exposure multi-view LDR images, we may then be able to merge these bracketed 3D Gaussians into an HDR scene representation. Specifically, SeHDR first learns base 3D Gaussians from single-exposure LDR inputs, where the spherical harmonics parameterize colors in a linear color space. We then estimate multiple 3D Gaussians with identical geometry but varying linear colors conditioned on exposure manipulations. Finally, we propose the Differentiable Neural Exposure Fusion (NeEF) to integrate the base and estimated 3D Gaussians into HDR Gaussians for novel view rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeHDR outperforms existing methods as well as carefully designed baselines."
2509.20414,"Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

2509.2071,"UV unwrapping is an essential task in computer graphics, enabling various visual editing operations in rendering pipelines. However, existing UV unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming, fragmentation, lack of semanticity, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use. An artist-style UV map must not only satisfy fundamental criteria, such as overlap-free mapping and minimal distortion, but also uphold higher-level standards, including clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and semantic coherence. We introduce ArtUV, a fully automated, end-to-end method for generating artist-style UV unwrapping. We simulates the professional UV mapping process by dividing it into two stages: surface seam prediction and artist-style UV parameterization. In the seam prediction stage, SeamGPT is used to generate semantically meaningful cutting seams. Then, in the parameterization stage, a rough UV obtained from an optimization-based method, along with the mesh, is fed into an Auto-Encoder, which refines it into an artist-style UV map. Our method ensures semantic consistency and preserves topological structure, making the UV map ready for 2D editing. We evaluate ArtUV across multiple benchmarks and show that it serves as a versatile solution, functioning seamlessly as either a plug-in for professional rendering tools or as a standalone system for rapid, high-quality UV generation."
2509.20725,"Mesh seams play a pivotal role in partitioning 3D surfaces for UV parametrization and texture mapping. Poorly placed seams often result in severe UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, thereby hindering texture synthesis and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods frequently trade one failure mode for another-producing either high distortion or many scattered islands. To address this, we introduce SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam generator conditioned on point cloud inputs. SeamCrafter employs a dual-branch point-cloud encoder that disentangles and captures complementary topological and geometric cues during pretraining. To further enhance seam quality, we fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference dataset derived from a novel seam-evaluation framework. This framework assesses seams primarily by UV distortion and fragmentation, and provides pairwise preference labels to guide optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency and visual fidelity."
2509.20824,"Directly generating 3D meshes, the default representation for 3D shapes in the graphics industry, using auto-regressive (AR) models has become popular these days, thanks to their sharpness, compactness in the generated results, and ability to represent various types of surfaces. However, AR mesh generative models typically construct meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which does not effectively capture the underlying geometry in a manner consistent with human perception. Inspired by 2D models that progressively refine images, such as the prevailing next-scale prediction AR models, we propose generating meshes auto-regressively in a progressive coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, we view mesh simplification algorithms, which gradually merge mesh faces to build simpler meshes, as a natural fine-to-coarse process. Therefore, we generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR model to approximate the reverse process of simplification in the order of level of detail, constructing meshes initially from a single point and gradually adding geometric details through local remeshing, where the topology is not predefined and is alterable. Our experiments show that this novel progressive mesh generation approach not only provides intuitive control over generation quality and time consumption by early stopping the auto-regressive process but also enables applications such as mesh refinement and editing."
2509.20858,"Architecture embodies aesthetic, cultural, and historical values, standing as a tangible testament to human civilization. Researchers have long leveraged virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR) to enable immersive exploration and interpretation of architecture, enhancing accessibility, public understanding, and creative workflows around architecture in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practice. However, existing VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on hard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across diverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal architectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable data-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA annotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of approximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a multi-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia Commons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel coarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural images. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose an LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate reliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated images and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis annotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to provide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We perform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone ,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT."
2509.21007,"Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing. Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages, making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling, leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while maintaining competitive speed."
2509.21114,"We present CHARM, a novel parametric representation and generative framework for anime hairstyle modeling. While traditional hair modeling methods focus on realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime hairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that challenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh modeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and unsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible control-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points represents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric parameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both artist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this representation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that effectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By interpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential ""hair language"", our autoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle topology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate both training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with separated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and generation quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime hairstyle modeling.

2509.21541,"Hair simulation and rendering are challenging due to complex strand dynamics, diverse material properties, and intricate light-hair interactions. Recent video diffusion models can generate high-quality videos, but they lack fine-grained control over hair dynamics. We present ControlHair, a hybrid framework that integrates a physics simulator with conditional video diffusion to enable controllable dynamic hair rendering. ControlHair adopts a three-stage pipeline: it first encodes physics parameters (e.g., hair stiffness, wind) into per-frame geometry using a simulator, then extracts per-frame control signals, and finally feeds control signals into a video diffusion model to generate videos with desired hair dynamics. This cascaded design decouples physics reasoning from video generation, supports diverse physics, and makes training the video diffusion model easy. Trained on a curated 10K video dataset, ControlHair outperforms text- and pose-conditioned baselines, delivering precisely controlled hair dynamics. We further demonstrate three use cases of ControlHair: dynamic hairstyle try-on, bullet-time effects, and cinemagraphic. ControlHair introduces the first physics-informed video diffusion framework for controllable dynamics. We provide a teaser video and experimental results on our website."
2509.21702,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) combines classic image-based rendering, pointbased graphics, and modern differentiable techniques, and offers an interesting alternative to traditional physically-based rendering. 3DGS-family models are far from efficient for power-constrained Extended Reality (XR) devices, which need to operate at a Watt-level. This paper introduces PowerGS, the first framework to jointly minimize the rendering and display power in 3DGS under a quality constraint. We present a general problem formulation and show that solving the problem amounts to 1) identifying the iso-quality curve(s) in the landscape subtended by the display and rendering power and 2) identifying the power-minimal point on a given curve, which has a closed-form solution given a proper parameterization of the curves. PowerGS also readily supports foveated rendering for further power savings. Extensive experiments and user studies show that PowerGS achieves up to 86% total power reduction compared to state-of-the-art 3DGS models, with minimal loss in both subjective and objective quality.

2509.22222,"Reconstructing object deformation from a single image remains a significant challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods typically rely on multi-view video to recover deformation, limiting their applicability under constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose DeformSplat, a novel framework that effectively guides 3D Gaussian deformation from only a single image. Our method introduces two main technical contributions. First, we present Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching which bridges the domain gap between 3D Gaussian representations and 2D pixel observations. This enables robust deformation guidance from sparse visual cues. Second, we propose Rigid Part Segmentation consisting of initialization and refinement. This segmentation explicitly identifies rigid regions, crucial for maintaining geometric coherence during deformation. By combining these two techniques, our approach can reconstruct consistent deformations from a single image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods and naturally extends to various applications,such as frame interpolation and interactive object manipulation."
2509.22227,"Recent advances in image acquisition and scene reconstruction have enabled the generation of high-quality structural urban scene geometry, given sufficient site information. However, current capture techniques often overlook the crucial importance of texture quality, resulting in noticeable visual artifacts in the textured models. In this work, we introduce the urban geometry and texture co-capture problem under limited prior knowledge before a site visit. The only inputs are a 2D building contour map of the target area and a safe flying altitude above the buildings. We propose an innovative aerial path planning framework designed to co-capture images for reconstructing both structured geometry and high-fidelity textures. To evaluate and guide view planning, we introduce a comprehensive texture quality assessment system, including two novel metrics tailored for building facades. Firstly, our method generates high-quality vertical dipping views and horizontal planar views to effectively capture both geometric and textural details. A multi-objective optimization strategy is then proposed to jointly maximize texture fidelity, improve geometric accuracy, and minimize the cost associated with aerial views. Furthermore, we present a sequential path planning algorithm that accounts for texture consistency during image capture. Extensive experiments on large-scale synthetic and real-world urban datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively produces image sets suitable for concurrent geometric and texture reconstruction, enabling the creation of realistic, textured scene proxies at low operational cost."
2509.22442,"Learning a control policy for a multi-phase, long-horizon task, such as basketball maneuvers, remains challenging for reinforcement learning approaches due to the need for seamless policy composition and transitions between skills. A long-horizon task typically consists of distinct subtasks with well-defined goals, separated by transitional subtasks with unclear goals but critical to the success of the entire task. Existing methods like the mixture of experts and skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share significant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal states between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy integration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor skills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states. Based on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless and robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set of fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions. Policies trained by our approach can effectively control the simulated character to interact with the ball and accomplish the long-horizon task specified by real-time user commands, without relying on ball trajectory references."
2509.23336,"Simplified proxy models are commonly used to represent architectural structures, reducing storage requirements and enabling real-time rendering. However, the geometric simplifications inherent in proxies result in a loss of fine color and geometric details, making it essential for textures to compensate for the loss. Preserving the rich texture information from the original dense architectural reconstructions remains a daunting task, particularly when working with unordered RGB photographs. We propose an automated method for generating realistic texture maps for architectural proxy models at the texel level from an unordered collection of registered photographs. Our approach establishes correspondences between texels on a UV map and pixels in the input images, with each texel's color computed as a weighted blend of associated pixel values. Using differentiable rendering, we optimize blending parameters to ensure photometric and perspective consistency, while maintaining seamless texture coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse architectural models and varying photographic conditions, enabling the creation of high-quality textures that preserve visual fidelity and structural detail."
2509.23489,"We introduce a gaze-tracking--free method to reduce OLED display power consumption in VR with minimal perceptual impact. This technique exploits the time course of chromatic adaptation, the human visual system's ability to maintain stable color perception under changing illumination. To that end, we propose a novel psychophysical paradigm that models how human adaptation state changes with the scene illuminant. We exploit this model to compute an optimal illuminant shift trajectory, controlling the rate and extent of illumination change, to reduce display power under a given perceptual loss budget. Our technique significantly improves the perceptual quality over prior work that applies illumination shifts instantaneously. Our technique can also be combined with prior work on luminance dimming to reduce display power by 31% with no statistical loss of perceptual quality."
2509.23572,"We introduce a method that automatically and jointly updates both continuous and discrete parameters of a compound lens design, to improve its performance in terms of sharpness, speed, or both. Previous methods for compound lens design use gradient-based optimization to update continuous parameters (e.g., curvature of individual lens elements) of a given lens topology, requiring extensive expert intervention to realize topology changes. By contrast, our method can additionally optimize discrete parameters such as number and type (e.g., singlet or doublet) of lens elements. Our method achieves this capability by combining gradient-based optimization with a tailored Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm, using transdimensional mutation and paraxial projection operations for efficient global exploration. We show experimentally on a variety of lens design tasks that our method effectively explores an expanded design space of compound lenses, producing better designs than previous methods and pushing the envelope of speed-sharpness tradeoffs achievable by automated lens design."
2509.23607,"In the field of 3D content generation, single image scene reconstruction methods still struggle to simultaneously ensure the quality of individual assets and the coherence of the overall scene in complex environments, while texture editing techniques often fail to maintain both local continuity and multi-view consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel system ZeroScene, which leverages the prior knowledge of large vision models to accomplish both single image-to-3D scene reconstruction and texture editing in a zero-shot manner. ZeroScene extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information from input images to infer spatial relationships within the scene. It then jointly optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses of the point cloud to update object poses for precise scene alignment, ultimately constructing a coherent and complete 3D scene that encompasses both foreground and background. Moreover, ZeroScene supports texture editing of objects in the scene. By imposing constraints on the diffusion model and introducing a mask-guided progressive image generation strategy, we effectively maintain texture consistency across multiple viewpoints and further enhance the realism of rendered results through Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only ensures the geometric and appearance accuracy of generated assets, but also faithfully reconstructs scene layouts and produces highly detailed textures that closely align with text prompts."
2509.23703,"Point cloud completion is a vital task focused on reconstructing complete point clouds and addressing the incompleteness caused by occlusion and limited sensor resolution. Traditional methods relying on fixed local region partitioning, such as k-nearest neighbors, which fail to account for the highly uneven distribution of geometric complexity across different regions of a shape. This limitation leads to inefficient representation and suboptimal reconstruction, especially in areas with fine-grained details or structural discontinuities. This paper proposes a point cloud completion framework called Degree-Flexible Point Graph Completion Network (DFG-PCN). It adaptively assigns node degrees using a detail-aware metric that combines feature variation and curvature, focusing on structurally important regions. We further introduce a geometry-aware graph integration module that uses Manhattan distance for edge aggregation and detail-guided fusion of local and global features to enhance representation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches."
2509.23709,"In the field of 3D point cloud generation, numerous 3D generative models have demonstrated the ability to generate diverse and realistic 3D shapes. However, the majority of these approaches struggle to generate controllable 3D point cloud shapes that meet user-specific requirements, hindering the large-scale application of 3D point cloud generation. To address the challenge of lacking control in 3D point cloud generation, we are the first to propose controlling the generation of point clouds by shape structures that comprise part existences and part adjacency relationships. We manually annotate the adjacency relationships between the segmented parts of point cloud shapes, thereby constructing a StructureGraph representation. Based on this StructureGraph representation, we introduce StrucADT, a novel structure-controllable point cloud generation model, which consists of StructureGraphNet module to extract structure-aware latent features, cCNF Prior module to learn the distribution of the latent features controlled by the part adjacency, and Diffusion Transformer module conditioned on the latent features and part adjacency to generate structure-consistent point cloud shapes. Experimental results demonstrate that our structure-controllable 3D point cloud generation method produces high-quality and diverse point cloud shapes, enabling the generation of controllable point clouds based on user-specified shape structures and achieving state-of-the-art performance in controllable point cloud generation on the ShapeNet dataset."
2509.23718,"The task of 3D shape captioning occupies a significant place within the domain of computer graphics and has garnered considerable interest in recent years. Traditional approaches to this challenge frequently depend on the utilization of costly voxel representations or object detection techniques, yet often fail to deliver satisfactory outcomes. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we introduce Diff-3DCap, which employs a sequence of projected views to represent a 3D object and a continuous diffusion model to facilitate the captioning process. More precisely, our approach utilizes the continuous diffusion model to perturb the embedded captions during the forward phase by introducing Gaussian noise and then predicts the reconstructed annotation during the reverse phase. Embedded within the diffusion framework is a commitment to leveraging a visual embedding obtained from a pre-trained visual-language model, which naturally allows the embedding to serve as a guiding signal, eliminating the need for an additional classifier. Extensive results of our experiments indicate that Diff-3DCap can achieve performance comparable to that of the current state-of-the-art methods."
2509.23769,"Controlling illumination during video post-production is a crucial yet elusive goal in computational photography. Existing methods often lack flexibility, restricting users to certain relighting models. This paper introduces ReLumix, a novel framework that decouples the relighting algorithm from temporal synthesis, thereby enabling any image relighting technique to be seamlessly applied to video. Our approach reformulates video relighting into a simple yet effective two-stage process: (1) an artist relights a single reference frame using any preferred image-based technique (e.g., Diffusion Models, physics-based renderers); and (2) a fine-tuned stable video diffusion (SVD) model seamlessly propagates this target illumination throughout the sequence. To ensure temporal coherence and prevent artifacts, we introduce a gated cross-attention mechanism for smooth feature blending and a temporal bootstrapping strategy that harnesses SVD's powerful motion priors. Although trained on synthetic data, ReLumix shows competitive generalization to real-world videos. The method demonstrates significant improvements in visual fidelity, offering a scalable and versatile solution for dynamic lighting control."
2509.23852,"The accompanying actions and gestures in dialogue are often closely linked to interactions with the environment, such as looking toward the interlocutor or using gestures to point to the described target at appropriate moments. Speech and semantics guide the production of gestures by determining their timing (WHEN) and style (HOW), while the spatial locations of interactive objects dictate their directional execution (WHERE). Existing approaches either rely solely on descriptive language to generate motions or utilize audio to produce non-interactive gestures, thereby lacking the characterization of interactive timing and spatial intent. This significantly limits the applicability of conversational gesture generation, whether in robotics or in the fields of game and animation production. To address this gap, we present a full-stack solution. We first established a unique data collection method to simultaneously capture high-precision human motion and spatial intent. We then developed a generation model driven by audio, language, and spatial data, alongside dedicated metrics for evaluating interaction timing and spatial accuracy. Finally, we deployed the solution on a humanoid robot, enabling rich, context-aware physical interactions."
2509.2415,"Point clouds are widely used representations of 3D data, but determining the visibility of points from a given viewpoint remains a challenging problem due to their sparse nature and lack of explicit connectivity. Traditional methods, such as Hidden Point Removal (HPR), face limitations in computational efficiency, robustness to noise, and handling concave regions or low-density point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visibility determination in point clouds by formulating it as a binary classification task. The core of our network consists of a 3D U-Net that extracts view-independent point-wise features and a shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that predicts point visibility using the extracted features and view direction as inputs. The network is trained end-to-end with ground-truth visibility labels generated from rendered 3D models. Our method significantly outperforms HPR in both accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving up to 126 times speedup on large point clouds. Additionally, our network demonstrates robustness to noise and varying point cloud densities and generalizes well to unseen shapes. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on the ShapeNet, ABC Dataset and real-world datasets, showing substantial improvements in visibility accuracy. We also demonstrate the versatility of our method in various applications, including point cloud visualization, surface reconstruction, normal estimation, shadow rendering, and viewpoint optimization. Our code and models are available atthis https URL."
2509.24677,"Real-time visibility determination in expansive or dynamically changing environments has long posed a significant challenge in computer graphics. Existing techniques are computationally expensive and often applied as a precomputation step on a static scene. We present NeuralPVS, the first deep-learning approach for visibility computation that efficiently determines from-region visibility in a large scene, running at approximately 100 Hz processing with less than $1\%$ missing geometry. This approach is possible by using a neural network operating on a voxelized representation of the scene. The network's performance is achieved by combining sparse convolution with a 3D volume-preserving interleaving for data compression. Moreover, we introduce a novel repulsive visibility loss that can effectively guide the network to converge to the correct data distribution. This loss provides enhanced robustness and generalization to unseen scenes. Our results demonstrate that NeuralPVS outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-time visibility computation."
2509.24986,"In user-generated-content (UGC) applications, non-expert users often rely on image-to-3D generative models to create 3D assets. In this context, primitive-based shape abstraction offers a promising solution for UGC scenarios by compressing high-resolution meshes into compact, editable representations. Towards this end, effective shape abstraction must therefore be structure-aware, characterized by low overlap between primitives, part-aware alignment, and primitive compactness. We present Light-SQ, a novel superquadric-based optimization framework that explicitly emphasizes structure-awareness from three aspects. (a) We introduce SDF carving to iteratively udpate the target signed distance field, discouraging overlap between primitives. (b) We propose a block-regrow-fill strategy guided by structure-aware volumetric decomposition, enabling structural partitioning to drive primitive placement. (c) We implement adaptive residual pruning based on SDF update history to surpress over-segmentation and ensure compact results. In addition, Light-SQ supports multiscale fitting, enabling localized refinement to preserve fine geometric details. To evaluate our method, we introduce 3DGen-Prim, a benchmark extending 3DGen-Bench with new metrics for both reconstruction quality and primitive-level editability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Light-SQ enables efficient, high-fidelity, and editable shape abstraction with superquadrics for complex generated geometry, advancing the feasibility of 3D UGC creation."

2509.25094,"Recent 3D generative models produce high-quality textures for 3D mesh objects. However, they commonly rely on the heavy assumption that input 3D meshes are accompanied by manual mesh parameterization (UV mapping), a manual task that requires both technical precision and artistic judgment. Industry surveys show that this process often accounts for a significant share of asset creation, creating a major bottleneck for 3D content creators. Moreover, existing automatic methods often ignore two perceptually important criteria: (1) semantic awareness (UV charts should align semantically similar 3D parts across shapes) and (2) visibility awareness (cutting seams should lie in regions unlikely to be seen). To overcome these shortcomings and to automate the mesh parameterization process, we present an unsupervised differentiable framework that augments standard geometry-preserving UV learning with semantic- and visibility-aware objectives. For semantic-awareness, our pipeline (i) segments the mesh into semantic 3D parts, (ii) applies an unsupervised learned per-part UV-parameterization backbone, and (iii) aggregates per-part charts into a unified UV atlas. For visibility-awareness, we use ambient occlusion (AO) as an exposure proxy and back-propagate a soft differentiable AO-weighted seam objective to steer cutting seams toward occluded regions. By conducting qualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we show that the proposed method produces UV atlases that better support texture generation and reduce perceptible seam artifacts compared to recent baselines.

2509.25134,"Designers craft and edit graphic designs in a layer representation, but layer-based editing becomes impossible once composited into a raster image. In this work, we propose LayerD, a method to decompose raster graphic designs into layers for re-editable creative workflow. LayerD addresses the decomposition task by iteratively extracting unoccluded foreground layers. We propose a simple yet effective refinement approach taking advantage of the assumption that layers often exhibit uniform appearance in graphic designs. As decomposition is ill-posed and the ground-truth layer structure may not be reliable, we develop a quality metric that addresses the difficulty. In experiments, we show that LayerD successfully achieves high-quality decomposition and outperforms baselines. We also demonstrate the use of LayerD with state-of-the-art image generators and layer-based editing."
2509.25387,"Producing interactive 3D printed objects currently requires laborious 3D design and post-instrumentation with off-the-shelf electronics. Multi-material 3D printing using conductive PLA presents opportunities to mitigate these challenges. We present a computational design pipeline that embeds multiple capacitive touchpoints into any 3D model that has a closed mesh without self-intersection. With our pipeline, users define touchpoints on the 3D object's surface to indicate interactive regions. Our pipeline then automatically generates a conductive path to connect the touch regions. This path is optimized to output unique resistor-capacitor delays when each region is touched, resulting in all regions being able to be sensed through a double-wire or single-wire connection. We illustrate our approach's utility with five computational and sensing performance evaluations (achieving 93.35% mean accuracy for single-wire) and six application examples. Our sensing technique supports existing uses (e.g., prototyping) and highlights the growing promise to produce interactive devices entirely with 3D printing.Project website:this https URL"
2509.25392,"Linear reduced-order modeling (ROM) is widely used for efficient simulation of deformation dynamics, but its accuracy is often limited by the fixed linearization of the reduced mapping. We propose a new adaptive strategy for linear ROM that allows the reduced mapping to vary dynamically in response to the evolving deformation state, significantly improving accuracy over traditional linear approaches. To further handle large deformations, we introduce a historical displacement basis combined with Grassmann interpolation, enabling the system to recover robustly even in challenging scenarios. We evaluate our method through quantitative online-error analysis and qualitative comparisons with principal component analysis (PCA)-based linear ROM simulations, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains while preserving comparable computational costs."
2509.256,"Motion retargeting holds a premise of offering a larger set of motion data for characters and robots with different morphologies. Many prior works have approached this problem via either handcrafted constraints or paired motion datasets, limiting their applicability to humanoid characters or narrow behaviors such as locomotion. Moreover, they often assume a fixed notion of retargeting, overlooking domain-specific objectives like style preservation in animation or task-space alignment in robotics. In this work, we propose MoReFlow, Motion Retargeting via Flow Matching, an unsupervised framework that learns correspondences between characters' motion embedding spaces. Our method consists of two stages. First, we train tokenized motion embeddings for each character using a VQ-VAE, yielding compact latent representations. Then, we employ flow matching with conditional coupling to align the latent spaces across characters, which simultaneously learns conditioned and unconditioned matching to achieve robust but flexible retargeting. Once trained, MoReFlow enables flexible and reversible retargeting without requiring paired data. Experiments demonstrate that MoReFlow produces high-quality motions across diverse characters and tasks, offering improved controllability, generalization, and motion realism compared to the baselines."
2509.25857,"Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods. Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the robustness and compatibility of our approach."
2509.26055,"This paper presents GaussEdit, a framework for adaptive 3D scene editing guided by text and image prompts. GaussEdit leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as its backbone for scene representation, enabling convenient Region of Interest selection and efficient editing through a three-stage process. The first stage involves initializing the 3D Gaussians to ensure high-quality edits. The second stage employs an Adaptive Global-Local Optimization strategy to balance global scene coherence and detailed local edits and a category-guided regularization technique to alleviate the Janus problem. The final stage enhances the texture of the edited objects using a sophisticated image-to-image synthesis technique, ensuring that the results are visually realistic and align closely with the given prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that GaussEdit surpasses existing methods in editing accuracy, visual fidelity, and processing speed. By successfully embedding user-specified concepts into 3D scenes, GaussEdit is a powerful tool for detailed and user-driven 3D scene editing, offering significant improvements over traditional methods."
2509.26213,"Tensor datasets (two-, three-, or higher-dimensional) are fundamental to many scientific fields utilizing imaging or simulation technologies. Advances in these methods have led to ever-increasing data sizes and, consequently, interest and development of out-of-core processing and visualization techniques, although mostly as specialized solutions. Here we present Palace, an open-source, cross-platform, general-purpose library for interactive and accelerated out-of-core tensor processing and visualization. Through a high-performance asynchronous concurrent architecture and a simple compute-graph interface, Palace enables the interactive development of out-of-core pipelines on workstation hardware. We demonstrate on benchmarks that Palace outperforms or matches state-of-the-art systems for volume rendering and hierarchical random-walker segmentation and demonstrate applicability in use cases involving tensors from 2D images up to 4D time series datasets."
2509.26233,"Creating personalized 3D animations with precise control and realistic head motions remains challenging for current speech-driven 3D facial animation methods. Editing these animations is especially complex and time consuming, requires precise control and typically handled by highly skilled animators. Most existing works focus on controlling style or emotion of the synthesized animation and cannot edit/regenerate parts of an input animation. They also overlook the fact that multiple plausible lip and head movements can match the same audio input. To address these challenges, we present 3DiFACE, a novel method for holistic speech-driven 3D facial animation. Our approach produces diverse plausible lip and head motions for a single audio input and allows for editing via keyframing and interpolation. Specifically, we propose a fully-convolutional diffusion model that can leverage the viseme-level diversity in our training corpus. Additionally, we employ a speaking-style personalization and a novel sparsely-guided motion diffusion to enable precise control and editing. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our method is capable of generating and editing diverse holistic 3D facial animations given a single audio input, with control between high fidelity and diversity.

2510.00314,"Motion in-betweening is the problem to synthesize movement between keyposes. Traditional research focused primarily on single characters. Extending them to densely interacting characters is highly challenging, as it demands precise spatial-temporal correspondence between the characters to maintain the interaction, while creating natural transitions towards predefined keyposes. In this research, we present a method for long-horizon interaction in-betweening that enables two characters to engage and respond to one another naturally. To effectively represent and synthesize interactions, we propose a novel solution called Cross-Space In-Betweening, which models the interactions of each character across different conditioning representation spaces. We further observe that the significantly increased constraints in interacting characters heavily limit the solution space, leading to degraded motion quality and diminished interaction over time. To enable long-horizon synthesis, we present two solutions to maintain long-term interaction and motion quality, thereby keeping synthesis in the stable region of the solutionthis http URLfirst sustain interaction quality by identifying periodic interaction patterns through adversarial learning. We further maintain the motion quality by learning to refine the drifted latent space and prevent pose error accumulation. We demonstrate that our approach produces realistic, controllable, and long-horizon in-between motions of two characters with dynamic boxing and dancing actions across multiple keyposes, supported by extensive quantitative evaluations and user studies."
2510.01061,"Distribution matching is central to many vision and graphics tasks, where the widely used Wasserstein distance is too costly to compute for high dimensional distributions. The Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) offers a scalable alternative, yet its Monte Carlo estimator suffers from high variance, resulting in noisy gradients and slow convergence. We introduce Reservoir SWD (ReSWD), which integrates Weighted Reservoir Sampling into SWD to adaptively retain informative projection directions in optimization steps, resulting in stable gradients while remaining unbiased. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world tasks such as color correction and diffusion guidance show that ReSWD consistently outperforms standard SWD and other variance reduction baselines.

2510.01176,"We present an audio-driven real-time system for animating photorealistic 3D facial avatars with minimal latency, designed for social interactions in virtual reality for anyone. Central to our approach is an encoder model that transforms audio signals into latent facial expression sequences in real time, which are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the generative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of facial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving real-time performance (<15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes latency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates dependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates iterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design challenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals frame-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility of our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic modalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted eye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed. We validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various scenarios such as multilingual speeches."
2510.01619,"While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1) dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation generalizability.

2510.0169,"Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) overlays digital targets and annotations on the physical world, offering promising guidance for hands-on tasks such as medical needle insertion or assembly. Recent work on OST-AR depth perception shows that target opacity and tool visualization significantly affect accuracy and usability; opaque targets and rendering the real instrument reduce depth errors, whereas transparent targets and absent tools impair performance. However, reliance on visual overlays may overload attention and leaves little room for depth cues when occlusion or lighting hampers perception. To address these limitations, we explore multimodal feedback that combines OST-AR with wrist-based vibrotactile haptics. The past two years have seen rapid advances in haptic technology. Researchers have investigated skin-stretch and vibrotactile cues for conveying spatial information to blind users, wearable ring actuators that support precise pinching in AR, cross-modal audio-haptic cursors that enable eyes-free object selection, and wrist-worn feedback for teleoperated surgery that improves force awareness at the cost of longer task times. Studies comparing pull versus push vibrotactile metaphors found that pull cues yield faster gesture completion and lower cognitive load. These findings motivate revisiting OST-AR guidance with a fresh perspective on wrist-based haptics. We design a custom wristband with six vibromotors delivering directional and state cues, integrate it with a handheld tool and OST-AR, and assess its impact on cue recognition and depth guidance. Through a formative study and two experiments (N=21 and N=27), we show that participants accurately identify haptic patterns under cognitive load and that multimodal feedback improves spatial precision and usability compared with visual-only or haptic-only conditions."
2510.01743,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an indispensable diagnostic tool, yet the confined bore and acoustic noise can evoke considerable anxiety and claustrophobic reactions. High anxiety leads to motion artifacts, incomplete scans and reliance on pharmacological sedation. MIRAGE (Mixed Reality Anxiety Guidance Environment) harnesses the latest mixed reality (MR) hardware to prepare patients for MRI through immersive virtual reality (VR) and markerless augmented reality (AR) registration. In this paper, we extend our previous work by providing a comprehensive review of related research, detailing the system architecture, and exploring metrics for patient and clinician experience. We also present considerations for clinical deployment of MR systems within hospital workflows. Our results indicate that depth-based registration achieves sub-centimeter accuracy with minimal setup, while the immersive coaching environment reduces patient anxiety and yields favourable usability scores."
2510.01978,"We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by $\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a single object of interest, outperforming existing methods."
2510.02069,"Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to existing Gaussian splatting methods."
2510.0239,"The diffusion model is a state-of-the-art generative model that generates an image by applying a neural network iteratively. Moreover, this generation process is regarded as an algorithm solving an ordinary differential equation or a stochastic differential equation. Based on the analysis of the truncation error of the diffusion ODE and SDE, our study proposes a training-free algorithm that generates high-quality 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 images in eight steps, with flexible guidance scales. To the best of my knowledge, our algorithm is the first one that samples a 1024 x 1024 resolution image in 8 steps with an FID performance comparable to that of the latest distillation model, but without additional training. Meanwhile, our algorithm can also generate a 512 x 512 image in 8 steps, and its FID performance is better than the inference result using state-of-the-art ODE solver DPM++ 2m in 20 steps. We validate our eight-step image generation algorithm using the COCO 2014, COCO 2017, and LAION datasets. And our best FID performance is 15.7, 22.35, and 17.52. While the FID performance of DPM++2m is 17.3, 23.75, and 17.33. Further, it also outperforms the state-of-the-art AMED-plugin solver, whose FID performance is 19.07, 25.50, and 18.06. We also apply the algorithm in five-step inference without additional training, for which the best FID performance in the datasets mentioned above is 19.18, 23.24, and 19.61, respectively, and is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art AMED Pulgin solver in eight steps, SDXL-turbo in four steps, and the state-of-the-art diffusion distillation model Flash Diffusion in five steps. We also validate our algorithm in synthesizing 1024 * 1024 images within 6 steps, whose FID performance only has a limited distance to the latest distillation algorithm.

2510.02651,"The visualization of 3D point cloud data is essential in fields such as autonomous navigation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response, where tasks like object recognition, structural analysis, and spatiotemporal exploration rely on clear and effective visual representation. Despite advancements in AI-driven processing, visualization remains a critical tool for interpreting complex spatial datasets. However, designing effective point cloud visualizations presents significant challenges due to the sparsity, density variations, and scale of the data. In this work, we analyze the design space of spatial point cloud visualization, highlighting a gap in systematically mapping visualization techniques to analytical objectives. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes four decades of visualization design choices, linking them to fundamental challenges in modern applications. By structuring visualization strategies based on data types, user objectives, and visualization techniques, our framework provides a foundation for advancing more effective, interpretable, and user-centered visualization techniques."
2510.02884,"Constructing and sharing 3D maps is essential for many applications, including autonomous driving and augmented reality. Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as a promising approach for accurate 3D reconstruction. However, a practical map-sharing system that features high-fidelity, continuous updates, and network efficiency remains elusive. To address these challenges, we introduce GS-Share, a photorealistic map-sharing system with a compact representation. The core of GS-Share includes anchor-based global map construction, virtual-image-based map enhancement, and incremental map update. We evaluate GS-Share against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our system achieves higher fidelity, particularly for extrapolated views, with improvements of 11%, 22%, and 74% in PSNR, LPIPS, and Depth L1, respectively. Furthermore, GS-Share is significantly more compact, reducing map transmission overhead by 36%."
2510.03308,"In this paper, we formulate the problem of kinematic synthesis for planar linkages as a cross-domain image generation task. We develop a planar linkages dataset using RGB image representations, covering a range of mechanisms: from simple types such as crank-rocker and crank-slider to more complex eight-bar linkages like Jansen's mechanism. A shared-latent variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed to explore the potential of image generative models for synthesizing unseen motion curves and simulating novel kinematics. By encoding the drawing speed of trajectory points as color gradients, the same architecture also supports kinematic synthesis conditioned on both trajectory shape and velocity profiles. We validate our method on three datasets of increasing complexity: a standard four-bar linkage set, a mixed set of four-bar and crank-slider mechanisms, and a complex set including multi-loop mechanisms. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of image-based representations for generative mechanical design, showing that mechanisms with revolute and prismatic joints, and potentially cams and gears, can be represented and synthesized within a unified image generation framework."
2510.03312,"We introduce Universal Beta Splatting (UBS), a unified framework that generalizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernels for explicit radiance field rendering. Unlike fixed Gaussian primitives, Beta kernels enable controllable dependency modeling across spatial, angular, and temporal dimensions within a single representation. Our unified approach captures complex light transport effects, handles anisotropic view-dependent appearance, and models scene dynamics without requiring auxiliary networks or specific color encodings. UBS maintains backward compatibility by approximating to Gaussian Splatting as a special case, guaranteeing plug-in usability and lower performance bounds. The learned Beta parameters naturally decompose scene properties into interpretable without explicit supervision: spatial (surface vs. texture), angular (diffuse vs. specular), and temporal (static vs. dynamic). Our CUDA-accelerated implementation achieves real-time rendering while consistently outperforming existing methods across static, view-dependent, and dynamic benchmarks, establishing Beta kernels as a scalable universal primitive for radiance field rendering.

Our approach extends traditional 3D style transfer methods by introducing a novel loss function that captures style directionality, supports multiple style images or portions thereof, and enables smooth transitions between styles in the synthesized texture. The use of easily generated guiding textures streamlines user interaction, making our approach accessible to a broad audience. Extensive evaluations with various meshes, style images, and contour shapes demonstrate the flexibility of our method and showcase the visual appeal of the generated textures."
2510.03434,"We present Paris, the first publicly released diffusion model pre-trained entirely through decentralized computation. Paris demonstrates that high-quality text-to-image generation can be achieved without centrally coordinated infrastructure. Paris is open for research and commercial use. Paris required implementing our Distributed Diffusion Training framework from scratch. The model consists of 8 expert diffusion models (129M-605M parameters each) trained in complete isolation with no gradient, parameter, or intermediate activation synchronization. Rather than requiring synchronized gradient updates across thousands of GPUs, we partition data into semantically coherent clusters where each expert independently optimizes its subset while collectively approximating the full distribution. A lightweight transformer router dynamically selects appropriate experts at inference, achieving generation quality comparable to centrally coordinated baselines. Eliminating synchronization enables training on heterogeneous hardware without specialized interconnects. Empirical validation confirms that Paris's decentralized training maintains generation quality while removing the dedicated GPU cluster requirement for large-scale diffusion models. Paris achieves this using 14$\times$ less training data and 16$\times$ less compute than the prior decentralized baseline."
2510.03597,"Scaling generative AI models is bottlenecked by the scarcity of high-quality training data. The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using (unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the purpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately, however, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder (MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality and/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation frOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from self-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model, Neon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then, counterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the degraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers that favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between the synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation corrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is remarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new real data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically uses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's universality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching, autoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the xAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional training compute. Code is available atthis https URL"
2510.03813,"Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-fidelity images, largely enabled by text-guided inference. However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices."
2510.03837,"We propose a simple, data-efficient pipeline that augments an implicit reconstruction network based on neural SDF-based CAD parts with a part-segmentation head trained under PartField-generated supervision. Unlike methods tied to fixed taxonomies, our model accepts meshes with any number of parts and produces coherent, geometry-aligned labels in a single pass. We evaluate on randomly sampled CAD meshes from the ABC dataset with intentionally varied part cardinalities, including over-segmented shapes, and report strong performance across reconstruction (CDL1/CDL2, F1-micro, NC) and segmentation (mIoU, Accuracy), together with a new Segmentation Consistency metric that captures local label smoothness. We attach a lightweight segmentation head to the Flat-CAD SDF trunk; on a paired evaluation it does not alter reconstruction while providing accurate part labels for meshes with any number of parts. Even under degraded reconstructions on thin or intricate geometries, segmentation remains accurate and label-coherent, often preserving the correct part count. Our approach therefore offers a practical route to semantically structured CAD meshes without requiring curated taxonomies or exact palette matches. We discuss limitations in boundary precision, partly due to per-face supervision, and outline paths toward boundary-aware training and higher resolution labels."
2510.03964,"Spatiotemporal sensitivity to high frequency information declines with increased peripheral eccentricity. Foveated rendering exploits this by decreasing the spatial resolution of rendered images in peripheral vision, reducing the rendering cost by omitting high frequency details. As foveation levels increase, the rendering quality is reduced, and traditional foveated rendering systems tend not to preserve samples that were previously rendered at high spatial resolution in previous frames. Additionally, prior research has shown that saccade landing positions are distributed around a target location rather than landing at a single point, and that even during fixations, eyes perform small microsaccades around a fixation point. This creates an opportunity for sampling from temporally neighbouring frames with differing foveal locations to reduce the required rendered size of the foveal region while achieving a higher perceived image quality. We further observe that the temporal presentation of pixels frame-to-frame can be viewed as a data stream, presenting a random sampling problem. Following this intuition, we propose a Weighted Reservoir Sampling technique to efficiently maintain a reservoir of the perceptually relevant high quality pixel samples from previous frames and incorporate them into the computation of the current frame. This allows the renderer to render a smaller region of foveal pixels per frame by temporally reusing pixel samples that are still relevant to reconstruct a higher perceived image quality, while allowing for higher levels of foveation. Our method operates on the output of foveated rendering, and runs in under 1\,ms at 4K resolution, making it highly efficient and integrable with real-time VR and AR foveated rendering systems."
2510.04536,"This paper proposes ""3Dify,"" a procedural 3D computer graphics (3D-CG) generation framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework enables users to generate 3D-CG content solely through natural language instructions. 3Dify is built upon Dify, an open-source platform for AI application development, and incorporates several state-of-the-art LLM-related technologies such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). For 3D-CG generation support, 3Dify automates the operation of various Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools via MCP. When DCC tools do not support MCP-based interaction, the framework employs the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) method to automate Graphical User Interface (GUI) operations. Moreover, to enhance image generation quality, 3Dify allows users to provide feedback by selecting preferred images from multiple candidates. The LLM then learns variable patterns from these selections and applies them to subsequent generations. Furthermore, 3Dify supports the integration of locally deployed LLMs, enabling users to utilize custom-developed models and to reduce both time and monetary costs associated with external API calls by leveraging their own computational resources."
2510.04539,"Existing 2D-lifting-based 3D editing methods often encounter challenges related to inconsistency, stemming from the lack of view-consistent 2D editing models and the difficulty of ensuring consistent editing across multiple views. To address these issues, we propose C3Editor, a controllable and consistent 2D-lifting-based 3D editing framework. Given an original 3D representation and a text-based editing prompt, our method selectively establishes a view-consistent 2D editing model to achieve superior 3D editing results. The process begins with the controlled selection of a ground truth (GT) view and its corresponding edited image as the optimization target, allowing for user-defined manual edits. Next, we fine-tune the 2D editing model within the GT view and across multiple views to align with the GT-edited image while ensuring multi-view consistency. To meet the distinct requirements of GT view fitting and multi-view consistency, we introduce separate LoRA modules for targeted fine-tuning. Our approach delivers more consistent and controllable 2D and 3D editing results than existing 2D-lifting-based methods, outperforming them in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations."
2510.04637,"We present Social Agent, a novel framework for synthesizing realistic and contextually appropriate co-speech nonverbal behaviors in dyadic conversations. In this framework, we develop an agentic system driven by a Large Language Model (LLM) to direct the conversation flow and determine appropriate interactive behaviors for both participants. Additionally, we propose a novel dual-person gesture generation model based on an auto-regressive diffusion model, which synthesizes coordinated motions from speech signals. The output of the agentic system is translated into high-level guidance for the gesture generator, resulting in realistic movement at both the behavioral and motion levels. Furthermore, the agentic system periodically examines the movements of interlocutors and infers their intentions, forming a continuous feedback loop that enables dynamic and responsive interactions between the two participants. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that our model significantly improves the quality of dyadic interactions, producing natural, synchronized nonverbal behaviors."

From its inception, the field has advanced from adversarial models to diffusion-based models, yielding higher-fidelity, temporally consistent outputs. Yet challenges persist, such as alignment, long-range coherence, and computational efficiency. Addressing this evolving landscape, we present a comprehensive survey of text-to-video generative models, tracing their development from early GANs and VAEs to hybrid Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) architectures, detailing how these models work, what limitations they addressed in their predecessors, and why shifts toward new architectural paradigms were necessary to overcome challenges in quality, coherence, and control. We provide a systematic account of the datasets, which the surveyed text-to-video models were trained and evaluated on, and, to support reproducibility and assess the accessibility of training such models, we detail their training configurations, including their hardware specifications, GPU counts, batch sizes, learning rates, optimizers, epochs, and other key hyperparameters. Further, we outline the evaluation metrics commonly used for evaluating such models and present their performance across standard benchmarks, while also discussing the limitations of these metrics and the emerging shift toward more holistic, perception-aligned evaluation strategies. Finally, drawing from our analysis, we outline the current open challenges and propose a few promising future directions, laying out a perspective for future researchers to explore and build upon in advancing T2V research and applications."
2510.05081,"Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have become the backbone of modern image editing, yet text prompts alone do not offer adequate control over the editing process. Two properties are especially desirable: disentanglement, where changing one attribute does not unintentionally alter others, and continuous control, where the strength of an edit can be smoothly adjusted. We introduce a method for disentangled and continuous editing through token-level manipulation of text embeddings. The edits are applied by manipulating the embeddings along carefully chosen directions, which control the strength of the target attribute. To identify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically isolated dimensions. Our method operates directly on text embeddings without modifying the diffusion process, making it model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image synthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables intuitive and efficient manipulations with continuous control across diverse attributes and domains."
2510.05097,"Treating human motion and camera trajectory generation separately overlooks a core principle of cinematography: the tight interplay between actor performance and camera work in the screen space. In this paper, we are the first to cast this task as a text-conditioned joint generation, aiming to maintain consistent on-screen framing while producing two heterogeneous, yet intrinsically linked, modalities: human motion and camera trajectories. We propose a simple, model-agnostic framework that enforces multimodal coherence via an auxiliary modality: the on-screen framing induced by projecting human joints onto the camera. This on-screen framing provides a natural and effective bridge between modalities, promoting consistency and leading to more precise joint distribution. We first design a joint autoencoder that learns a shared latent space, together with a lightweight linear transform from the human and camera latents to a framing latent. We then introduce auxiliary sampling, which exploits this linear transform to steer generation toward a coherent framing modality. To support this task, we also introduce the PulpMotion dataset, a human-motion and camera-trajectory dataset with rich captions, and high-quality human motions. Extensive experiments across DiT- and MAR-based architectures show the generality and effectiveness of our method in generating on-frame coherent human-camera motions, while also achieving gains on textual alignment for both modalities. Our qualitative results yield more cinematographically meaningful framings setting the new state of the art for this task. Code, models and data are available in our \href{this https URL}{project page}."
2510.06517,"This work walks through different visualization techniques for combinatorial search landscapes, focusing on multimodality. We discuss different techniques from the landscape analysis literature, and how they can be combined to provide a more comprehensive view of the search landscape. We also include examples and discuss relevant work to show how others have used these techniques in practice, based on the geometric and aesthetic elements of the Grammar of Graphics. We conclude that there is no free lunch in visualization, and provide recommendations for future work as there are several paths to continue the work in this field."
2510.06802,"Capturing and rendering three-dimensional (3D) objects in real time remain a significant challenge, yet hold substantial potential for applications in augmented reality, digital twin systems, remote collaboration and prototyping. We present an end-to-end pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) to enable rapid acquisition and interactive rendering of real-world objects using a mobile device, cloud processing and a local computer. Users scan an object with a smartphone video, upload it for automated 3D reconstruction, and visualize it interactively in Unity at an average of 150 frames per second (fps) on a laptop. The system integrates mobile capture, cloud-based 3D GS and Unity rendering to support real-time telepresence. Our experiments show that the pipeline processes scans in approximately 10 minutes on a graphics processing unit (GPU) achieving real-time rendering on the laptop."
2510.07275,"Walk on stars (WoSt) is currently one of the most advanced Monte Carlo solvers for PDEs. Unfortunately, the lack of reliable geometric query approaches has hindered its applicability to boundaries defined by implicit surfaces. This work proposes a geometric query framework over closed implicit surfaces for WoSt, under the scope of walkin' Robin. Our key observation is that all WoSt queries can be formulated as constrained global optimization or constraint satisfaction problems. Based on our formulations, to solve the highly non-convex problems, we adopt a branch-and-bound approach based on interval analysis. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to study closest silhouette point queries and Robin radius bound queries on closed implicit surfaces. Our formulations and methods first enable mesh-free PDE solving via WoSt when boundaries are defined by closed implicit surfaces."
2510.0734,"Personalized image generation aims to faithfully preserve a reference subject's identity while adapting to diverse text prompts. Existing optimization-based methods ensure high fidelity but are computationally expensive, while learning-based approaches offer efficiency at the cost of entangled representations influenced by nuisance factors. We introduce SpotDiff, a novel learning-based method that extracts subject-specific features by spotting and disentangling interference. Leveraging a pre-trained CLIP image encoder and specialized expert networks for pose and background, SpotDiff isolates subject identity through orthogonality constraints in the feature space. To enable principled training, we introduce SpotDiff10k, a curated dataset with consistent pose and background variations. Experiments demonstrate that SpotDiff achieves more robust subject preservation and controllable editing than prior methods, while attaining competitive performance with only 10k training samples."
2510.07343,"Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) provides a principled Bayesian approach to inverse problems by sampling from $p(x_0 \mid y)$. However, in practice, the goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically interpretable covariance approximation, a reformulated objective for stability and interpretability, and a gradient approximation for non-differentiable operators. Across a broad set of image restoration and scientific tasks, LMAPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, including $\geq 2$ dB gains on motion deblurring, JPEG restoration, and quantization, and $>1.5$ dB improvements on inverse scattering benchmarks."
2510.07638,"Editing and animating text appearance for graphic designs, commercials, etc. remain highly skilled tasks requiring detailed, hands on efforts from artists. Automating these manual workflows requires balancing the competing goals of maintaining legibility and aesthetics of text, while enabling creative expression. Variable fonts, recent parametric extensions to traditional fonts, offer the promise of new ways to ease and automate typographic design and animation. Variable fonts provide custom constructed parameters along which fonts can be smoothly varied. These parameterizations could then potentially serve as high value continuous design spaces, opening the door to automated design optimization tools. However, currently variable fonts are underutilized in creative applications, because artists so far still need to manually tune font parameters. Our work opens the door to intuitive and automated font design and animation workflows with differentiable variable fonts. To do so we distill the current variable font specification to a compact mathematical formulation that differentiably connects the highly non linear, non invertible mapping of variable font parameters to the underlying vector graphics representing the text. This enables us to construct a differentiable framework, with respect to variable font parameters, allowing us to perform gradient based optimization of energies defined on vector graphics control points, and on target rasterized images. We demonstrate the utility of this framework with four applications: direct shape manipulation, overlap aware modeling, physics based text animation, and automated font design optimization. Our work now enables leveraging the carefully designed affordances of variable fonts with differentiability to use modern design optimization technologies, opening new possibilities for easy and intuitive typographic design workflows."
2510.07868,"We propose a novel framework for Russian Roulette and Splitting (RRS) tailored to wavefront path tracing, a highly parallel rendering architecture that processes path states in batched, stage-wise execution for efficient GPU utilization. Traditional RRS methods, with unpredictable path counts, are fundamentally incompatible with wavefront's preallocated memory and scheduling requirements. To resolve this, we introduce a normalized RRS formulation with a bounded path count, enabling stable and memory-efficient execution.Furthermore, we pioneer the use of neural networks to learn RRS factors, presenting two models: NRRS and AID-NRRS. At a high level, both feature a carefully designed RRSNet that explicitly incorporates RRS normalization, with only subtle differences in their implementation. To balance computational cost and inference accuracy, we introduce Mix-Depth, a path-depth-aware mechanism that adaptively regulates neural evaluation, further improving efficiency.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional heuristics and recent RRS techniques in both rendering quality and performance across a variety of complex scenes."
2510.08166,"Although variable-rate compressed image formats such as JPEG are widely used to efficiently encode images, they have not found their way into real-time rendering due to special requirements such as random access to individual texels. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of variable-rate texture compression on modern GPUs using the JPEG format, and how it compares to the GPU-friendly fixed-rate compression approaches BC1 and ASTC. Using a deferred rendering pipeline, we are able to identify the subset of blocks that are needed for a given frame, decode these, and colorize the framebuffer's pixels. Despite the additional $\sim$0.17 bit per pixel that we require for our approach, JPEG maintains significantly better quality and compression rates compared to BC1, and depending on the type of image, outperforms or competes with ASTC. The JPEG rendering pipeline increases rendering duration by less than 0.3 ms on an RTX 4090, demonstrating that sophisticated variable-rate compression schemes are feasible on modern GPUs, even in VR.

2510.08271,"We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other visual media."
2510.08394,"Neural fields excel at representing continuous visual signals but typically operate at a single, fixed resolution. We present a simple yet powerful method to optimize neural fields that can be prefiltered in a single forward pass. Key innovations and features include: (1) We perform convolutional filtering in the input domain by analytically scaling Fourier feature embeddings with the filter's frequency response. (2) This closed-form modulation generalizes beyond Gaussian filtering and supports other parametric filters (Box and Lanczos) that are unseen at training time. (3) We train the neural field using single-sample Monte Carlo estimates of the filtered signal. Our method is fast during both training and inference, and imposes no additional constraints on the network architecture. We show quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing methods for neural-field filtering."
2510.08491,"Radiance fields have emerged as a predominant representation for modeling 3D scene appearance. Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power. Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\times$ fewer primitives and $6\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or adaptation frameworks. The project page isthis https URL."
2510.0853,"We present X2Video, the first diffusion model for rendering photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic channels including albedo, normal, roughness, metallicity, and irradiance, while supporting intuitive multi-modal controls with reference images and text prompts for both global and local regions. The intrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry, and lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive adjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these functionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to video generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention, which ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances fidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to disentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto respective local and global regions. For generating long videos, our novel Recursive Sampling method incorporates progressive frame sampling, combining keyframe prediction and frame interpolation to maintain long-range temporal consistency while preventing error accumulation. To support the training of X2Video, we assembled a video dataset named InteriorVideo, featuring 1,154 rooms from 295 interior scenes, complete with reliable ground-truth intrinsic channel sequences and smooth camera trajectories. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally consistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions. Additionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with reference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports editing on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.

2510.08645,"The sizing field defined on a triangular background grid is pivotal for controlling the quality and efficiency of unstructured mesh generation. However, creating an optimal background grid that is geometrically conforming, computationally lightweight, and free from artifacts like banding is a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel, adaptive background grid simplification (ABGS) framework based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). We reformulate the grid simplification task as an edge score regression problem and train a GCN model to efficiently predict optimal edge collapse candidates. The model is guided by a custom loss function that holistically considers both geometric fidelity and sizing field accuracy. This data-driven approach replaces a costly procedural evaluation, accelerating the simplification process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across diverse and complex engineering models. Compared to the initial dense grids, our simplified background grids achieve an element reduction of 74%-94%, leading to a 35%-88% decrease in sizing field query times."
2510.08656,"Recent advancements in AI-driven 3D model generation have leveraged cross modality, yet generating models with smooth surfaces and minimizing storage overhead remain challenges. This paper introduces a novel multi-stage framework for generating 3D models composed of parameterized primitives, guided by textual and image inputs. In the framework, A model generation algorithm based on parameterized primitives, is proposed, which can identifies the shape features of the model constituent elements, and replace the elements with parameterized primitives with high quality surface. In addition, a corresponding model storage method is proposed, it can ensure the original surface quality of the model, while retaining only the parameters of parameterized primitives. Experiments on virtual scene dataset and real scene dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a Chamfer Distance of 0.003092, a VIoU of 0.545, a F1-Score of 0.9139 and a NC of 0.8369, with primitive parameter files approximately 6KB in size. Our approach is particularly suitable for rapid prototyping of simple models."
2510.09078,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has made unprecedented advances in vision language models over the past two years. During the generative process, new samples (images) are generated from an unknown high-dimensional distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly effective in drawing samples from such complex, high-dimensional distributions. This makes MCMC methods an integral component for models like EBMs, ensuring accurate sample generation.Gradient-based optimization is at the core of modern generative models. The update step during the optimization forms a Markov chain where the new update depends only on the current state. This allows exploration of the parameter space in a memoryless manner, thus combining the benefits of gradient-based optimization and MCMC sampling. MCMC methods have shown an equally important role in physically based rendering where complex light paths are otherwise quite challenging to sample from simple importance sampling techniques.A lot of research is dedicated towards bringing physical realism to samples (images) generated from diffusion-based generative models in a data-driven manner, however, a unified framework connecting these techniques is still missing. In this course, we take the first steps toward understanding each of these components and exploring how MCMC could potentially serve as a bridge, linking these closely related areas of research. Our course aims to provide necessary theoretical and practical tools to guide students, researchers and practitioners towards the common goal of generative physically based rendering.

2510.09081,"Real-time rendering of dynamic line sets is relevant in many visualization tasks, including unsteady flow visualization and interactive white matter reconstruction from Magnetic Resonance Imaging. High-quality global illumination and transparency are important for conveying the spatial structure of dense line sets, yet remain difficult to achieve at interactive rates. We propose an efficient voxel-based ray-tracing framework for rendering large dynamic line sets with ambient occlusion and ground-truth transparency. The framework introduces a voxelization algorithm that supports efficient construction of acceleration structures for both voxel cone tracing and ray tracing. To further reduce per-frame preprocessing cost, we developed a voxel-based culling method that restricts acceleration structure construction to camera-visible voxels. Together, these contributions enable high-quality, real-time rendering of large-scale dynamic line sets with physically accurate transparency. The results show that our method outperforms the state of the art in quality and performance when rendering (semi-)opaque dynamic line sets."
2510.09489,"Outdoor scene reconstruction remains challenging due to the stark contrast between well-textured, nearby regions and distant backgrounds dominated by low detail, uneven illumination, and sky effects. We introduce a two-stage Gaussian Splatting framework that explicitly separates and optimizes these regions, yielding higher-fidelity novel view synthesis. In stage one, background primitives are initialized within a spherical shell and optimized using a loss that combines a background-only photometric term with two geometric regularizers: one constraining Gaussians to remain inside the shell, and another aligning them with local tangential planes. In stage two, foreground Gaussians are initialized from a Structure-from-Motion reconstruction, added and refined using the standard rendering loss, while the background set remains fixed but contributes to the final image formation. Experiments on diverse outdoor datasets show that our method reduces background artifacts and improves perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the explicit background separation enables automatic, object-free environment map estimation, opening new possibilities for photorealistic outdoor rendering and mixed-reality applications."
2510.09997,"Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels (DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and causes jarring visual ``popping"" artifacts during transitions, degrading the user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm: Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity. This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of performance targets."

This survey explores recent trends and innovations in sketch animation, with a focus on methods that have advanced the state of the art. The paper categorizes and evaluates key methodologies, including keyframe interpolation, physics-based animation, data-driven, motion capture, and deep learning approaches. We examine the integration of artificial intelligence, real-time rendering, and cloud-based solutions, highlighting their impact on enhancing realism, scalability, and interactivity. Additionally, the survey delves into the challenges of computational complexity, scalability, and user-friendly interfaces, as well as emerging opportunities within metaverse applications and human-machine interaction. By synthesizing insights from a wide array of research, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape and future directions of sketch animation, serving as a resource for both academics and industry professionals seeking to innovate in this dynamic field."
2510.10256,"In this work we analyze and address a fundamental restriction that blocks the reliable application of codimensional yarn-level and shell models with thickness, to simulate real-world woven and knit fabrics. As discretizations refine toward practical and accurate physical modeling, such models can generate non-physical contact forces with stencil-neighboring elements in the simulation mesh, leading to severe locking artifacts. While not well-documented in the literature, this restriction has so far been addressed with two alternatives with undesirable tradeoffs. One option is to restrict the mesh to coarse resolutions, however, this eliminates the possibility of accurate (and consistent) resolution simulations across real-world material variations. A second alternative instead seeks to cull contact pairs that can create such locking forces in the first place. This relaxes resolution restrictions but compromise robustness. Culling can and will generate unacceptable and unpredictable geometric intersections and tunneling that destroys weaving and knitting structures and cause unrecoverable pull-throughs. We address these challenges to simulating real-world materials with a new and practical contact-processing model for thickened codimensional simulation, that removes resolution restrictions, while guaranteeing contact-locking-free, non-intersecting simulations. We demonstrate the application of our model across a wide range of previously unavailable simulation scenarios, with real-world material yarn and fabric parameters and patterns, challenging simulation conditions and mesh resolutions, and both rod and shell models, integrated with the IPC barrier."
2510.10581,"Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models excel at complex tasks through coordinated collaboration, yet they face high failure rates in multi-turn deep search scenarios. Existing temporal attribution methods struggle to accurately diagnose root causes, particularly when errors propagate across multiple agents. Attempts to automate failure attribution by analyzing action sequences remain ineffective due to their inability to account for information dependencies that span agents. This paper identifies two core challenges: \textit{(i) distinguishing symptoms from root causes in multi-agent error propagation}, and \textit{(ii) tracing information dependencies beyond temporal order}. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{GraphTracer}, a framework that redefines failure attribution through information flow analysis. GraphTracer constructs Information Dependency Graphs (IDGs) to explicitly capture how agents reference and build on prior outputs. It localizes root causes by tracing through these dependency structures instead of relying on temporal sequences. GraphTracer also uses graph-aware synthetic data generation to target critical nodes, creating realistic failure scenarios. Evaluations on the Who\&When benchmark and integration into production systems demonstrate that GraphTracer-8B achieves up to 18.18\% higher attribution accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and enables 4.8\% to 14.2\% performance improvements in deployed multi-agent frameworks, establishing a robust solution for multi-agent system debugging."
2510.10585,"Multi-agent systems powered by large language models exhibit strong capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. However, these systems suffer from substantial knowledge redundancy. Agents duplicate efforts in retrieval and reasoning processes. This inefficiency stems from a deeper issue: current architectures lack mechanisms to ensure agents share minimal sufficient information at each operational stage. Empirical analysis reveals an average knowledge duplication rate of 47.3\% across agent communications. We propose D3MAS (Decompose, Deduce, and Distribute), a hierarchical coordination framework addressing redundancy through structural design rather than explicit optimization. The framework organizes collaboration across three coordinated layers. Task decomposition filters irrelevant sub-problems early. Collaborative reasoning captures complementary inference paths across agents. Distributed memory provides access to non-redundant knowledge. These layers coordinate through structured message passing in a unified heterogeneous graph. This cross-layer alignment ensures information remains aligned with actual task needs. Experiments on four challenging datasets show that D3MAS consistently improves reasoning accuracy by 8.7\% to 15.6\% and reduces knowledge redundancy by 46\% on average."
2510.10715,"Creative generation is the synthesis of new, surprising, and valuable samples that reflect user intent yet cannot be envisioned in advance. This task aims to extend human imagination, enabling the discovery of visual concepts that exist in the unexplored spaces between familiar domains. While text-to-image diffusion models excel at rendering photorealistic scenes that faithfully match user prompts, they still struggle to generate genuinely novel content. Existing approaches to enhance generative creativity either rely on interpolation of image features, which restricts exploration to predefined categories, or require time-intensive procedures such as embedding optimization or model fine-tuning. We propose VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting, a training-free, inference-time method that promotes creative image generation while preserving the validity of the generated object. Our approach utilizes a vision-language model (VLM) that analyzes intermediate outputs of the generation process and adaptively steers it away from conventional visual concepts, encouraging the emergence of novel and surprising outputs. We evaluate creativity through both novelty and validity, using statistical metrics in the CLIP embedding space. Through extensive experiments, we show consistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead. Moreover, unlike existing methods that primarily generate single objects, our approach extends to complex scenarios, such as generating coherent sets of creative objects and preserving creativity within elaborate compositional prompts. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines, offering a practical route to producing creative outputs that venture beyond the constraints of textual descriptions."
2510.10751,"We propose a novel optimization framework for computing the medial axis transform that simultaneously preserves the medial structure and ensures high medial mesh quality. The medial structure, consisting of interconnected sheets, seams, and junctions, provides a natural volumetric decomposition of a 3D shape. Our method introduces a structure-aware, particle-based optimization pipeline guided by the restricted power diagram (RPD), which partitions the input volume into convex cells whose dual encodes the connectivity of the medial mesh. Structure-awareness is enforced through a spherical quadratic error metric (SQEM) projection that constrains the movement of medial spheres, while a Gaussian kernel energy encourages an even spatial distribution. Compared to feature-preserving methods such as MATFP and MATTopo, our approach produces cleaner and more accurate medial structures with significantly improved mesh quality. In contrast to voxel-based, point-cloud-based, and variational methods, our framework is the first to integrate structural awareness into the optimization process, yielding medial meshes with superior geometric fidelity, topological correctness, and explicit structural decomposition."

2510.11878,"As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce GS-Verse (Gaussian Splatting for Virtual Environment Rendering and Scene Editing), a novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, GS-Verse facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow. Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods."
2510.12053,"We introduce Coordinate Condensation, a variant of coordinate descent that accelerates physics-based simulation by augmenting local coordinate updates with a Schur-complement-based subspace correction. Recent work by Lan et al. 2025 (JGS2) uses perturbation subspaces to augment local solves to account for global coupling, but their approach introduces damping that can degrade convergence. We reuse this subspace but solve for local and subspace displacements independently, eliminating this damping. For problems where the subspace adequately captures global coupling, our method achieves near-Newton convergence while retaining the efficiency and parallelism of coordinate descent. Through experiments across varying material stiffnesses and mesh resolutions, we show substantially faster convergence than both standard coordinate descent and JGS2. We also characterize when subspace-based coordinate methods succeed or fail, offering insights for future solver design."
2510.12087,"Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrates structural connectivity with rich textual semantics, enabling applications in diverse domains. Current methods largely rely on contrastive learning to maximize cross-modal similarity, assuming tighter coupling between graph and text representations improves transfer performance. However, our empirical analysis reveals that both natural gap expansion and forced gap reduction result in performance degradation by disrupting pre-trained knowledge structures and impairing generalization. This arises from the geometric incompatibility between encoders, where graph encoders capture topological patterns, while text encoders capture semantic structures. Over-alignment compresses these distinct spaces into shared subspaces, causing structure collapse that diminishes both topological reasoning and semantic understanding. We propose \textbf{LLM4GTA}, a gap-aware alignment framework that preserves representation gaps as geometric necessities for maintaining modality-specific knowledge and improving transfer performance. LLM4GTA includes an adaptive gap preservation module to prevent over-alignment by monitoring similarity evolution and an intra-modal compensation mechanism that boosts discriminative power using auxiliary classifiers in graph space. Extensive experiments show significant improvements over existing methods in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios."
2510.12192,"Freehand sketches exhibit unique sparsity and abstraction, necessitating learning pipelines distinct from those designed for images. For sketch learning methods, the central objective is to fully exploit the effective information embedded in sketches. However, there is limited research on what constitutes effective sketch information, which in turn constrains the performance of existing approaches. To tackle this issue, we first proposed the Multi-Level Sketch Representation Scheme to systematically identify the effective information. The scheme organizes sketch representation into three levels: sketch-level, stroke-level, and point-level. This design is based on the granularity of analytical elements, from coarse (sketch-level) to fine (point-level), thereby ensuring more comprehensive coverage of the sketch information. For each level, we conducted theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations to identify and validate the effective information. Building on the above studies, we developed SDGraph, a deep learning architecture designed to exploit the identified effective information across the three levels. SDGraph comprises two complementary modules: a Sparse Graph that treats strokes as nodes for sketch-level and stroke-level representation learning, and a Dense Graph that treats points as nodes for sketch-level and point-level representation learning. Both modules employ graph convolution along with down-sampling and up-sampling operations, enabling them to function as both encoder and decoder. Besides that, an information fusion module bridges the two graphs to further enhance feature extraction. SDGraph supports a wide range of sketch-related downstream tasks, achieving accuracy improvements of 1.15\% and 1.70\% over the state-of-the-art in classification and retrieval, respectively, and 36.58\% improvement in vector sketch generation quality."
2510.13168,"Traditional integral wood joints, despite their strength, durability, and elegance, remain rare in modern workflows due to the cost and difficulty of manual fabrication. CNC milling offers a scalable alternative, but directly milling traditional joints often fails to produce functional results because milling induces geometric deviations, such as rounded inner corners, that alter the target geometries of the parts. Since joints rely on tightly fitting surfaces, such deviations introduce gaps or overlaps that undermine fit or block assembly. We propose to overcome this problem by (1) designing a language that represent millable geometry, and (2) co-optimizing part geometries to restore coupling. We introduce Millable Extrusion Geometry (MXG), a language for representing geometry as the outcome of milling operations performed with flat-end drill bits. MXG represents each operation as a subtractive extrusion volume defined by a tool direction and drill radius. This parameterization enables the modeling of artifact-free geometry under an idealized zero-radius drill bit, matching traditional joint designs. Increasing the radius then reveals milling-induced deviations, which compromise the integrity of the joint. To restore coupling, we formalize tight coupling in terms of both surface proximity and proximity constraints on the mill-bit paths associated with mating surfaces. We then derive two tractable, differentiable losses that enable efficient optimization of joint geometry. We evaluate our method on 30 traditional joint designs, demonstrating that it produces CNC-compatible, tightly fitting joints that approximates the original geometry. By reinterpreting traditional joints for CNC workflows, we continue the evolution of this heritage craft and help ensure its relevance in future making practices."
2510.13587,"We present HRM$^2$Avatar, a framework for creating high-fidelity avatars from monocular phone scans, which can be rendered and animated in real time on mobile devices. Monocular capture with smartphones provides a low-cost alternative to studio-grade multi-camera rigs, making avatar digitization accessible to non-expert users. Reconstructing high-fidelity avatars from single-view video sequences poses challenges due to limited visual and geometric data. To address these limitations, at the data level, our method leverages two types of data captured with smartphones: static pose sequences for texture reconstruction and dynamic motion sequences for learning pose-dependent deformations and lighting changes. At the representation level, we employ a lightweight yet expressive representation to reconstruct high-fidelity digital humans from sparse monocular data. We extract garment meshes from monocular data to model clothing deformations effectively, and attach illumination-aware Gaussians to the mesh surface, enabling high-fidelity rendering and capturing pose-dependent lighting. This representation efficiently learns high-resolution and dynamic information from monocular data, enabling the creation of detailed avatars. At the rendering level, real-time performance is critical for animating high-fidelity avatars in AR/VR, social gaming, and on-device creation. Our GPU-driven rendering pipeline delivers 120 FPS on mobile devices and 90 FPS on standalone VR devices at 2K resolution, over $2.7\times$ faster than representative mobile-engine baselines. Experiments show that HRM$^2$Avatar delivers superior visual realism and real-time interactivity, outperforming state-of-the-art monocular methods."

2510.14146,"Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability -- both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples. These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces. Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that learn on surfaces."
2510.15736,"Opaque objects reconstructed by 3DGS often exhibit a falsely transparent surface, leading to inconsistent background and internal patterns under camera motion in interactive viewing. This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization in 3DGS. During training, background and foreground Gaussians are blended via alpha-compositing and optimized solely against the input RGB images using a photometric loss. As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface opacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque regions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent. This issue is difficult to detect in standard evaluation settings but becomes particularly evident in object-centric reconstructions under interactive viewing. Although other causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false transparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this artifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages surface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians in the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to the existing splatting process. To quantitatively evaluate false transparency in static renderings, we propose a transmittance-based metric that measures the severity of this artifact. In addition, we introduce a customized, high-quality object-centric scan dataset exhibiting pronounced transparency issues, and we augment popular existing datasets with complementary infill noise specifically designed to assess the robustness of 3D reconstruction methods to false transparency. Experiments across multiple datasets show that NGS substantially reduces false transparency while maintaining competitive performance on standard rendering metrics, demonstrating its overall effectiveness."
2510.15873,"In this paper, we propose a two-stage sketch-based smoke illustration generation framework using stream function and latent diffusion models (LDM). The user sketch is used to guide the generation of the stream function, which serves as the control condition for the velocity field generator. The generated velocity field can be used to guide the smoke simulation to align with the intended flow. We adopt streamlines to encode global flow dynamics as sketch guidance during training. The stream function constitutes the intermediate representation that captures continuous variation and rotational flow details absent from sketches."
2510.15874,"Integrating motion into static images not only enhances visual expressiveness but also creates a sense of immersion and temporal depth, establishing it as a longstanding and impactful theme in artistic expression. Fluid elements such as waterfall, river, and oceans are common features in landscape, but their complex dynamic characteristics pose significant challenges in modeling and controlling their motion within visual computing. Physics-based methods are often used in fluid animation to track particle movement. However, they are easily affected by boundary conditions. Recently, latent diffusion models have been applied to video generation tasks, demonstrating impressive capabilities in producing high-quality and temporally coherent results. However, it is challenging for the existing methods to animate fluid smooth and temporally consistent motion. To solve these issues, this paper introduces a framework for generating landscape videos by animating fluid in still images under the guidance of motion sketches. We propose a finetuned conditional latent diffusion model for generating motion field from user-provided sketches, which are subsequently integrated into a latent video diffusion model via a motion adapter to precisely control the fluid movement."
2510.15876,"We propose an adaptive form of frameless rendering with the potential to dramatically increase rendering speed over conventional interactive rendering approaches. Without the rigid sampling patterns of framed renderers, sampling and reconstruction can adapt with very fine granularity to spatio-temporal color change. A sampler uses closed-loop feedback to guide sampling toward edges or motion in the image. Temporally deep buffers store all the samples created over a short time interval for use in reconstruction and as sampler feedback. GPU-based reconstruction responds both to sampling density and space-time color gradients. Where the displayed scene is static, spatial color change dominates and older samples are given significant weight in reconstruction, resulting in sharper and eventually antialiased images. Where the scene is dynamic, more recent samples are emphasized, resulting in less sharp but more up-to-date images. We also use sample reprojection to improve reconstruction and guide sampling toward occlusion edges, undersampled regions, and specular highlights. In simulation our frameless renderer requires an order of magnitude fewer samples than traditional rendering of similar visual quality (as measured by RMS error), while introducing overhead amounting to 15% of computation time."
2510.15877,"Cities are important elements of content in digital productions, but their complexity and size make them very challenging to model. Few tools exist that can help artists with this work, even as rapid improvements in graphics hardware create demand for richer content without matching increases in production cost. We propose a method for procedurally generating realistic patterns of land use in cities, automating placement of buildings and roads for artists."
2510.15886,"This paper introduces a method to extract a hierarchical tree representation from 3D unorganized polygonal data. The proposed approach first extracts a graph representation of the surface, which serves as the foundation for structural analysis. A Steiner tree is then generated to establish an optimized connection between key terminal points, defined according to application-specific criteria. The structure can be further refined by leveraging line-of-sight constraints, reducing redundancy while preserving essential connectivity. Unlike traditional skeletonization techniques, which often assume volumetric interpretations, this method operates directly on the surface, ensuring that the resulting representation remains relevant for navigation-aware geometric analysis. The method is validated through two use cases: extracting structural representations from tile-based elements for procedural content generation, and identifying key points and structural metrics for automated level analysis. Results demonstrate its ability to produce simplified, coherent representations, supporting applications in procedural generation, spatial reasoning, and map analysis."
2510.16147,"Synthesizing 3D scenes from open-vocabulary text descriptions is a challenging, important, and recently-popular application. One of its critical subproblems is layout generation: given a set of objects, lay them out to produce a scene matching the input description. Nearly all recent work adopts a declarative paradigm for this problem: using an LLM to generate a specification of constraints between objects, then solving those constraints to produce the final layout. In contrast, we explore an alternative imperative paradigm, in which an LLM iteratively places objects, with each object's position and orientation computed as a function of previously-placed objects. The imperative approach allows for a simpler scene specification language while also handling a wider variety and larger complexity of scenes. We further improve the robustness of our imperative scheme by developing an error correction mechanism that iteratively improves the scene's validity while staying as close as possible to the original layout generated by the LLM. In forced-choice perceptual studies, participants preferred layouts generated by our imperative approach 82% and 94% of the time when compared against two declarative layout generation methods. We also present a simple, automated evaluation metric for 3D scene layout generation that aligns well with human preferences."
2510.16486,"This paper presents a generalization of the Wasserstein distance for both persistence diagrams and merge trees [20], [66] that takes advantage of the regions of their topological features in the input domain. Specifically, we redefine the comparison of topological features as a distance between the values of their extrema-aligned regions. It results in a more discriminative metric than the classical Wasserstein distance and generalizes it through an input parameter adjusting the impact of the region properties in the distance. We present two strategies to control both computation time and memory storage of our method by respectively enabling the use of subsets of the regions in the computation, and by compressing the regions' properties to obtain low-memory representations. Extensive experiments on openly available ensemble data demonstrate the efficiency of our method, with running times on the orders of minutes on average. We show the utility of our contributions with two applications. First, we use the assignments between topological features provided by our method to track their evolution in time-varying ensembles and propose the temporal persistence curves to facilitate the understanding of how these features appear, disappear and change over time. Second, our method allows to compute a distance matrix of an ensemble that can be used for dimensionality reduction purposes and visually represent in 2D all its members, we show that such distance matrices also allow to detect key phases in the ensemble. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation that can be used to reproduce our results."
2510.16684,Let $f: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a scalar field. An isosurface is a piecewise linear approximation of a level set $f^{-1}(\sigma)$ for some $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}$ built from some regular grid sampling of $f$. Isosurfaces constructed from scanned data such as CT scans or MRIs often contain extremely small components that distract from the visualization and do not form part of any geometric model produced from the data. Simple prefiltering of the data can remove such small components while having no effect on the large components that form the body of the visualization. We present experimental results on such filtering.
2510.16966,"As simulations produce more data than available disk space on supercomputers, many simulations are employing in situ analysis and visualization to reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored. While in situ visualization offers potential for substantial data reduction, its efficacy is hindered by the need for a priori knowledge. First, we need to know what visualization parameters to use to highlight features of interest. Second, we do not know ahead of time how much resources will be needed to run the in situ workflows, e.g. how many compute nodes will be needed for in situ work. In this work, we present SeerX, a lightweight, scalable in-transit in situ service that supports dynamic resource allocation and lossy compression of 3D simulation data. SeerX enables multiple simulations to offload analysis to a shared, elastic service infrastructure without MPI synchronization."
2510.17101,"Human motion capture with sparse inertial sensors has gained significant attention recently. However, existing methods almost exclusively rely on a template adult body shape to model the training data, which poses challenges when generalizing to individuals with largely different body shapes (such as a child). This is primarily due to the variation in IMU-measured acceleration caused by changes in body shape. To fill this gap, we propose Shape-aware Inertial Poser (SAIP), the first solution considering body shape differences in sparse inertial-based motion capture. Specifically, we decompose the sensor measurements related to shape and pose in order to effectively model their joint correlations. Firstly, we train a regression model to transfer the IMU-measured accelerations of a real body to match the template adult body model, compensating for the shape-related sensor measurements. Then, we can easily follow the state-of-the-art methods to estimate the full body motions of the template-shaped body. Finally, we utilize a second regression model to map the joint velocities back to the real body, combined with a shape-aware physical optimization strategy to calculate global motions on the subject. Furthermore, our method relies on body shape awareness, introducing the first inertial shape estimation scheme. This is accomplished by modeling the shape-conditioned IMU-pose correlation using an MLP-based network. To validate the effectiveness of SAIP, we also present the first IMU motion capture dataset containing individuals of different body sizes. This dataset features 10 children and 10 adults, with heights ranging from 110 cm to 190 cm, and a total of 400 minutes of paired IMU-Motion samples. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SAIP can effectively handle motion capture tasks for diverse body shapes. The code and dataset are available atthis https URL."
2510.18189,"Global illumination (GI) is essential for realistic rendering but remains computationally expensive due to the complexity of simulating indirect light transport. Recent neural methods have mainly relied on per-scene optimization, sometimes extended to handle changes in camera or geometry. Efforts toward cross-scene generalization have largely stayed in 2D screen space, such as neural denoising or G-buffer based GI prediction, which often suffer from view inconsistency and limited spatial understanding. We propose a generalizable 3D light transport embedding that approximates global illumination directly from 3D scene configurations, without using rasterized or path-traced cues. Each scene is represented as a point cloud with geometric and material features. A scalable transformer models global point-to-point interactions to encode these features into neural primitives. At render time, each query point retrieves nearby primitives via nearest-neighbor search and aggregates their latent features through cross-attention to predict the desired rendering quantity. We demonstrate results on diffuse global illumination prediction across diverse indoor scenes with varying layouts, geometry, and materials. The embedding trained for irradiance estimation can be quickly adapted to new rendering tasks with limited fine-tuning. We also present preliminary results for spatial-directional radiance field estimation for glossy materials and show how the normalized field can accelerate unbiased path guiding. This approach highlights a path toward integrating learned priors into rendering pipelines without explicit ray-traced illumination cues."
2510.18278,"Analyzing origin-destination flows is an important problem that has been extensively investigated in several scientific fields, particularly by the visualization community. The problem becomes especially challenging when involving massive data, demanding mechanisms such as data aggregation and interactive filtering to make the exploratory process doable. However, data aggregation tends to smooth out certain patterns, and deciding which data should be filtered is not straightforward. In this work, we propose ORDENA, a visual analytic tool to explore origin and destination data. ORDENA is built upon a simple and intuitive scatter plot where the horizontal and vertical axes correspond to origins and destinations. Therefore, each origin-destination flow is represented as a point in the scatter plot. How the points are organized in the plot layout reveals important spatial phenomena present in the data. Moreover, ORDENA provides explainability resources that allow users to better understand the relation between origin-destination flows and associated attributes. We illustrate ORDENA's effectiveness in a set of case studies, which have also been elaborated in collaboration with domain experts. The proposed tool has also been evaluated by domain experts not involved in its development, which provided quite positive feedback about ORDENA."
2511.00702,"Doctors and researchers routinely use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography to visualize the fibrous structure of tissues in the human body. This paper explores the connection of these techniques to the painterly rendering of images. Using a tractography algorithm the presented method can place brush strokes that mimic the painting process of human artists, analogously to how fibres are tracked in DTI. The analogue to the diffusion tensor for image orientation is the structural tensor, which can provide better local orientation information than the gradient alone. I demonstrate this technique in portraits and general images, and discuss the parallels between fibre tracking and brush stroke placement, and frame it in the language of tractography. This work presents an exploratory investigation into the cross-domain application of diffusion tensor imaging techniques to painterly rendering of images. All the code is available atthis https URL"
2511.00898,"Large Language Models have emerged as a promising approach for graph learning due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However, existing methods exhibit systematic performance degradation on structurally important nodes such as bridges and hubs. We identify the root cause of these limitations. Current approaches encode graph topology into static features but lack reasoning scaffolds to transform topological patterns into role-based interpretations. This limitation becomes critical in zero-shot scenarios where no training data establishes structure-semantics mappings. To address this gap, we propose DuoGLM, a training-free dual-perspective framework for structure-aware graph reasoning. The local perspective constructs relation-aware templates capturing semantic interactions between nodes and neighbors. The global perspective performs topology-to-role inference to generate functional descriptions of structural positions. These complementary perspectives provide explicit reasoning mechanisms enabling LLMs to distinguish topologically similar but semantically different nodes. Extensive experiments across eight benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial improvements. DuoGLM achieves 14.3\% accuracy gain in zero-shot node classification and 7.6\% AUC improvement in cross-domain transfer compared to existing methods. The results validate the effectiveness of explicit role reasoning for graph understanding with LLMs."
2511.00911,"Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively integrate both structural topology and semantic content. Recent approaches apply large language models to graphs by linearizing structures into token sequences through random walks. These methods create concise graph vocabularies to replace verbose natural language descriptions. However, they overlook a critical component that makes language expressive: grammar. In natural language, grammar assigns syntactic roles to words and defines their functions within sentences. Similarly, nodes in graphs play distinct structural roles as hubs, bridges, or peripheral members. Current graph language methods provide tokens without grammatical annotations to indicate these structural or semantic roles. This absence limits language models' ability to reason about graph topology effectively. We propose \textbf{G2rammar}, a bilingual grammar framework that explicitly encodes both structural and semantic grammar for text-attributed graphs. Structural grammar characterizes topological roles through centrality and neighborhood patterns. Semantic grammar captures content relationships through textual informativity. The framework implements two-stage learning with structural grammar pre-training followed by semantic grammar fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that G2rammar consistently outperforms competitive baselines by providing language models with the grammatical context needed to understand graph structures."
2511.01259,"This paper presents a novel adjoint solver for differentiable fluid simulation based on bidirectional flow maps. Our key observation is that the forward fluid solver and its corresponding backward, adjoint solver share the same flow map as the forward simulation. In the forward pass, this map transports fluid impulse variables from the initial frame to the current frame to simulate vortical dynamics. In the backward pass, the same map propagates adjoint variables from the current frame back to the initial frame to compute gradients. This shared long-range map allows the accuracy of gradient computation to benefit directly from improvements in flow map construction. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel adjoint solver that solves the adjoint equations directly on the flow map, enabling long-range and accurate differentiation of incompressible flows without differentiating intermediate numerical steps or storing intermediate variables, as required in conventional adjoint methods. To further improve efficiency, we propose a long-short time-sparse flow map representation for evolving adjoint variables. Our approach has low memory usage, requiring only 6.53GB of data at a resolution of $192^3$ while preserving high accuracy in tracking vorticity, enabling new differentiable simulation tasks that require precise identification, prediction, and control of vortex dynamics."
2511.01894,"Recent advancements have demonstrated the great potential of flow matching-based Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in image editing. However, state-of-the-art works like BAGEL face limitations, including detail degradation, content inconsistency, and inefficiency due to their reliance on random noise initialization. To address these issues, we propose LGCC, a novel framework with two key components: Local Gaussian Noise Coupling (LGNC) and Content Consistency Loss (CCL). LGNC preserves spatial details by modeling target image embeddings and their locally perturbed counterparts as coupled pairs, while CCL ensures semantic alignment between edit instructions and image modifications, preventing unintended content removal. By integrating LGCC with the BAGEL pre-trained model via curriculum learning, we significantly reduce inference steps, improving local detail scores on I2EBench by 1.60% and overall scores by 0.53%. LGCC achieves 3x -- 5x speedup for lightweight editing and 2x for universal editing, requiring only 40% -- 50% of the inference time of BAGEL or Flux. These results demonstrate LGCC's ability to preserve detail, maintain contextual integrity, and enhance inference speed, offering a cost-efficient solution without compromising editing quality."
2511.03147,"Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have become a powerful representation for geometric reconstruction from point clouds, yet they often require both gradient- and curvature-based regularization to suppress spurious warp and preserve structural fidelity. FlatCAD introduced the Off-Diagonal Weingarten (ODW) loss as an efficient second-order prior for CAD surfaces, approximating full-Hessian regularization at roughly half the computational cost. However, FlatCAD applies a fixed ODW weight throughout training, which is suboptimal: strong regularization stabilizes early optimization but suppresses detail recovery in later stages. We present scheduling strategies for the ODW loss that assign a high initial weight to stabilize optimization and progressively decay it to permit fine-scale refinement. We investigate constant, linear, quintic, and step interpolation schedules, as well as an increasing warm-up variant. Experiments on the ABC CAD dataset demonstrate that time-varying schedules consistently outperform fixed weights. Our method achieves up to a 35% improvement in Chamfer Distance over the FlatCAD baseline, establishing scheduling as a simple yet effective extension of curvature regularization for robust CAD reconstruction."
2511.03617,"We evaluate how visualizations can influence the judgment of MLLMs about the presence or absence of bridges in a network. We show that the inclusion of visualization improves confidence over a structured text-based input that could theoretically be helpful for answering the question. On the other hand, we observe that standard visualization techniques create a strong bias towards accepting or refuting the presence of a bridge -- independently of whether or not a bridge actually exists in the network. While our results indicate that the inclusion of visualization techniques can effectively influence the MLLM's judgment without compromising its self-reported confidence, they also imply that practitioners must be careful of allowing users to include visualizations in generative AI applications so as to avoid undesired hallucinations."
2511.04025,"We introduce a compact yet highly expressive design space for shellular metamaterials. By employing only a few dozen degrees of freedom, this design space represents geometries ranging from simple planar configurations to complex triply periodic minimal surfaces. Coupled with this representation, we develop an efficient GPU-based homogenization pipeline that evaluates the structure in under 20 ms and computes the corresponding effective elastic tensor in near-real-time (0.5 s). The high speed of this evaluation facilitates an exhaustive exploration of the design space and supports an inverse-design scheme that tailors the shellular structure to specific macroscopic target property. Structures derived through this approach exhibit not only geometric diversity but also a wide spectrum of mechanical responses, covering a broad range of material properties. Moreover, they achieve up to 91.86% of theoretical upper bounds, a level of performance comparable to state-of-the-art shellular structures with low solid volume. Finally, our prototypes, fabricated via additive manufacturing, confirm the practical manufacturability of these designs, underscoring their potential for real-world engineering applications."
2511.0502,"Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a cross-modal task that aims to retrieve target images from large-scale databases using a reference image and a modification text. Most existing methods rely on a single model to perform feature fusion and similarity matching. However, this paradigm faces two major challenges. First, one model alone can't see the whole picture and the tiny details at the same time; it has to handle different tasks with the same weights, so it often misses the small but important links between image and text. Second, the absence of dynamic weight allocation prevents adaptive leveraging of complementary model strengths, so the resulting embedding drifts away from the target and misleads the nearest-neighbor search in CIR. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (DAFM) for multi-model collaboration in CIR. Rather than optimizing a single method in isolation, DAFM exploits the complementary strengths of heterogeneous models and adaptively rebalances their contributions. This not only maximizes retrieval accuracy but also ensures that the performance gains are independent of the fusion order, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Experiments on the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements. Our method achieves a Recall@10 of 93.21 and an Rmean of 84.43 on CIRR, and an average Rmean of 67.48 on FashionIQ, surpassing recent strong baselines by up to 4.5%. These results confirm that dynamic multi-model collaboration provides an effective and general solution for CIR."
2511.05109,"Geospatial sensor data is essential for modern defense and security, offering indispensable 3D information for situational awareness. This data, gathered from sources like lidar sensors and optical cameras, allows for the creation of detailed models of operational environments. In this paper, we provide a comparative analysis of traditional representation methods, such as point clouds, voxel grids, and triangle meshes, alongside modern neural and implicit techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our evaluation reveals a fundamental trade-off: traditional models offer robust geometric accuracy ideal for functional tasks like line-of-sight analysis and physics simulations, while modern methods excel at producing high-fidelity, photorealistic visuals but often lack geometric reliability. Based on these findings, we conclude that a hybrid approach is the most promising path forward. We propose a system architecture that combines a traditional mesh scaffold for geometric integrity with a neural representation like 3DGS for visual detail, managed within a hierarchical scene structure to ensure scalability and performance."
2511.0536,"We integrate smoothing B-splines into a standard differentiable vector graphics (DiffVG) pipeline through linear mapping, and show how this can be used to generate smooth and arbitrarily long paths within image-based deep learning systems. We take advantage of derivative-based smoothing costs for parametric control of fidelity vs. simplicity tradeoffs, while also enabling stylization control in geometric and image spaces. The proposed pipeline is compatible with recent vector graphics generation and vectorization methods. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach with four applications aimed at the generation of stylized vector graphics: stylized space-filling path generation, stroke-based image abstraction, closed-area image abstraction, and stylized text generation."
2511.06674,"Conventional topology learning methods for dynamical networks become inapplicable to processes exhibiting low-rank characteristics. To address this, we propose the low rank dynamical network model which ensures identifiability. By employing causal Wiener filtering, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition that links the sparsity pattern of the filter to conditional Granger causality. Building on this theoretical result, we develop a consistent method for estimating all network edges. Simulation results demonstrate the parsimony of the proposed framework and consistency of the topology estimation approach."
