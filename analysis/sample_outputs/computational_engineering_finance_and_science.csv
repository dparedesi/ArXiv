2501.00001,"In this paper, a mathematical model is developed to describe the evolution of the concentration of compounds through a gas chromatography column. The model couples mass balances and kinetic equations for all components. Both single and multiple-component cases are considered with constant or variable velocity. Non-dimensionalisation indicates the small effect of diffusion. The system where diffusion is neglected is analysed using Laplace transforms. In the multiple-component case, it is demonstrated that the competition between the compounds is negligible and the equations may be decoupled. This reduces the problem to solving a single integral equation to determine the concentration profile for all components (since they are scaled versions of each other). For a given analyte, we then only two parameters need to be fitted to the data. To verify this approach, the full governing equations are also solved numerically using the finite difference method and a global adaptive quadrature method to integrate the Laplace transformation. Comparison with the Laplace solution verifies the high degree of accuracy of the simpler Laplace form. The Laplace solution is then verified against experimental data from BTEX chromatography. This novel method, which involves solving a single equation and fitting parameters in pairs for individual components, is highly efficient. It is significantly faster and simpler than the full numerical solution and avoids the computationally expensive methods that would normally be used to fit all curves at the same time."
2501.00258,"In optimizing real-world structures, due to fabrication or budgetary restraints, the design variables may be restricted to a set of standard engineering choices. Such variables, commonly called categorical variables, are discrete and unordered in essence, precluding the utilization of gradient-based optimizers for the problems containing them. In this paper, incorporating the Gumbel-Softmax (GSM) method, we propose a new gradient-based optimizer for handling such variables in the optimal design of large-scale frame structures. The GSM method provides a means to draw differentiable samples from categorical distributions, thereby enabling sensitivity analysis for the variables generated from such distributions. The sensitivity information can greatly reduce the computational cost of traversing high-dimensional and discrete design spaces in comparison to employing gradient-free optimization methods. In addition, since the developed optimizer is gradient-based, it can naturally handle the simultaneous optimization of categorical and continuous design variables. Through three numerical case studies, different aspects of the proposed optimizer are studied and its advantages over population-based optimizers, specifically a genetic algorithm, are demonstrated."
2501.00267,"Heretofore, the Serret-Frenet frame has been the ubiquitous choice for analyzing the elastic deformations of beam elements. It is well known that this frame is undefined at the inflection points and straight segments of the beam where its curvature is zero, leading to singularities and errors in their numerical analysis. On the other hand, there exists a lesser-known frame called Bishop which does not have the caveats of the Serret-Frenet frame and is well-defined everywhere along the beam centerline. Leveraging the Bishop frame, in this paper, we propose a new spatial, singularity-free low-order beam element based on the absolute nodal coordinate formulation for both small and large deformation applications. This element, named ANCF14, has a constant mass matrix and can capture longitudinal, transverse (bending) and torsional deformations. It is a two-noded element with 7 degrees of freedom per node, which are global nodal coordinates, nodal slopes and their cross-sectional rotation about the centerline. The newly developed element is tested through four complex benchmarks. Comparing the ANCF14 results with theoretical and numerical results provided in other studies confirms the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed element."
2501.0031,"How to accurately quantify the uncertainty of stochastic dynamical responses affected by uncertain loads and structural parameters is an important issue in structural safety and reliability analysis. In this paper, the conditional uncertainty quantification analysis for the dynamical response of stochastic structures considering the measurement data with random error is studied in depth. A method for extracting the key measurement condition, which holds the most reference value for the uncertainty quantification of response, from the measurement data is proposed. Considering the key measurement condition and employing the principle of probability conservation and conditional probability theory, the quotient-form expressions for the conditional mean, conditional variance, and conditional probability density function of the stochastic structural dynamical response are derived and are referred to as the key conditional quotients (KCQ). A numerical method combining the non-equal weighted generalized Monte Carlo method, Dirac function smoothing technique, and online-offline coupled computational strategy is developed for calculating KCQs. Three linear/nonlinear stochastic dynamical examples are used to verify that the proposed KCQ method can efficiently and accurately quantify the uncertainty of the structural response considering measurement conditions. The examples also compare the traditional non-conditional uncertainty quantification results with the conditional uncertainty quantification results given by KCQs, indicating that considering measurement conditions can significantly reduce the uncertainty of the stochastic dynamical responses, providing a more refined statistical basis for structural safety and reliability analysis."
2501.00611,"This work proposes a gradient-based method to design bone implants using triply-periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) of spatially varying thickness to maximize bone in-growth. Bone growth into the implant is estimated using a finite element based mechanobiological model considering the magnitude and frequency of in vivo loads, as well as the density distribution of the surrounding bone. The wall thicknesses of the implant unit cells are determined via linear interpolation of the thicknesses over a user defined grid of control points, avoiding mesh dependency and providing control over the sensitivity computation costs. The TPMS structure is modeled as a homogenized material to reduce computational cost. Local properties of the implant are determined at run-time on an element-by-element basis using a pre-constructed surrogate model of the TPMS's physical and geometric properties as a function of the local wall thickness and the density of in-grown bone. Design sensitivities of the bone growth within the implant are computed using the direct sensitivity method. The methodology is demonstrated on a cementless hip, optimizing the implant for bone growth subject to wall thickness constraints to ensure manufacturability and allow cell infiltration."
2501.01859,"The modeling of deposition rates in Thermal Laser Epitaxy (TLE) is essential for the accurate prediction of the evaporation process and for improved dynamic process control. We demonstrate excellent agreement between experimental data and a model based on a finite element simulation that describes the temperature distribution of an elemental source when irradiated with continuous wave laser radiation. The simulation strongly depends on the thermophysical constants of the material, data of which is lacking for many elements. Effective values for the parameters may be determined with precision by means of an unambiguous reference provided by the melting point of the material, which is directly observed during the experiments. TLE may therefore be used to study the high temperature thermophysical and optical properties of the elements."
2501.02077,"This paper presents a computationally efficient method for the optimal design of silica aerogel porous material systems, balancing thermal insulation performance with mechanical stability under stress concentrations. The proposed approach explicitly accounts for additive manufacturing uncertainties by modeling material porosity as a spatially correlated stochastic field within a multiphase finite element formulation. A risk-averse objective function, incorporating statistical moments of the design objective, is employed in conjunction with chance constraints that enforce mechanical stability by restricting the probability of exceeding critical stress thresholds. To mitigate the prohibitively high computational cost associated with the large-dimensional uncertainty space and Monte Carlo estimations of the objective function's statistical moments, a second-order Taylor expansion is utilized as a control variate. Furthermore, a continuation-based smoothing strategy is introduced to address the non-differentiability of the chance constraints, ensuring compatibility with gradient-based optimization. The resulting framework achieves computational scalability, remaining agnostic to the dimensionality of the stochastic design space. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional thermal break systems for building insulation. The results highlight the framework's capability to solve large-scale, chance-constrained optimal design problems governed by finite element models with uncertain design parameter spaces reaching dimensions in the hundreds of thousands."
2501.0267,"We apply physics-augmented neural network (PANN) constitutive models to experimental uniaxial tensile data of rubber-like materials whose behavior depends on manufacturing parameters. For this, we conduct experimental investigations on a 3D printed digital material at different mix ratios and consider several datasets from literature, including Ecoflex at different Shore hardness and a photocured 3D printing material at different grayscale values. We introduce a parametrized hyperelastic PANN model which can represent material behavior at different manufacturing parameters. The proposed model fulfills common mechanical conditions of hyperelasticity. In addition, the hyperelastic potential of the proposed model is monotonic in isotropic isochoric strain invariants of the right Cauchy-Green tensor. In incompressible hyperelasticity, this is a relaxed version of the ellipticity (or rank-one convexity) condition. Using this relaxed ellipticity condition, the PANN model has enough flexibility to be applicable to a wide range of materials while having enough structure for a stable extrapolation outside the calibration data. The monotonic PANN yields excellent results for all materials studied and can represent a wide range of largely varying qualitative and quantitative stress behavior. Although calibrated on uniaxial tensile data only, it leads to a stable numerical behavior of 3D finite element simulations. The findings of our work suggest that monotonicity could play a key role in the formulation of very general yet robust and stable constitutive models applicable to materials with highly nonlinear and parametrized behavior."
2501.0276,"Link prediction in heterogeneous networks is crucial for understanding the intricacies of network structures and forecasting their future developments. Traditional methodologies often face significant obstacles, including over-smoothing-wherein the excessive aggregation of node features leads to the loss of critical structural details-and a dependency on human-defined meta-paths, which necessitate extensive domain knowledge and can be inherently restrictive. These limitations hinder the effective prediction and analysis of complex heterogeneous networks. In response to these challenges, we propose the Contrastive Heterogeneous grAph Transformer (CHAT). CHAT introduces a novel sampling-based graph transformer technique that selectively retains nodes of interest, thereby obviating the need for predefined meta-paths. The method employs an innovative connection-aware transformer to encode node sequences and their interconnections with high fidelity, guided by a dual-faceted loss function specifically designed for heterogeneous network link prediction. Additionally, CHAT incorporates an ensemble link predictor that synthesizes multiple samplings to achieve enhanced prediction accuracy. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of CHAT using three distinct drug-target interaction (DTI) datasets. The empirical results underscore CHAT's superior performance, outperforming both general-task approaches and models specialized in DTI prediction. These findings substantiate the efficacy of CHAT in addressing the complex problem of link prediction in heterogeneous networks."
2501.02941,"Free surface and granular fluid mechanics problems combine the challenges of fluid dynamics with aspects of granular behaviour. This type of problem is particularly relevant in contexts such as the flow of sediments in rivers, the movement of granular soils in reservoirs, or the interactions between a fluid and granular materials in industrial processes such as silos. The numerical simulation of these phenomena is challenging because the solution depends not only on the multiple phases that strongly interact with each other, but also on the need to describe the geometric evolution of the different interfaces. This paper presents an approach to the simulation of fluid-granular phenomena involving strongly deforming free surfaces. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is combined with the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) and the fluid-grain interface is treated by a two-way coupling between the two phases. The fluid-air interface is solved by a free surface model. The geometric and topological variations are therefore naturally provided by the full Lagrangian description of all phases. The approach is validated on benchmark test cases such as two-phase dam failures and then applied to a real landslide problem."
2501.03068,"We introduce the Stress-Guided Lightweight Design Benchmark (SGLDBench), a comprehensive benchmark suite for applying and evaluating material layout strategies to generate stiff, lightweight designs in 3D domains. SGLDBench provides a seamlessly integrated simulation and analysis framework, including six reference strategies and a scalable multigrid elasticity solver to efficiently execute these strategies and validate the stiffness of their results. This facilitates the systematic analysis and comparison of design strategies based on the mechanical properties they achieve. SGLDBench enables the evaluation of diverse load conditions and, through the tight integration of the solver, supports high-resolution designs and stiffness analysis. Additionally, SGLDBench emphasizes visual analysis to explore the relationship between the geometric structure of a design and the distribution of stresses, offering insights into the specific properties and behaviors of different design strategies. SGLDBench's specific features are highlighted through several experiments, comparing the results of reference strategies with respect to geometric and mechanical properties."
2501.0316,"Anisotropic X-ray Dark-Field Tomography (AXDT) is a novel imaging technology that enables the extraction of fiber structures on the micrometer scale, far smaller than standard X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) setups. Directional and structural information is relevant in medical diagnostics and material testing. Compared to existing solutions, AXDT could prove a viable alternative. Reconstruction methods in AXDT have so far been driven by practicality. Improved methods could make AXDT more accessible. We contribute numerically stable implementations and validation of advanced statistical reconstruction methods that incorporate the statistical noise behavior of the imaging system. We further provide a new statistical reconstruction formulation that retains the advanced noise assumptions of the imaging setup while being efficient and easy to optimize. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the optimization behavior for all models regarding AXDT. Our experiments show that statistical reconstruction outperforms the previously used model, and particularly the noise performance is superior. While the previously proposed statistical method is effective, it is computationally expensive, and our newly proposed formulation proves highly efficient with identical performance. Our theoretical analysis opens the possibility to new and more advanced reconstruction algorithms, which in turn enable future research in AXDT."
2501.03854,"Using an interface inserted in a background mesh is an alternative way of constructing a complex geometrical shape with a relative low meshing efforts. However, this process may require special treatment of elements cut by the interface. Our study focuses on comparing the integration of cut elements defined by implicit and parametric curves. We investigate the efficiency and robustness of open-source tools such as Algoim [5](a library for quadrature on implicitly defined geometries) and Ginkgo [2](a library for isogeometric analysis on Boolean operations with a parametric description) with numerical examples computing the area defined by the interface and benchmarks for 2D elasticity problem using the open-source code GeoPDEs [7]. It is concluded that none of the two interface descriptions is preferable with respect to the quality of the integration. Thus, the choice of the interface type depends only on the studied problem and the available curve description, but not on the numerical aspects of the integration."
2501.03964,"Wind gusts, being inherently stochastic, can significantly influence the safety and performance of aircraft. This study investigates a three-dimensional uncertainty quantification (UQ) problem to explore how uncertainties in gust and flight conditions affect the structural response of a Lift-Plus-Cruise eVTOL aircraft wing. The analysis employs an unsteady aeroelastic model with a one-way coupling between a panel method aerodynamic solver and a shell analysis structural solver to predict the wing's response under varying conditions. Additionally, this paper presents a comparative evaluation of commonly used non-intrusive UQ methods, including non-intrusive polynomial chaos, kriging, Monte Carlo, univariate dimension reduction, and gradient-enhanced univariate dimension reduction. These methods are assessed based on their effectiveness in estimating various risk measures-mean, standard deviation, and 95th percentile-of critical structural response outputs such as maximum tip displacement and average strain energy. The numerical results reveal significant variability in the structural response outputs, even under relatively small ranges of uncertain inputs. This highlights the sensitivity of the system to uncertainties in gust and flight conditions. Furthermore, the performance of the implemented UQ methods varies significantly depending on the specific risk measures and the quantity of interest being analyzed."
2501.0434,"The simulation of three dimensional magnetostatic problems plays an important role, for example when simulating synchronous electric machines. Building on prior work that developed a domain decomposition algorithm using isogeometric analysis, this paper extends the method to support subdomains composed of multiple patches. This extension enables load-balancing across available CPUs, facilitated by graph partitioning tools such as METIS. The proposed approach enhances scalability and flexibility, making it suitable for large-scale simulations in diverse industrial contexts."
2501.04584,"This paper proposes a new approach for the calibration of material parameters in local elastoplastic constitutive models. The calibration is posed as a constrained optimization problem, where the constitutive model evolution equations for a single material point serve as constraints. The objective function quantifies the mismatch between the stress predicted by the model and corresponding experimental measurements. To improve calibration efficiency, a novel direct-adjoint approach is presented to compute the Hessian of the objective function, which enables the use of second-order optimization algorithms. Automatic differentiation is used for gradient and Hessian computations. Two numerical examples are employed to validate the Hessian matrices and to demonstrate that the Newton-Raphson algorithm consistently outperforms gradient-based algorithms such as L-BFGS-B."
2501.04855,"This paper presents a general non-linear computational formulation for rotation-free thin shells based on isogeometric finite elements. It is a displacement-based formulation that admits general material models. The formulation allows for a wide range of constitutive laws, including both shell models that are extracted from existing 3D continua using numerical integration and those that are directly formulated in 2D manifold form, like the Koiter, Canham and Helfrich models. Further, a unified approach to enforce the $G^1$-continuity between patches, fix the angle between surface folds, enforce symmetry conditions and prescribe rotational Dirichlet boundary conditions, is presented using penalty and Lagrange multiplier methods. The formulation is fully described in the natural curvilinear coordinate system of the finite element description, which facilitates an efficient computational implementation. It contains existing isogeometric thin shell formulations as special cases. Several classical numerical benchmark examples are considered to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed formulation. The presented constitutive models, in particular the simple mixed Koiter model that does not require any thickness integration, show excellent performance, even for large deformations."
2501.05162,"This paper proposes a novel and efficient key conditional quotient filter (KCQF) for the estimation of state in the nonlinear system which can be either Gaussian or non-Gaussian, and either Markovian or non-Markovian. The core idea of the proposed KCQF is that only the key measurement conditions, rather than all measurement conditions, should be used to estimate the state. Based on key measurement conditions, the quotient-form analytical integral expressions for the conditional probability density function, mean, and variance of state are derived by using the principle of probability conservation, and are calculated by using the Monte Carlo method, which thereby constructs the KCQF. Two nonlinear numerical examples were given to demonstrate the superior estimation accuracy of KCQF, compared to seven existing filters."
2501.05168,"Kabaddi, a contact team sport of Indian origin, has seen a dramatic rise in global popularity, highlighted by the upcoming Kabaddi World Cup in 2025 with over sixteen international teams participating, alongside flourishing national leagues such as the Indian Pro Kabaddi League (230 million viewers) and the British Kabaddi League. We present the first open-source Python module to make Kabaddi statistical data easily accessible from multiple scattered sources across the internet. The module was developed by systematically web-scraping and collecting team-wise, player-wise and match-by-match data. The data has been cleaned, organized, and categorized into team overviews and player metrics, each filterable by season. The players are classified as raiders and defenders, with their best strategies for attacking, counter-attacking, and defending against different teams highlighted. Our module enables continuous monitoring of exponentially growing data streams, aiding researchers to quickly start building upon the data to answer critical questions, such as the impact of player inclusion/exclusion on team performance, scoring patterns against specific teams, and break down opponent gameplay. The data generated from Kabaddi tournaments has been sparsely used, and coaches and players rely heavily on intuition to make decisions and craft strategies. Our module can be utilized to build predictive models, craft uniquely strategic gameplays to target opponents and identify hidden correlations in the data. This open source module has the potential to increase time-efficiency, encourage analytical studies of Kabaddi gameplay and player dynamics and foster reproducible research. The data and code are publicly available:this https URL"
2501.05225,"In systems with slow reaction kinetics, such as mineral dissolution processes, chemical equilibrium cannot be assumed and an accurate understanding of reaction rates is essential; discrepancies in parameter reporting can greatly affect simulation results. This technical note identifies an issue with the reporting of rate parameters for carbonate mineral dissolution in a widely used database for reactive transport modeling based on Palandri and Kharaka 2004. This misrepresentation leads to a considerable overestimation of reaction timescales. Using the simulators Reaktoro and DuMuX, we simulated a simple calcite dissolution batch test and compared the results to experimental data. By adjusting the parameter to align with established literature, we demonstrate an improved fit between simulated and experimental data. Discrepancies in reaction timescales were reduced by an order of magnitude, emphasizing the importance of regular validation of simulations with experimental data."
2501.053,"The discrete element method (DEM) is a powerful tool for simulating granular soils, but its high computational demand often results in extended simulation times. While the effect of particle size has been extensively studied, the potential benefits of spatially scaling particle sizes are less explored. We systematically investigate a local particle refinement method's impact on reducing computational effort while maintaining accuracy. We first conduct triaxial tests to verify that bulk mechanical properties are preserved under local particle refinement. Then, we perform pressure-sinkage and shear-displacement tests, comparing our method to control simulations with homogeneous particle size. We evaluate $36$ different DEM beds with varying aggressiveness in particle refinement. Our results show that this approach, depending on refinement aggressiveness, can significantly reduce particle count by $2.3$ to $25$ times and simulation times by $3.1$ to $43$ times, with normalized errors ranging from $3.4$\% to $11$\% compared to high-resolution reference simulations. The approach maintains a high resolution at the soil surface, where interaction is high, while allowing larger particles below the surface. The results demonstrate that substantial computational savings can be achieved without significantly compromising simulation accuracy. This method can enhance the efficiency of DEM simulations in terramechanics applications."
2501.05848,"Local refinement is vital for efficient numerical simulations. In the context of Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), hierarchical B-splines have gained prominence. The work applies the methodology of truncated hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines) as they keep additional properties. The framework is further enriched with Bézier extraction, resulting in the multi-level Bézier extraction method. We apply this discretization method to 2D magnetostatic problems. The implementation is based on an open-source Octave/MATLAB IGA code called GeoPDEs, which allows us to compare our routines with globally refined spline models as well as locally refined ones where the solver does not rely on Bézier extraction."
2501.06583,"Wheel loaders in mines and construction sites repeatedly load soil from a pile to load receivers. Automating this task presents a challenging planning problem since each loading's performance depends on the pile state, which depends on previous loadings. We investigate an end-to-end optimization approach considering future loading outcomes and transportation costs between the pile and load receivers. To predict the evolution of the pile state and the loading performance, we use world models that leverage deep neural networks trained on numerous simulated loading cycles. A look-ahead tree search optimizes the sequence of loading actions by evaluating the performance of thousands of action candidates, which expand into subsequent action candidates under the predicted pile states recursively. Test results demonstrate that, over a horizon of 15 sequential loadings, the look-ahead tree search is 6% more efficient than a greedy strategy, which always selects the action that maximizes the current single loading performance, and 14% more efficient than using a fixed loading controller optimized for the nominal case."
2501.06879,"This study proposes an advanced method for surface defect detection in printed circuit boards (PCBs) using an improved YOLOv11 model enhanced with a generative adversarial network (GAN). The approach focuses on identifying six common defect types: missing hole, rat bite, open circuit, short circuit, burr, and virtual welding. By employing GAN to generate synthetic defect images, the dataset is augmented with diverse and realistic patterns, improving the model's ability to generalize, particularly for complex and infrequent defects like burrs. The enhanced YOLOv11 model is evaluated on a PCB defect dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy, recall, and robustness, especially when dealing with defects in complex environments or small targets. This research contributes to the broader field of electronic design automation (EDA), where efficient defect detection is a crucial step in ensuring high-quality PCB manufacturing. By integrating advanced deep learning techniques, this approach enhances the automation and precision of defect detection, reducing reliance on manual inspection and accelerating design-to-production workflows. The findings underscore the importance of incorporating GAN-based data augmentation and optimized detection architectures in EDA processes, providing valuable insights for improving reliability and efficiency in PCB defect detection within industrial applications."
2501.06988,"Accurately predicting wave-structure interactions is critical for the effective design and analysis of marine structures. This is typically achieved using solvers that employ the boundary element method (BEM), which relies on linear potential flow theory. Precise estimation of the sensitivity of these interactions is equally important for system-level applications such as design optimization. Current BEM solvers are unable to provide these sensitivities as they do not support automatic differentiation (AD). To address these challenges, we have developed a fully differentiable BEM solver"
2501.07121,"Grid-scale battery energy storage systems (BESSs) can provide flexibility to the power system and capture shortterm price volatility by shifting energy in time through controlled charging and discharging. The highly volatile European continuous intraday (CID) market allows trading until just a few minutes before physical delivery, offering significant earning potential. However, its high trading frequency poses substantial modeling challenges. Accurate modeling of BESSs trading in the CID market is essential to estimate revenue potential and optimize trading strategies. Additionally, comparing CID profits with other spot markets helps determine whether participating in the CID is worthwhile despite its complexity. We propose a forecast-driven model to optimize BESS trading in the CID market. Our strategy employs a rolling window modeling framework to capture market dynamics. Price forecasts for impending CID products are generated at the beginning of each window and used to optimize trading schedules for subsequent execution. We also benchmark our approach across various spot markets, offering a broad cross-market profit comparison. We evaluate our forecast-driven model across different BESS power-to-capacity ratios, comparing it to a perfect-foresight scenario and key CID market indices, such as ID1 and ID3. Using real 2023 German CID data, a 1 MW/1 MWh system adopting our method earns EUR 146 237, only 11% below perfect foresight, surpassing all other markets and indices. Our approach surpasses ID1 and ID3 by over 4% and 32%, respectively, confirming ID1 as a reliable lower-bound estimate for earnings potential in the CID market."
2501.07274,"Traditional risk factors like beta, size/value, and momentum often lag behind market dynamics in measuring and predicting stock return volatility. Statistical models like PCA and factor analysis fail to capture hidden nonlinear relationships. Genetic programming (GP) can identify nonlinear factors but often lacks mechanisms for evaluating factor quality, and the resulting formulas are complex. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (HPPO) framework for automated factor generation and evaluation. HPPO uses two PPO models: a high-level policy assigns weights to stock features, and a low-level policy identifies latent nonlinear relationships. The Pearson correlation between generated factors and return volatility serves as the reward signal. Transfer learning pre-trains the high-level policy on large-scale historical data, fine-tuning it with the latest data to adapt to new features and shifts. Experiments show the HPPO-TO algorithm achieves a 25\% excess return in HFT markets across China (CSI 300/800), India (Nifty 100), and the US (S\&P 500). Code and data are available atthis https URL."
2501.07701,"Surrogate models are effective tools for accelerated design of complex systems. The result of a design optimization procedure using surrogate models can be used to initialize an optimization routine using the full order system. High accuracy of the surrogate model can be advantageous for fast convergence. In this work, we present an active learning approach to produce a very high accuracy surrogate model of a turbofan jet engine, that demonstrates 0.1\% relative error for all quantities of interest. We contrast this with a surrogate model produced using a more traditional brute-force data generation approach."
2501.08314,"Efficient and accurate learning of constitutive laws is crucial for accurately predicting the mechanical behavior of materials under complex loading conditions. Accurate model calibration hinges on a delicate interplay between the information embedded in experimental data and the parameters that define our constitutivethis http URLinformation encoded in the parameters of the constitutive model must be complemented by the information in the data used for calibration. This interplay raises fundamental questions: How can we quantify the information content of test data? How much information does a single test convey? Also, how much information is required to accurately learn a constitutive model? To address these questions, we introduce mechanics informatics, a paradigm for efficient and accurate constitutive model learning. At its core is the stress state entropy, a metric for quantifying the information content of experimental data. Using this framework, we analyzed specimen geometries with varying information content for learning an anisotropic inelastic law. Specimens with limited information enabled accurate identification of a few parameters sensitive to the information in the data. Furthermore, we optimized specimen design by incorporating stress state entropy into a Bayesian optimization scheme. This led to the design of cruciform specimens with maximized entropy for accurate parameter identification. Conversely, minimizing entropy in Peirs shear specimens yielded a uniform shear stress state, showcasing the framework's flexibility in tailoring designs for specific experimental goals. Finally, we addressed experimental uncertainties, demonstrated the potential of transfer learning for replacing challenging testing protocols with simpler alternatives, and extension of the framework to different material laws."
2501.08528,"With the development of deep learning, Dynamic Portfolio Optimization (DPO) problem has received a lot of attention in recent years, not only in the field of finance but also in the field of deep learning. Some advanced research in recent years has proposed the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to the DPO problem, which demonstrated to be more advantageous than supervised learning in solving the DPO problem. However, there are still certain unsolved issues: 1) DRL algorithms usually have the problems of slow learning speed and high sample complexity, which is especially problematic when dealing with complex financial data. 2) researchers use DRL simply for the purpose of obtaining high returns, but pay little attention to the problem of risk control and trading strategy, which will affect the stability of model returns. In order to address these issues, in this study we revamped the intrinsic structure of the model based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and proposed the Augmented DDPG model. Besides, we also proposed an innovative risk control strategy based on Quantum Price Levels (QPLs) derived from Quantum Finance Theory (QFT). Our experimental results revealed that our model has better profitability as well as risk control ability with less sample complexity in the DPO problem compared to the baseline models."
2501.08539,"Accurate stock price prediction is crucial for investors and financial institutions, yet the complexity of the stock market makes it highly challenging. This study aims to construct an effective model to enhance the prediction ability of General Electric's stock price trend. The CNN - LSTM model is adopted, combining the feature extraction ability of CNN with the long - term dependency handling ability of LSTM, and the Adam optimizer is used to adjust the parameters. In the data preparation stage, historical trading data of General Electric's stock is collected. After cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering, features with strong correlations to the closing price are selected and dimensionality reduction is performed. During model training, the data is divided into training, validation, and testing sets in a ratio of 7:2:1. The Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm is used with a dynamic learning rate adjustment and L2 regularization, and the Mean Squared Error is used as the loss function, evaluated by variance, R - squared score, and maximum error. Experimental results show that the model loss decreases steadily, and the predicted values align well with the actual values, providing a powerful tool for investment decisions. However, the model's performance in real - time and extreme market conditions remains to be tested, and future improvements could consider incorporating more data sources."
2501.08795,"Maintaining a comfortable temperature inside a building requires appropriate thermal insulation of windows, which can be optimised iteratively with numerical simulation. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics(SPH) is a fully Lagrangian method widely used for simulating multi-physics applications with high computational efficiency and accuracy. It is advantageous in physically coupled problems such as heat-fluid-solid or any other type of physically coupled simulations. The focus of this study is to simulate the heat transfer process in various window frames under convective boundary conditions according to ISO10077-2:2012. This paper demonstrates the accuracy and compatibility of SPH when dealing with heat transfer problems, which ensures further development of thermal coupling with other physical fields. The results and methods used in this paper provide some guidance on how to properly handle heat transfer simulations using SPH, which can be extended to multi-physics coupled simulations in the future."
2501.10185,"The present work addresses the simulation of pore emptying during the drying of battery electrodes. For this purpose, a model based on the multiphase-field method (MPF) is used, since it is an established approach for modeling and simulating multiphysical problems. A model based on phase fields is introduced that takes into account fluid flow, capillary effects, and wetting behavior, all of which play an important role in drying. In addition, the MPF makes it possible to track the movement of the liquid-air interface without computationally expensive adaptive mesh generation. The presented model is used for the first time to investigate pore emptying in real hard carbon microstructures. For this purpose, the microstructures of real dried electrodes are used as input for the simulations. The simulations performed here demonstrate the importance of considering the resolved microstructural information compared to models that rely only on statistical geometry parameters such as pore size distributions. The influence of various parameters such as different microstructures, fluid viscosity, and the contact angle on pore emptying are investigated. In addition, this work establishes a correlation between the capillary number and the breakthrough time of the solvent as well as the height difference of the solvent front at the time of breakthrough. The results indicate that the drying process can be optimized by doping the particle surface, which changes the contact angle between the fluids and the particles."
2501.10282,"Considering the significance of proteins, computational protein science has always been a critical scientific field, dedicated to revealing knowledge and developing applications within the protein sequence-structure-function paradigm. In the last few decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant impacts in computational protein science, leading to notable successes in specific protein modeling tasks. However, those previous AI models still meet limitations, such as the difficulty in comprehending the semantics of protein sequences, and the inability to generalize across a wide range of protein modeling tasks. Recently, LLMs have emerged as a milestone in AI due to their unprecedented language processing & generalization capability. They can promote comprehensive progress in fields rather than solving individual tasks. As a result, researchers have actively introduced LLM techniques in computational protein science, developing protein Language Models (pLMs) that skillfully grasp the foundational knowledge of proteins and can be effectively generalized to solve a diversity of sequence-structure-function reasoning problems. While witnessing prosperous developments, it's necessary to present a systematic overview of computational protein science empowered by LLM techniques. First, we summarize existing pLMs into categories based on their mastered protein knowledge, i.e., underlying sequence patterns, explicit structural and functional information, and external scientific languages. Second, we introduce the utilization and adaptation of pLMs, highlighting their remarkable achievements in promoting protein structure prediction, protein function prediction, and protein design studies. Then, we describe the practical application of pLMs in antibody design, enzyme design, and drug discovery. Finally, we specifically discuss the promising future directions in this fast-growing field."
2501.10709,"Reinforcement learning has demonstrated great potential for performing financial tasks. However, it faces two major challenges: policy instability and sampling bottlenecks. In this paper, we revisit ensemble methods with massively parallel simulations on graphics processing units (GPUs), significantly enhancing the computational efficiency and robustness of trained models in volatile financial markets. Our approach leverages the parallel processing capability of GPUs to significantly improve the sampling speed for training ensemble models. The ensemble models combine the strengths of component agents to improve the robustness of financial decision-making strategies. We conduct experiments in both stock and cryptocurrency trading tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Massively parallel simulation on a single GPU improves the sampling speed by up to $1,746\times$ using $2,048$ parallel environments compared to a single environment. The ensemble models have high cumulative returns and outperform some individual agents, reducing maximum drawdown by up to $4.17\%$ and improving the Sharpe ratio by up to $0.21$.This paper describes trading tasks at ACM ICAIF FinRL Contests in 2023 and 2024."
2501.10808,"In today's financial markets, quantitative trading has become an essential trading method, with the MACD indicator widely employed in quantitative trading strategies. This paper begins by screening and cleaning the dataset, establishing a model that adheres to the basic buy and sell rules of the MACD, and calculating key metrics such as the win rate, return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown for each stock. However, the MACD often generates erroneous signals in highly volatile markets. To address this, wavelet transform is applied to reduce noise, smoothing the DIF image, and a model is developed based on this to optimize the identification of buy and sell points. The results show that the annualized return has increased by 5%, verifying the feasibility of the method.Subsequently, the divergence principle is used to further optimize the trading strategy, enhancing the model's performance. Additionally, a genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the MACD parameters, tailoring the strategy to the characteristics of different stocks. To improve computational efficiency, the MindSpore framework is used for resource management and parallel computing. The optimized strategy demonstrates improved win rates, returns, Sharpe ratios, and a reduction in maximum drawdown in backtesting."
2501.10825,"Estimating the material properties of thermal protection films is crucial for their effective design and application, particularly in high-temperature environments. This work presents a novel approach to determine the properties using uncertainty quantification simulations. We quantify uncertainty in the material properties for effective insulation by proposing a Bayesian distribution for them. Sampling from this distribution is performed using Monte Carlo simulations, which require repeatedly solving the predictive thermal model. To address the computational inefficiency of conventional numerical simulations, we develop a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve the heat transfer problem. The proposed PINN significantly reduces computational time while maintaining accuracy, as verified against traditional numerical solutions. Additionally, we used the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method to enable vectorized and parallel computations, further enhancing computational speedup. Our results demonstrate that integrating MCMC with PINN decreases computational time substantially compared to using standard numerical methods. Moreover, combining the SMC method with PINN yields multifold computational speedup, making this approach highly effective for the rapid and accurate estimation of material properties."

This historic blackout caused widespread power disruptions across the Houston metropolitan area, leaving more than 2 million customers without power over several days, resulting in more than 143 million total customer-outthis http URLfindings reveal that areas with higher population density and proximity to the hurricane's path experienced more severe initial impacts. Regions with higher median income showed faster recovery, while lower-income areas exhibited prolonged restoration periods, even with favorable infrastructural conditions, suggesting disparities in restoration speed. The study also highlights how urban development features, such as road density and land elevation, explain spatial disparities in power outage impacts and recovery. This research advances the understanding of power outage dynamics in large metropolitan regions through four key contributions: (1) empirical characterization of outages from a historic hurricane, highlighting infrastructure vulnerabilities in a high-density urban context; (2) comprehensive analysis using multiple metrics to capture spatiotemporal dynamics of outages and restoration; (3) leveraging of high-resolution outage data at fine geographic scales and frequent intervals to quantify and reveal previously masked spatial disparities; and (4) systematic examination of socioeconomic, urban development, and environmental factors in shaping disparities in outage impacts and recovery timelines. These findings provide infrastructure managers, operators, utilities, and decision-makers with crucial empirical insights to quantify power outage impacts, justify resilience investments, and address vulnerability and equity issues in the power infrastructure during hazard events."

Effective strategies are needed to manage traffic volumes and reduce emissions. In practice, traditional traffic flow simulations are used to test those strategies. However, high computational intensity usually limits their applicability in investigating a magnitude of different scenarios to evaluate best policies.

In a case study using the MATSim model of Paris, the GNN effectively learned the impacts of capacity reduction policies on citywide traffic flow. Performance analysis across various road types and scenarios revealed that the GNN could accurately capture policy-induced effects on edge-based traffic volumes, particularly on roads directly affected by the policies and those with higher traffic volumes."
2501.1113,"This study proposes a new full-field approach for modeling grain boundary pinning by second phase particles in two-dimensional polycrystals. These particles are of great importance during thermomechanical treatments, as they produce deviations from the microstructural evolution that the alloy produces in the absence of particles. This phenomenon, well-known as Smith-Zener pinning, is widely used by metallurgists to control the grain size during the metal forming process of many alloys. Predictive tools are then needed to accurately model this phenomenon. This article introduces a new methodology for the simulation of microstructural evolutions subjected to the presence of second phase particles. The methodology employs a Lagrangian 2D front-tracking methodology, while the particles are modeled using discretized circular shapes or pinning nodes. The evolution of the particles can be considered and modeled using a constant velocity of particle shrinking. This approach has the advantages of improving the limited description made of the phenomenon in vertex approaches, to be usable for a wide range of second-phase particle sizes and to improve calculation times compared to front-capturing type approaches."

2501.11416,"Cryptocurrencies have recently been in the spotlight of public debate due to their embrace by the new US President, with crypto fans expecting a 'bull run'. The global cryptocurrency market capitalisation is more than \$3.50 trillion, with 1 Bitcoin exchanging for more than \$97,000 at the end of November 2024. Monitoring the evolution of these systems is key to understanding whether the popular perception of cryptocurrencies as a new, sustainable economic infrastructure is well-founded. In this paper, we have reconstructed the network structures and dynamics of Bitcoin from its launch in January 2009 to December 2023 and identified its key evolutionary phases. Our results show that network centralisation and wealth concentration increased from the very early years, following a richer-get-richer mechanism. This trend was endogenous to the system, beyond any subsequent institutional or exogenous influence. The evolution of Bitcoin is characterised by three periods, Exploration, Adaptation and Maturity, with substantial coherent network patterns. Our findings suggest that Bitcoin is a highly centralised structure, with high levels of wealth inequality and internally crystallised power dynamics, which may have negative implications for its long-term sustainability."

2501.1204,"Vehicle-to-everything communications-assisted autonomous driving has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, with pragmatic communications (PragComm) emerging as a promising paradigm for real-time collaboration among vehicles and other agents. Simultaneously, extensive research has explored the interplay between collaborative perception and decision-making in end-to-end driving frameworks. In this work, we revisit the collaborative driving problem and propose the Select2Drive framework to optimize the utilization of limited computational and communication resources. Particularly, to mitigate cumulative latency in perception and decision-making, Select2Drive introduces distributed predictive perception by formulating an active prediction paradigm and simplifying high-dimensional semantic feature prediction into a computation cost-efficient, motion-aware reconstruction. Given the ``less is more"" principle that an over-broadened perceptual horizon possibly confuses the decision module rather than contributing to it, Select2Drive utilizes area-of-importance-based PragComm to prioritize the communications of critical regions, thus boosting both communication efficiency and decision-making efficacy. Empirical evaluations on the V2Xverse and real-world DAIR-V2X demonstrate that Select2Drive achieves a $2.60$\% and $1.99$\% improvement in offline perception tasks under limited bandwidth (resp., pose error conditions). Moreover, it delivers at most $8.35$\% and $2.65$\% enhancement in closed-loop driving scores and route completion rates, particularly in scenarios characterized by dense traffic and high-speed dynamics."

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs. However, the gap between domain-specific knowledge and deep learning expertise often limits the practical application of PINNs.

Analyzing transaction networks facilitates fraud detection, market analysis, and supports government regulation. Despite many graph representation learning methods for transaction network analysis, we pinpoint two salient limitations that merit more investigation. Existing methods predominantly focus on the snapshots of transaction networks, sidelining the evolving nature of blockchain transaction networks. Existing methodologies may not sufficiently emphasize efficient, incremental learning capabilities, which are essential for addressing the scalability challenges in ever-expanding large-scale transaction networks. To address these challenges, we employed an incremental approach for random walk-based node representation learning in transaction networks. Further, we proposed a Metropolis-Hastings-based random walk mechanism for improved efficiency.

Meanwhile, conventional numerical methods, backed by years of meticulous refinement, continue to be the standard for accuracy and dependability. Bridging these paradigms, this research introduces the finite element neural network method (FENNM) within the framework of the Petrov-Galerkin method using convolution operations to approximate the weighted residual of the differential equations. The NN generates the global trial solution, while the test functions belong to the Lagrange test function space. FENNM introduces several key advantages. Notably, the weak-form of the differential equations introduces flux terms that contribute information to the loss function compared to VPINN, hp-VPINN, and cv-PINN. This enables the integration of forcing terms and natural boundary conditions into the loss function similar to conventional finite element method (FEM) solvers, facilitating its optimization, and extending its applicability to more complex problems, which will ease industrial adoption. This study will elaborate on the derivation of FENNM, highlighting its similarities with FEM.

2501.12756,"The increasing availability of full-field displacement data from imaging techniques in experimental mechanics is determining a gradual shift in the paradigm of material model calibration and discovery, from using several simple-geometry tests towards a few, or even one single test with complicated geometry. The feasibility of such a ""one-shot"" calibration or discovery heavily relies upon the richness of the measured displacement data, i.e., their ability to probe the space of the state variables and the stress space (whereby the stresses depend on the constitutive law being sought) to an extent sufficient for an accurate and robust calibration or discovery process. The richness of the displacement data is in turn directly governed by the specimen geometry. In this paper, we propose a density-based topology optimisation framework to optimally design the geometry of the target specimen for calibration of an anisotropic elastic material model. To this end, we perform automatic, high-resolution specimen design by maximising the robustness of the solution of the inverse problem, i.e., the identified material parameters, given noisy displacement measurements from digital image correlation. We discuss the choice of the cost function and the design of the topology optimisation framework, and we analyse a range of optimised topologies generated for the identification of isotropic and anisotropic elastic responses."

Lattice Boltzmann simulations are employed to model microstructure formation during material synthesis process, while a finite element model is used to compute the corresponding mechanical properties. To overcome the prohibitive computational demands of repeated physics-based simulations required for characterizing the impact of microstructure randomness on mechanical properties, surrogate models are developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for both microstructure generation and microstructure-property mapping. CNN training is formulated as a Bayesian inference problem to enable uncertainty quantification and provide confidence estimates in surrogate model predictions, under limited training data furnished by physics-based simulations. Numerical results demonstrate that the microstructure surrogate model effectively generates microstructural images consistent with the morphology of training data across larger domains. The Bayesian CNN surrogate accurately predicts strain energy for in-distribution microstructures and its generalization capability to interpolated morphologies are further investigated.

2501.13337,"Many real-world problems, such as airfoil design, involve optimizing a black-box expensive objective function over complex structured input space (e.g., discrete space or non-Euclidean space). By mapping the complex structured input space into a latent space of dozens of variables, a two-stage procedure labeled as generative model based optimization (GMO) in this paper, shows promise in solving such problems. However, the latent dimension of GMO is hard to determine, which may trigger the conflicting issue between desirable solution accuracy and convergence rate. To address the above issue, we propose a multi-form GMO approach, namely generative multi-form optimization (GMFoO), which conducts optimization over multiple latent spaces simultaneously to complement each other. More specifically, we devise a generative model which promotes positive correlation between latent spaces to facilitate effective knowledge transfer in GMFoO. And further, by using Bayesian optimization (BO) as the optimizer, we propose two strategies to exchange information between these latent spaces continuously. Experimental results are presented on airfoil and corbel design problems and an area maximization problem as well to demonstrate that our proposed GMFoO converges to better designs on a limited computational budget."

The centralisation occurring in Decentralised Finance (DeFi) protocols' token-based voting systems is typically analysed by examining token holdings' distribution across addresses. In this paper, we expand this perspective by exploring shared token holdings of addresses across multiple DeFi protocols. We construct a Statistically Validated Network (SVN) based on shared governance token holdings among addresses. Using the links within the SVN, we identify influential addresses that shape these connections and we conduct a post-hoc analysis to examine their characteristics and behaviour.

2501.13858,"Waveform signal analysis is a complex and important task in medical care. For example, mechanical ventilators are critical life-support machines, but they can cause serious injury to patients if they are out of synchronization with the patients' own breathing reflex. This asynchrony is revealed by the waveforms showing flow and pressure histories. Likewise, electrocardiograms record the electrical activity of a patients' heart as a set of waveforms, and anomalous waveforms can reveal important disease states. In both cases, subtle variations in a complex waveform are important information for patient care; signals which may be missed or mis-interpreted by human caregivers.We report on the design of a novel Lock Generative Adversarial Network architecture for anomaly detection in raw or summarized medical waveform data. The proposed architecture uses alternating optimization of the generator and discriminator networks to solve the convergence dilemma. Furthermore, the fidelity of the generator networks' outputs to the actual distribution of anomalous data is improved via synthetic minority oversampling.

2501.13868,"The declining cost of solar photovoltaics (PV) combined with strong federal and state-level incentives have resulted in a high number of residential solar PV installations in the US. However, these installations are concentrated in particular regions, such as California, and demographics, such as high-income Asian neighborhoods. This inequitable distribution creates an illusion that further increasing residential solar installations will become increasingly challenging. Furthermore, while the inequity in solar installations has received attention, no prior comprehensive work has been done on understanding whether our current trajectory of residential solar adoption is energy- and carbon-efficient. In this paper, we reveal the hidden energy and carbon cost of the inequitable distribution of existing installations. Using US-based data on carbon offset potential, the amount of avoided carbon emissions from using rooftop PV instead of electric grid energy, and the number of existing solar installations, we surprisingly observe that locations and demographics with a higher carbon offset potential have fewer existing installations. For instance, neighborhoods with relatively higher black population have 7.4% higher carbon offset potential than average but 36.7% fewer installations; lower-income neighborhoods have 14.7% higher potential and 47% fewer installations. We propose several equity- and carbon-aware solar siting strategies. In evaluating these strategies, we develop Sunsight, a toolkit that combines simulation/visualization tools and our relevant datasets, which we are releasing publicly. Our projections show that a multi-objective siting strategy can address two problems at once; namely, it can improve societal outcomes in terms of distributional equity and simultaneously improve the carbon-efficiency (i.e., climate impact) of current installation trends by up to 39.8%."

However, H\&E-stained images inherently lack molecular information, requiring costly and resource-intensive methods like spatial transcriptomics to map gene expression with spatial resolution. To address these challenges, we introduce HECLIP (Histology-Enhanced Contrastive Learning for Imputation of Profiles), an innovative deep learning framework that bridges the gap between histological imaging and molecular profiling. HECLIP is specifically designed to infer gene expression profiles directly from H\&E-stained images, eliminating the need for expensive spatial transcriptomics assays. HECLIP leverages an advanced image-centric contrastive loss function to optimize image representation learning, ensuring that critical morphological patterns in histology images are effectively captured and translated into accurate gene expression profiles. This design enhances the predictive power of the image modality while minimizing reliance on gene expression data. Through extensive benchmarking on publicly available datasets, HECLIP demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches, delivering robust and biologically meaningful predictions. Detailed ablation studies further underscore its effectiveness in extracting molecular insights from histology images. Additionally, HECLIP's scalable and cost-efficient approach positions it as a transformative tool for both research and clinical applications, driving advancements in precision medicine.

2501.15337,"This paper presents a computational framework for the robust stiffness design of hyperelastic structures at finite deformations subject to various uncertain sources. In particular, the loading, material properties, and geometry uncertainties are incorporated within the topology optimization framework and are modeled by random vectors or random fields. A stochastic perturbation method is adopted to quantify uncertainties, and analytical adjoint sensitivities are derived for efficient gradient-based optimization. Moreover, the mesh distortion of low-density elements under finite deformations is handled by an adaptive linear energy interpolation scheme. The proposed robust topology optimization framework is applied to several examples, and the effects of different uncertain sources on the optimized topologies are systematically investigated. As demonstrated, robust designs are less sensitive to the variation of target uncertain sources than deterministic designs. Finally, it is shown that incorporating symmetry-breaking uncertainties in the topology optimization framework promotes stable designs compared to the deterministic counterpart, where -- when no stability constraint is included -- can lead to unstable designs."

In particular, the study explores how the geometric and design variable symmetries affect the distribution of eigenvalues, distinguishing between simple and multiple eigenvalues in 3-D trusses. Moreover, this article also examines the differentiability of multiple eigenvalues under various symmetry conditions, which is crucial for gradient-based optimization. The results presented in this study show that while full symmetry ensures the differentiability of all eigenvalues, increased symmetry in optimized design, such as accidental symmetry, may lead to non-differentiable eigenvalues. Additionally, the study presents solutions using symmetric functions, demonstrating their effectiveness in ensuring differentiability in scenarios where multiple eigenvalues are non-differentiable. The study also highlights a critical insight into the differentiability criterion of symmetric functions, i.e., the completeness of eigen-clusters, which is necessary to ensure the differentiability of such functions."
2501.15406,"Engineering design risks could cause unaffordable losses, and thus risk assessment plays a critical role in engineering design. On the other hand, the high complexity of modern engineering designs makes it difficult to assess risks effectively and accurately due to the complex two-way, dynamic causal-effect risk relations in engineering designs. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new risk assessment method called token fuzzy cognitive map (Token-FCM). Its basic idea is to model the two-way causal-risk relations with the FCM method, and then augment FCM with a token mechanism to model the dynamics in causal-effect risk relations. Furthermore, the fuzzy sets and the group decision-making method are introduced to initialize the Token-FCM method so that comprehensive and accurate risk assessments can be attained. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated by a real example of engine design for a horizontal directional drilling machine."

2501.15921,"This paper describes the complete sets of data of two different machines, a PMSM and an IM, that are made available to the public for modeling and simulation validation and benchmarking. For both machines, not only the complete sets of design parameters, i.e., motor geometry, electrical parameters, material properties, and winding schemes as well as the measured low-frequency equivalent circuit parameters are provided, but also comprehensive measurement results on six different drive cycles to allow for transient investigations.

2501.18078,"Thermal protection systems (TPS) of space vehicles are designed computationally rather than experimentally. They are validated using ground experiments, but all aspects of the flight cannot be replicated on ground. This ground-to-flight mapping introduces uncertainties which need to be accounted for while designing any thermal protection system. Thus, precise computational models along with uncertainty quantification in the models are required to design the TPS. The focus of this study is to estimate the thermal material parameters of TPS based on the target reliability requirements using statistical methods. To perform uncertainty quantification (UQ) of a system, a simulated model of the system needs to be solved many times on statistical samples, increasing the computational time and cost of the overall process. A physics-informed neural network (PINN) model is used in the analysis instead of traditional physics based numerical solutions. The accuracy of PINN is comparable to that of the numerical solution. To find the parameter distribution, sampling of the parameter space is performed using Sequential Monte- Carlo (SMC) method. The sampling method is efficient as it generates samples based on the target distribution in parallel and it also generates diverse samples for proper UQ. Combining the use of both PINN predictive model and SMC sampling, the framework can approximate the parameter distributions that satisfy the TPS design reliability constraints. The framework achieved remarkable increases in the speed of performing the reliability analysis of the TPS. This reliability analysis can be used for design optimization of the TPS based on risk analysis along with other systems of the vehicle."

To obtain the case-specific best machine behavior, a strategy for the determination of stator input current amplitude and angle is employed for all possible load torques given a limited terminal current amplitude and DC bus voltage. Various losses are calculated using state of the art loss models. The electromagnetic performance of the electric machine is stored in lookup tables. These can then be used for the drive cycle analysis of the electric drive train in the design and optimization stages.To avoid the use of a dedicated mesh generator in the numerical analysis, volumetric spline-based models arethis http URLthis approach, the mesh can be generated directly from the Computer Aided Design (CAD) geometry.

2501.18781,"Metal additive manufacturing via laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) faces performance-critical challenges due to complex melt pool and vapor dynamics, often oversimplified by computational models that neglect crucial aspects, such as vapor jet formation. To address this limitation, we propose a consistent computational multi-physics mesoscale model to study melt pool dynamics, laser-induced evaporation, and vapor flow. In addition to the evaporation-induced pressure jump, we also resolve the evaporation-induced volume expansion and the resulting velocity jump at the liquid--vapor interface. We use an anisothermal incompressible Navier--Stokes solver extended by a conservative diffuse level-set framework and integrate it into a matrix-free adaptive finite element framework. To ensure accurate physical solutions despite extreme density, pressure and velocity gradients across the diffuse liquid--vapor interface, we employ consistent interface source term formulations developed in our previous work. These formulations consider projection operations to extend solution variables from the sharp liquid--vapor interface into the computational domain. Benchmark examples, including film boiling, confirm the accuracy and versatility of the model. As a key result, we demonstrate the model's ability to capture the strong coupling between melt and vapor flow dynamics in PBF-LB/M based on simulations of stationary laser illumination on a metal plate. Additionally, we show the derivation of the well-known Anisimov model and extend it to a new hybrid model. This hybrid model, together with consistent interface source term formulations, especially for the level-set transport velocity, enables PBF-LB/M simulations that combine accurate physical results with the robustness of an incompressible, diffuse-interface computational modeling framework."
2501.1885,"Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) remains a fundamental challenge with significant implications for the development of new materials and the advancement of various scientific disciplines. Recent developments have shown that generative models, particularly diffusion models, hold great promise for CSP. However, traditional graph-based representations, where atomic bonds are modeled as pairwise graph edges, fail to fully capture the intricate high-order interactions essential for accurately representing crystal structures. In this work, we propose a novel approach that utilizes hypergraphs to represent crystal structures, providing a more expressive abstraction for modeling multi-way atomic interactions. By adopting hypergraphs, we can effectively capture complex high-order relationships and symmetries, such as permutation and periodic translation invariance, which are crucial for characterizing crystal structures. In this work, we propose the \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{H}ypergraph \textbf{Diff}usion Model (\textbf{EH-Diff}), a generative model designed to take advantage of the symmetry-preserving properties of hypergraphs. EH-Diff exploits these features to offer an efficient and accurate method for predicting crystal structures with a strong theoretical justification to preserve invariance properties. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that EH-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art CSP methods with only one sample."
2501.18945,"We consider the inverse problem of multi-armed bandits (IMAB) that are widely used in neuroscience and psychology research for behavior modelling. We first show that the IMAB problem is not convex in general, but can be relaxed to a convex problem via variable transformation. Based on this result, we propose a two-step sequential heuristic for (approximately) solving the IMAB problem. We discuss a condition where our method provides global solution to the IMAB problem with certificate, as well as approximations to further save computing time. Numerical experiments indicate that our heuristic method is more robust than directly solving the IMAB problem via repeated local optimization, and can achieve the performance of Monte Carlo methods within a significantly decreased running time. We provide the implementation of our method based on CVXPY, which allows straightforward application by users not well versed in convex optimization."
2501.19013,"Immersed boundary methods have attracted substantial interest in the last decades due to their potential for computations involving complex geometries. Often these cannot be efficiently discretized using boundary-fitted finite elements. Immersed boundary methods provide a simple and fully automatic discretization based on Cartesian grids and tailored quadrature schemes that account for the geometric model. It can thus be described independently of the grid, e.g., by image data obtained from computed tomography scans. The drawback of such a discretization lies in the potentially small overlap between certain elements in the grid and the geometry. These badly cut elements with small physical support pose a particular challenge for nonlinear and/or dynamic simulations. In this work, we focus on problems in structural dynamics and acoustics and concentrate on solving them with explicit time-marching schemes. In this context, badly cut elements can lead to unfeasibly small critical time step sizes. We investigate the performance of implicit-explicit time marching schemes and two stabilization methods developed in previous works as potential remedies. While these have been studied before with regard to their effectiveness in increasing the critical time step size, their numerical efficiency has only been considered in terms of accuracy per degree of freedom. In this paper, we evaluate the computation time required for a given accuracy, which depends not only on the number of degrees of freedom but also on the selected spatial discretization, the sparsity patterns of the system matrices, and the employed time-marching scheme."
2501.19267,"As the financial industry becomes more interconnected and reliant on digital systems, fraud detection systems must evolve to meet growing threats. Cloud-enabled Transformer models present a transformative opportunity to address these challenges. By leveraging the scalability, flexibility, and advanced AI capabilities of cloud platforms, companies can deploy fraud detection solutions that adapt to real-time data patterns and proactively respond to evolving threats. Using the Graph self-attention Transformer neural network module, we can directly excavate gang fraud features from the transaction network without constructing complicated feature engineering. Finally, the fraud prediction network is combined to optimize the topological pattern and the temporal transaction pattern to realize the high-precision detection of fraudulent transactions.

2502.00227,"This paper presents a single-life reinforcement learning (SLRL) approach to adaptively select the dimension of the Krylov subspace during the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) iteration. GMRES is an iterative algorithm for solving large and sparse linear systems of equations in the form of \(Ax = b\) which are mainly derived from partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed framework uses RL to adjust the Krylov subspace dimension (m) in the GMRES (m) algorithm. This research demonstrates that altering the dimension of the Krylov subspace in an online setup using SLRL can accelerate the convergence of the GMRES algorithm by more than an order of magnitude. A comparison of different matrix sizes and sparsity levels is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive Krylov subspace exploration using single-life RL (AK-SLRL). We compare AK-SLRL with constant-restart GMRES by applying the highest restart value used in AK-SLRL to the GMRES method. The results show that using an adjustable restart parameter with single-life soft-actor critic (SLSAC) and an experience replay buffer sized to half the matrix dimension converges significantly faster than the constant restart GMRES with higher values. Higher values of the restart parameter are equivalent to a higher number of Arnoldi iterations to construct an orthonormal basis for the Krylov subspace $ K_m(A, r_0) $. This process includes constructing $m$ orthonormal vectors and updating the Hessenberg matrix $H$. Therefore, lower values of $m$ result in reduced computation needed in GMRES minimization to solve the least-squares problem in the smaller Hessenberg matrix. The robustness of the result is validated through a wide range of matrix dimensions and sparsity. This paper contributes to the series of RL combinations with numerical solvers to achieve accelerated scientific computing."

2502.00476,"Offshore wind power is a renewable energy of growing relevance in current electric energy systems, presenting favorable wind conditions in comparison with the sites on land. However, the higher energy yield has to compensate the increment in installation and maintenance costs, thus the importance of optimizing resources. One relevant aspect to increase profitability is the wind farm layout. The aim of this paper is to propose a new method to maximize the expected power production of offshore wind farms by setting the appropriate layout, i.e. minimizing the wake effects. The method uses a sequential procedure for global optimization consisting of two steps: i) an heuristic method to set an initial random layout configuration, and ii) the use of nonlinear mathematical programming techniques for local optimization, which use the random layout as an initial solution. The method takes full advantage of the most up-to-date mathematical programming techniques while performing a global optimization approach, which can be easily parallelized. The performance of the proposed procedure is tested using the German offshore wind farm Alpha Ventus, located in the North Sea, yielding an increment of expected annual power production of 3.52% with respect to the actual configuration. According to current electricity prices in Germany, this constitutes an expected profit increment of almost 1 M per year."
2502.00486,"Hindcast or wave reanalysis databases (WRDB) constitute a powerful source with respect to instrumental records in the design of offshore and coastal structures, since they offer important advantages for the statistical characterization of wave climate variables, such as continuous long time records of significant wave heights, mean and peak periods, etc. However, reanalysis data is less accurate than instrumental records, making extreme data analysis derived from WRDB prone to under predict design return period values. This paper proposes a mixed extreme value model to deal with maxima, which takes full advantage of both (i) hindcast or wave reanalysis and (ii) instrumental records, reducing the uncertainty in its predictions. The resulting mixed model consistently merges the information given by both kinds of data sets, and it can be applied to any extreme value analysis distribution, such as generalized extreme value, peaks over threshold or Pareto-Poisson. The methodology is illustrated using both synthetically generated and real data, the latter taken from a given location on the northern Spanish coast."

To enhance accuracy, we developed a Custom GPT, embedding refined prompts directly into its instructions. This optimized model achieved an 82% score, surpassing the 75% student average, demonstrating the impact of tailored guidance. Despite these improvements, LLMs continued to exhibit errors in nuanced or open-ended problems, such as misidentifying tension and compression in truss members. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of AI in structural analysis, emphasizing the need for improved reasoning, multimodal capabilities, and targeted training data for future AI-driven automation in civil and mechanical engineering."
2502.00795,"Accurately capturing the full-range response of structures is crucial in structural health monitoring (SHM) for ensuring safety and operational integrity. However, limited sensor deployment due to cost, accessibility, or scale often hinders comprehensive monitoring. This paper presents a generative data fusion framework utilizing diffusion models, to reconstruct the full-range structural response from sparse and heterogeneous sensor measurements. We incorporate Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) into the reconstruction framework, using sensor measurements as probabilistic constraints to guide the sampling process. Three forward models are designed: Direct Observation Mapping (DOM), Channel-based Observation Mapping (COM), and Neural Network Forward Model (NNFM), enabling flexible adaptation to different sensor placement conditions and reconstruction targets. The proposed framework is validated on a steel plate shear wall exhibiting nonlinear responses. By simultaneously sampling 100 realizations and averaging them as the ensemble prediction result, the three forward models achieve Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Errors of 1.62% (DOM), 3.27% (COM), and 3.49% (NNFM). Sensitivity analyses further demonstrate robust performance under varying hyperparameters, sensor configurations, and noise levels. The proposed framework shows new possibilities for probabilistic modeling and decision-making in SHM by harnessing the capabilities of diffusion models, offering a novel data fusion approach for full-range monitoring of structures."

2502.01043,"The Transatomic Power (TAP) reactor has an unusual design for a molten salt reactor technology, building upon the foundation laid by the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). This design introduces three key modifications to enhance efficiency and compactness: a revised fuel salt composition, an alternative moderator material, and moderator pins surrounded by the molten salt fuel. Unlike traditional solid-fueled reactors that rely on excess positive reactivity at the beginning of life, the TAP concept employs a dynamic approach. The core's design, featuring a cylindrical geometry with square assemblies of moderator rods surrounded by flowing fuel salt, provides flexibility in adjusting the moderator-to-fuel ratio during operation - using movable moderator rods - further adding criticality control capability in addition to the control rods system. Shape optimization of the core can play a crucial role in enhancing performance and efficiency. By applying multiphysics continuous shape optimization techniques to key components, such as the unit cells of the TAP reactor or its moderator assemblies, we can fine-tune the reactor's geometry to achieve optimal performance in key physics like neutronics and thermal hydraulics. We explore this aspect using the optimization module in the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework which allows for multiphysics continuous shape optimization. The results reported here illustrate the benefits of applying continuous shape optimization in the design of nuclear reactor components and can help in extending the TAP reactor's performance."
2502.01248,"Heat-based cancer treatment, so-called hyperthermia, can be used to destroy tumour cells directly or to make them more susceptible to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. To apply heat locally, iron oxide nanoparticles are injected into the bloodstream and accumulate at the tumour site, where they generate heat when exposed to an alternating magnetic field. However, the temperature must be precisely controlled to achieve therapeutic benefits while avoiding damage to healthy tissue. We therefore present a computational model for nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia treatment fully integrated into a multiphase porous-media model of the tumour and its microenvironment. We study how the temperature depends on the amount of nanoparticles accumulated in the tumour area and the specific absorption rate of the nanoparticles. Our results show that host tissue surrounding the tumour is also exposed to considerable doses of heat due to the high thermal conductivity of the tissue, which may cause pain or even unnecessary irreversible damage. Further, we include a lumped and a discrete model for the cooling effect of blood perfusion. Using a discrete model of a realistic microvasculature reveals that the small capillaries do not have a significant cooling effect during hyperthermia treatment and that the commonly used lumped model based on Pennes' bioheat equation overestimates the effect: within the specific conditions analysed, the difference between lumped and discrete approaches is approximatively 0.75°C, which could influence the therapeutic intervention outcome. Such a comprehensive computational model, as presented here, can provide insights into the optimal treatment parameters for nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia and can be used to design more efficient treatment strategies."
2502.01337,"We introduce the Neural Preconditioning Operator (NPO), a novel approach designed to accelerate Krylov solvers in solving large, sparse linear systems derived from partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike classical preconditioners that often require extensive tuning and struggle to generalize across different meshes or parameters, NPO employs neural operators trained via condition and residual losses. This framework seamlessly integrates with existing neural network models, serving effectively as a preconditioner to enhance the performance of Krylov subspace methods. Further, by melding algebraic multigrid principles with a transformer-based architecture, NPO significantly reduces iteration counts and runtime for solving Poisson, Diffusion, and Linear Elasticity problems on both uniform and irregular meshes. Our extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that NPO outperforms traditional methods and contemporary neural approaches across various resolutions, ensuring robust convergence even on grids as large as 4096, far exceeding its initial training limits. These findings underscore the potential of data-driven preconditioning to transform the computational efficiency of high-dimensional PDE applications."

2502.01506,"The study of social emergence has long been a central focus in social science. Traditional modeling approaches, such as rule-based Agent-Based Models (ABMs), struggle to capture the diversity and complexity of human behavior, particularly the irrational factors emphasized in behavioral economics. Recently, large language model (LLM) agents have gained traction as simulation tools for modeling human behavior in social science and role-playing applications. Studies suggest that LLMs can account for cognitive biases, emotional fluctuations, and other non-rational influences, enabling more realistic simulations of socio-economic dynamics. In this work, we introduce TwinMarket, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to simulate socio-economic systems. Specifically, we examine how individual behaviors, through interactions and feedback mechanisms, give rise to collective dynamics and emergent phenomena. Through experiments in a simulated stock market environment, we demonstrate how individual actions can trigger group behaviors, leading to emergent outcomes such as financial bubbles and recessions. Our approach provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between individual decision-making and collective socio-economic patterns."
2502.0182,"Modeling plays a critical role in additive manufacturing (AM), enabling a deeper understanding of underlying processes. Parametric solutions for such models are of great importance, enabling the optimization of production processes and considerable cost reductions. However, the complexity of the problem and diversity of spatio-temporal scales involved in the process pose significant challenges for traditional numerical methods. Surrogate models offer a powerful alternative by accelerating simulations and facilitating real-time monitoring and control. The present study presents an operator learning approach that relies on the deep operator network (DeepONet) and physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to predict the three-dimensional temperature distribution during melting and consolidation in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Parametric solutions for both single-track and multi-track scenarios with respect to tool path are obtained. To address the challenges in obtaining parametric solutions for multi-track scenarios using DeepONet architecture, a sequential PINN approach is proposed to efficiently manage the increased training complexity inherent in those scenarios. The accuracy and consistency of the model are verified against finite-difference computations. The developed surrogate allows us to efficiently analyze the effect of scanning paths and laser parameters on the thermal history."
2502.0183,"Engineers learn from every design they create, building intuition that helps them quickly identify promising solutions for new problems. Topology optimization (TO) - a well-established computational method for designing structures with optimized performance - lacks this ability to learn from experience. Existing approaches treat design tasks in isolation, starting from a ""blank canvas"" design for each new problem, often requiring many computationally expensive steps to converge. We propose a meta-learning strategy, termed meta-neural TO, that finds effective initial designs through a systematic transfer of knowledge between related tasks, building on the mesh-agnostic representation provided by neural reparameterization. We compare our approach against established TO methods, demonstrating efficient optimization across diverse test cases without compromising design quality. Further, we demonstrate powerful cross-resolution transfer capabilities, where initializations learned on lower-resolution discretizations lead to superior convergence in 74.1% of tasks on a higher-resolution test set, reducing the average number of iterations by 33.6% compared to standard neural TO. Remarkably, we discover that meta-learning naturally gravitates toward the strain energy patterns found in uniform density designs as effective starting points, aligning with engineering intuition."
2502.02052,"Plasticity is inherent to many engineering materials such as metals. While it can degrade the load-carrying capacity of structures via material yielding, it can also protect structures through plastic energy dissipation. To fully harness plasticity, here we present the theory, method, and application of a topology optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes structural geometries and material phases to customize the stiffness, strength, and structural toughness of designs experiencing finite strain elastoplasticity. The framework accurately predicts structural responses by employing a rigorous, mechanics-based elastoplasticity theory that ensures isochoric plastic flow. It also effectively identifies optimal material phase distributions using a gradient-based optimizer, where gradient information is obtained via a reversed adjoint method to address history dependence, along with automatic differentiation to compute the complex partial derivatives. We demonstrate the framework by optimizing a range of 2D and 3D elastoplastic structures, including energy-dissipating dampers, load-carrying beams, impact-resisting bumpers, and cold working profiled sheets. These optimized multimaterial structures reveal important mechanisms for improving design performance under large deformation, such as the transition from kinematic to isotropic hardening with increasing displacement amplitudes and the formation of twisted regions that concentrate stress, enhancing plastic energy dissipation. Through the superior performance of these optimized designs, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in tailoring elastoplastic responses across various spatial configurations, material types, hardening behaviors, and combinations of candidate materials. This work offers a systematic approach for optimizing next-generation multimaterial structures with elastoplastic behaviors under large deformations."
2502.02457,"Multiscale simulations are indispensable for connecting microstructural features to the macroscopic behavior of polycrystalline materials, but their high computational demands limit their practicality. Deep material networks (DMNs) have been proposed as efficient surrogate models, yet they fall short of capturing texture evolution. To address this limitation, we propose the orientation-aware interaction-based deep material network (ODMN), which incorporates an orientation-aware mechanism and an interaction mechanism grounded in the Hill-Mandel principle. The orientation-aware mechanism learns the crystallographic textures, while the interaction mechanism captures stress-equilibrium directions among representative volume element (RVE) subregions, offering insight into internal microstructural mechanics. Notably, ODMN requires only linear elastic data for training yet generalizes effectively to complex nonlinear and anisotropic responses. Our results show that ODMN accurately predicts both mechanical responses and texture evolution under complex plastic deformation, thus expanding the applicability of DMNs to polycrystalline materials. By balancing computational efficiency with predictive fidelity, ODMN provides a robust framework for multiscale simulations of polycrystalline materials."

2502.02592,"In general, there is a mismatch between a finite element model of a structure and its real behaviour. In aeronautics, this mismatch must be small because finite element models are a fundamental part of the development of an aircraft and of increasing importance with the trend to more flexible wings in modern designs. Finite element model updating can be computationally expensive for complex structures and surrogate models can be employed to reduce the computational burden. A novel approach for finite element model updating, namely assembly-like, is proposed and validated using real experimental data. The assembly-like model updating framework implies that the model is updated as parts are assembled. Benchmarking against the classical global, or one-shot, approach demonstrates that the proposed method is more computationally efficient since it takes 20% fewer iterations to obtain convergence, also using fewer parameters for the model evaluations. Despite the increase in computational performance, the new approach retains the fidelity of the global approach."

The robust construction of these struts is crucial for downstream design and manufacturing applications, as it provides a detailed shape description necessary for precise simulation and fabrication. However, constructing lattice structures presents significant challenges, particularly at nodes where multiple struts intersect. The complexity of these intersections can lead to robustness issues. To address this challenge, this paper presents an optimization-based approach that simplifies the construction of lattice structures by cutting struts and connecting them to optimized node shapes. By utilizing the recent Grey Wolf optimization method -- a type of meta-heuristic method -- for node shape design, the approach ensures robust model construction and optimal shape design. Its effectiveness has been validated through a series of case studies with increasing topological and geometric complexity."
2502.02605,"Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) plays a pivotal role in fluid mechanics, enabling precise simulations of fluid behavior through partial differential equations (PDEs). However, traditional CFD methods are resource-intensive, particularly for high-fidelity simulations of complex flows, which are further complicated by high dimensionality, inherent stochasticity, and limited data availability. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a data-driven approach that leverages a Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) to encode high-dimensional scientific data into low-dimensional, physically meaningful representations. The GMVAE learns a structured latent space where data can be categorized based on physical properties such as the Reynolds number while maintaining global physical consistency. To assess the interpretability of the learned representations, we introduce a novel metric based on graph spectral theory, quantifying the smoothness of physical quantities along the latent manifold. We validate our approach using 2D Navier-Stokes simulations of flow past a cylinder over a range of Reynolds numbers. Our results demonstrate that the GMVAE provides improved clustering, meaningful latent structure, and robust generative capabilities compared to baseline dimensionality reduction methods. This framework offers a promising direction for data-driven turbulence modeling and broader applications in computational fluid dynamics and engineering systems."

The optimal tensor network structure for a given data tensor depends on both data characteristics and specific optimality criteria, making tensor network structure search a difficult problem. Existing solutions typically rely on sampling and compressing numerous candidate structures; these procedures are computationally expensive and therefore limiting for practical applications. We address this challenge by viewing tensor network structure search as a program synthesis problem and introducing an efficient constraint-based assessment method that avoids costly tensor decomposition. Specifically, we establish a correspondence between transformation programs and network structures. We also design a novel operation named output-directed splits to reduce the search space without hindering expressiveness. We then propose a synthesis algorithm to identify promising network candidates through constraint solving, and avoid tensor decomposition for all but the most promising candidates. Experimental results show that our approach improves search speed by up to $10\times$ and achieves compression ratios $1.5\times$ to $3\times$ better than state-of-the-art. Notably, our approach scales to larger tensors that are unattainable by prior work. Furthermore, the discovered topologies generalize well to similar data, yielding compression ratios up to $ 2.4\times$ better than a generic structure while the runtime remains around $110$ seconds."
2502.039,"Variational phase field fracture models are now widely used to simulate crack propagation in structures. A critical aspect of these simulations is the correct determination of the propagation threshold of pre-existing cracks, as it highly relies on how the initial cracks are implemented. While prior studies briefly discuss initial crack implementation techniques, we present here a systematic investigation. Various techniques to introduce initial cracks in phase field fracture simulations are tested, from the crack explicit meshing to the replacement by a fully damaged phase field, including different variants for the boundary conditions. Our focus here is on phase field models aiming to approximate, in the $\Gamma$-convergence limit, Griffith quasi-static propagation in the framework of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics. Therefore, a sharp crack model from classic linear elastic fracture mechanics based on Griffith criterion is the reference in this work. To assess the different techniques to introduce initial cracks, we rely on path-following methods to compute the sharp crack and the phase field smeared crack solutions. The underlying idea is that path-following ensures staying at equilibrium at each instant so that any difference between phase field and sharp crack models can be attributed to numerical artifacts. Thus, by comparing the results from both models, we can provide practical recommendations for reliably incorporating initial cracks in phase field fracture simulations. The comparison shows that an improper initial crack implementation often requires the smeared crack to transition to a one-element-wide phase band to adequately represent a displacement jump along a crack. This transition increases the energy required to propagate the crack, leading to a significant overshoot in the force-displacement response. The take-home message is that to predict the propagation threshold accurately and avoid artificial toughening; the crack must be initialized either setting the phase field to its damage state over a one-element-wide band or meshing the crack explicitly as a one-element-wide slit and imposing the fully cracked state on the crack surface."
2502.03935,"Accurate and efficient thermal simulations of induction machines are indispensable for detecting thermal hot spots and hence avoiding potential material failure in an early design stage. A goal is the better utilization of the machines with reduced safety margins due to a better knowledge of the critical conditions. In this work, the parameters of a two-dimensional induction machine model are calibrated according to evidence from measurements, by solving an inverse field problem. The set of parameters comprise material parameters as well as parameters that model three-dimensional effects. This allows a consideration of physical effects without explicit knowledge of its quantities. First, the accuracy of the approach is studied using an academic example in combination with synthetic data. Afterwards, it is successfully applied to a realistic induction machine model."
2502.0448,"A technique to combine codes to solve barely coupled multiphysics problems has been developed. Each field is advanced separately until a stop is triggered. This could be due to a preset time increment, a preset number of timesteps, a preset decrease of residuals, a preset change in unknowns, a preset change in geometry, or any other physically meaningful quantity. The technique allows for a simple implementation in coupled codes using the loose coupling approach. Examples from evaporative cooling of electric motors, a problem that has come to the forefront with the rise of electric propulsion in the aerospace sector (drones and air taxis in particular) shows the viability and accuracy of the proposed procedure."
2502.05107,"Structure-based drug discovery, encompassing the tasks of protein-ligand docking and pocket-aware 3D drug design, represents a core challenge in drug discovery. However, no existing work can deal with both tasks to effectively leverage the duality between them, and current methods for each task are hindered by challenges in modeling 3D information and the limitations of available data. To address these issues, we propose 3DMolFormer, a unified dual-channel transformer-based framework applicable to both docking and 3D drug design tasks, which exploits their duality by utilizing docking functionalities within the drug design process. Specifically, we represent 3D pocket-ligand complexes using parallel sequences of discrete tokens and continuous numbers, and we design a corresponding dual-channel transformer model to handle this format, thereby overcoming the challenges of 3D information modeling. Additionally, we alleviate data limitations through large-scale pre-training on a mixed dataset, followed by supervised and reinforcement learning fine-tuning techniques respectively tailored for the two tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DMolFormer outperforms previous approaches in both protein-ligand docking and pocket-aware 3D drug design, highlighting its promising application in structure-based drug discovery.

2502.05195,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in reasoning, demonstrating their capability to generate human-like responses. This study analyzes the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in the domain of thermodynamics. A benchmark of 22 thermodynamic problems to evaluate LLMs is presented that contains both simple and advanced problems. Five different LLMs are assessed: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o from OpenAI, Llama 3.1 from Meta, and le Chat from MistralAI. The answers of these LLMs were evaluated by trained human experts, following a methodology akin to the grading of academic exam responses. The scores and the consistency of the answers are discussed, together with the analytical skills of the LLMs. Both strengths and weaknesses of the LLMs become evident. They generally yield good results for the simple problems, but also limitations become clear: The LLMs do not provide consistent results, they often fail to fully comprehend the context and make wrong assumptions. Given the complexity and domain-specific nature of the problems, the statistical language modeling approach of the LLMs struggles with the accurate interpretation and the required reasoning. The present results highlight the need for more systematic integration of thermodynamic knowledge with LLMs, for example, by using knowledge-based methods."

This paper introduces a novel network architecture, XNet, which significantly enhances the computational efficiency and accuracy of the Deep BSDE method. XNet demonstrates superior approximation capabilities with fewer parameters, addressing the trade-off between approximation and optimization errors found in existing methods. We detail the implementation of XNet within the Deep BSDE framework and present results that show marked improvements in solving high-dimensional PDEs, potentially setting a new standard for such computations."
2502.06707,"Recently, combining stock features with inter-stock correlations has become a common and effective approach for stock movement prediction. However, financial data presents significant challenges due to its low signal-to-noise ratio and the dynamic complexity of the market, which give rise to two key limitations in existing methods. First, the relationships between stocks are highly influenced by multifaceted factors including macroeconomic market dynamics, and current models fail to adaptively capture these evolving interactions under specific market conditions. Second, for the accuracy and timeliness required by real-world trading, existing financial data mining methods struggle to extract beneficial pattern-oriented dependencies from long historical data while maintaining high efficiency and low memory consumption. To address the limitations, we propose FinMamba, a Mamba-GNN-based framework for market-aware and multi-level hybrid stock movement prediction. Specifically, we devise a dynamic graph to learn the changing representations of inter-stock relationships by integrating a pruning module that adapts to market trends. Afterward, with a selective mechanism, the multi-level Mamba discards irrelevant information and resets states to skillfully recall historical patterns across multiple time scales with linear time costs, which are then jointly optimized for reliable prediction. Extensive experiments on U.S. and Chinese stock markets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FinMamba, achieving state-of-the-art prediction accuracy and trading profitability, while maintaining low computational complexity.

2502.07384,"Phosphorylation site prediction based on kinase-substrate interaction plays a vital role in understanding cellular signaling pathways and disease mechanisms. Computational methods for this task can be categorized into kinase-family-focused and individual kinase-targeted approaches. Individual kinase-targeted methods have gained prominence for their ability to explore a broader protein space and provide more precise target information for kinase inhibitors. However, most existing individual kinase-based approaches focus solely on sequence inputs, neglecting crucial structural information. To address this limitation, we introduce SAGEPhos (Structure-aware kinAse-substrate bio-coupled and bio-auGmented nEtwork for Phosphorylation site prediction), a novel framework that modifies the semantic space of main protein inputs using auxiliary inputs at two distinct modality levels. At the inter-modality level, SAGEPhos introduces a Bio-Coupled Modal Fusion method, distilling essential kinase sequence information to refine task-oriented local substrate feature space, creating a shared semantic space that captures crucial kinase-substrate interaction patterns. Within the substrate's intra-modality domain, it focuses on Bio-Augmented Fusion, emphasizing 2D local sequence information while selectively incorporating 3D spatial information from predicted structures to complement the sequence space. Moreover, to address the lack of structural information in current datasets, we contribute a new, refined phosphorylation site prediction dataset, which incorporates crucial structural elements and will serve as a new benchmark for the field. Experimental results demonstrate that SAGEPhos significantly outperforms baseline methods. We release the SAGEPhos models and code atthis https URL."
2502.07791,"Numerical modelling of coupled multiphysics phenomena is becoming an increasingly important subject in applied mathematics. The main challenge in teaching this subject is the complexity of both the mathematical models and their numerical implementation. In this note, a simple demonstrator is proposed that enables demonstration of and some hands-on experience with three types of coupling commonly used in computational science: one-way coupling, explicit sequential coupling, and full coupling. It makes use of a familiar nonlinear heat equation in 1D, with the solution being a propagating heat wave."
2502.08232,"This paper introduces a new platform to accelerate the modeling of complex aerothermochemical interactions in new turbomachines, turbo-reactors, to decarbonise chemical processes. While previous work has aerothermally demonstrated the potential to decarbonize the heat input to the reaction, optimizing the reaction efficiency has been a challenge. This is because measuring reaction performance with aerochemical simulations is computationally prohibitive due to the uniquely complex aerodynamics and chemistry within turbomachines. To address this, we introduce a new multifidelity machine-learning-assisted methodology, called ChemZIP, to mitigate this bottleneck. Although data-driven methodologies exist for combustion, modeling reactive flows along the bladed path of a turbomachine poses new challenges. This has led to a novel training data generation process, which allows rich dynamic responses of the chemical system to be embedded into the training dataset at a fraction of the cost of reacting flow simulations. The resulting high-dimensional composition vector is compressed into a low-dimensional basis using an autoencoder-like neural network, inspired by but more universal than traditional flamelet-generated manifolds. Verification against 10,000 unseen one-dimensional test conditions shows an R2 score exceeding 95% across all quantities of interest. Following this, ChemZIP is coupled into a fully-fledged viscous computational fluid dynamics solver. For a set of process-relevant three-dimensional configurations entirely different from the training data, the predictive accuracy of the thermochemical state remains within 10% of an industry-standard solver while convergence is achieved 50 times faster, even for a small mechanism. Therefore, numerical computations are sufficiently fast that aerothermochemical optimization is now feasible for the first time in the design cycle"
2502.08525,"In this work, we investigate the problem of measuring a the centre checkerboard target in an 3D point cloud. This is an important problem which has applications in registration, long term monitoring and linking to other sensor systems. We use a 3D template matching approach based on the coloured ICP algorithm to solve the problem. We tackle the problem under the additional constraints that we assume no structure in the 3D data in order to be able to handle unordered point clouds. This gives us the capability to process data from the new generation of low-cost LIDAR sensors. This category of sensors also suffers from increased noise in range and reflectivity measurement. We provide extensive simulation results using synthetic data to capture the potential of the approach. We then give the detailed steps for handling real sensor data."
2502.08534,"This paper presents a novel framework of neural networks for isotropic hyperelasticity that enforces necessary physical and mathematical constraints while simultaneously satisfying the universal approximation theorem. The two key ingredients are an input convex network architecture and a formulation in the elementary polynomials of the signed singular values of the deformation gradient. In line with previously published networks, it can rigorously capture frame-indifference and polyconvexity - as well as further constraints like balance of angular momentum and growth conditions. However and in contrast to previous networks, a universal approximation theorem for the proposed approach is proven. To be more explicit, the proposed network can approximate any frame-indifferent, isotropic polyconvex energy (provided the network is large enough). This is possible by working with a sufficient and necessary criterion for frame-indifferent, isotropic polyconvex functions. Comparative studies with existing approaches identify the advantages of the proposed method, particularly in approximating non-polyconvex energies as well as computing polyconvex hulls."
2502.08688,"Without radical technological advancements, the global aviation industry will continue to be a major carbon emitter. To reduce aviation's carbon emissions, innovative aircraft technology, including electrified aircraft propulsion, is under development. However, current aircraft sizing tools require detailed design information that may not be available early in the development process, particularly for novel technologies. This can yield suboptimal designs and inhibits innovation. A computational tool is needed to easily and rapidly size an aircraft configuration while allowing the designer to explore the design space, examine tradeoffs, and evaluate alternative designs. The Future Aircraft Sizing Tool (FAST), developed in Matlab, addresses this challenge by rapidly sizing aircraft with any propulsion architecture, including conventional, electric, and hybrid electric systems, even with limited initial data. FAST enables engineers to explore various aircraft configurations, evaluate design alternatives, assess performance across a flight envelope, and visualize concepts during the sizing process. By supporting early stage design, FAST addresses a gap in currently available computational tools for developing sustainable aviation technologies to help reduce the industry's carbon footprint."
2502.0901,"Understanding the behavior of particles in a dispersed phase system via population balances holds fundamental importance in studies of particulate sciences across various fields. Particle behavior, however, is sophisticated as a single particle can undergo internal property changes (e.g., size, cell age, and energy content) through various mechanisms. When confronted with an unknown distributed particulate system, discovering the underlying population balance equation (PBE) entails firstly learning the underlying particulate phenomena followed by the associated phenomenological laws that govern the kinetics and mechanisms of particle transformations in their local conditions. Conventional inverse problem approaches reveal the shape of phenomenological functions for predetermined forms of PBE (e.g., pure breakage/aggregation PBE, etc.). However, these methods can be limited in their ability to uncover the mechanisms which govern uncharacterized particulate systems from data. Leveraging the increasing abundance of data, we devise a data-driven framework based on sparse regression to learn PBEs as linear combinations of an extensive pool of candidate terms. Thus, this approach enables effective and accurate functional identification of PBEs without assuming the structure a priori, hence mitigating any potential loss of details, while minimizing model overfitting and providing a more interpretable representation of particulate systems. We showcase the proficiency of our approach across a wide spectrum of particulate systems, ranging from simple canonical pure breakage and pure aggregation systems to complex systems with multiple particulate processes. Our approach holds the potential to generalize the discovery of PBEs along with their phenomenological laws from data, thus facilitating wider adoption of population balances."
2502.09355,"A mechanical model and finite element method for the simultaneous solution of Stokes and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows on multiple curved surfaces over a bulk domain are proposed. The two-dimensional surfaces are defined implicitly by all level sets of a scalar function, bounded by the three-dimensional bulk domain. This bulk domain is discretized with hexahedral finite elements which do not necessarily conform with the level sets but with the boundary. The resulting numerical method is a hybrid between conforming and non-conforming finite element methods. Taylor-Hood elements or equal-order element pairs for velocity and pressure, together with stabilization techniques, are applied to fulfil the inf-sup conditions resulting from the mixed-type formulation of the governing equations. Numerical studies confirm good agreement with independently obtained solutions on selected, individual surfaces. Furthermore, higher-order convergence rates are obtained for sufficiently smooth solutions."
2502.09905,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening condition involving the permanent dilation of the aorta, often detected incidentally through imaging for some other condition. The standard clinical approach to managing AAA follows a one-size-fits-all model based on aneurysm size and growth rate, leading to underestimation or overestimation of rupture risk in individual patients. The widely studied stress-based rupture risk estimation using computational biomechanics requires wall strength information. However, non-invasive methods for local patient-specific wall strength measurement have not yet been developed. Recently, we introduced an image-based approach for patient-specific, in vivo, non-invasive AAA kinematic analysis using time-resolved 3D computed tomography angiography (4D-CTA) images to measure wall strain throughout the cardiac cycle. In the present study, we integrated wall tension computation and strain measurement to develop a novel measure of local structural integrity of AAA wall - Relative Structural Integrity Index (RSII), independent of material properties and thickness of the wall and conditions of blood pressure measurement. Our methods provide a visual map of AAA wall structural integrity for individual patients using only their medical images and blood pressure data. We applied our methods to twelve patients. Additionally, we compared our measure of structural integrity of aneurysmal and non-aneurysmal aortas. Our results show similar values of the wall structural integrity measure across the patients, indicating the reliability of our methods. In line with experimental observations reported in the literature, our analysis revealed that localized low stiffness areas are primarily found in the most dilated AAA regions. Our results clearly demonstrate that the AAA wall is stiffer than the non-aneurysmal aorta."
2502.09978,"Internet of Things (IoTs) have been widely applied in Collaborative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) for the prevention of road accidents. As one of the primary causes of road accidents in C-ITS, the efficient detection and early alarm of road hazards are of paramount importance. Given the importance, extensive research has explored this topic and obtained favorable results. However, most existing solutions only explore single-modality data, struggle with high computation and communication overhead, or suffer from the curse of high dimensionality in their privacy-preserving methodologies. To overcome these obstacles, in this paper, we introduce RoadFed, an innovative and private multimodal Federated learning-based system tailored for intelligent Road hazard detection and alarm. This framework encompasses an innovative Multimodal Road Hazard Detector, a communication-efficient federated learning approach, and a customized low-error-rate local differential privacy method crafted for high dimensional multimodal data. Experimental results reveal that the proposed RoadFed surpasses most existing systems in the self-gathered real-world and CrisisMMD public datasets. In particular, RoadFed achieves an accuracy of 96.42% with a mere 0.0351 seconds of latency and its communication cost is up to 1,000 times lower than existing systems in this field. It facilitates collaborative training with non-iid high dimensional multimodal real-world data across various data modalities on multiple edges while ensuring privacy preservation for road users."
2502.10907,"We consider the three-dimensional time-harmonic electromagnetic (EM) wave scattering transmission problem involving heterogeneous scatterers. The fields are approximated using the local multiple traces formulation (MTF), originally introduced for acoustic scattering. This scheme assigns independent boundary unknowns to each subdomain and weakly enforces Calderón identities along with interface transmission conditions. As a result, the MTF effectively handles shared points or edges among multiple subdomains, while supporting various preconditioning and parallelization strategies. Nevertheless, implementing standard solvers presents significant challenges, particularly in managing the degrees of freedom associated with subdomains and their interfaces. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel framework that suitably defines approximation spaces and enables the efficient exchange of normal vectors across subdomain boundaries. This framework leverages the skeleton mesh, representing the union of all interfaces, as the computational backbone, and constitutes the first scalable implementation of the EM MTF. Furthermore, we conduct several numerical experiments, exploring the effects of increasing subdomains and block On-Surface-Raditation-Condition (OSRC) preconditioning, to validate our approach and provide insights for future developments."
2502.11835,"Building surrogate models with uncertainty quantification capabilities is essential for many engineering applications where randomness, such as variability in material properties, is unavoidable. Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) is widely recognized as a to-go method for constructing stochastic solutions in both intrusive and non-intrusive ways. Its application becomes challenging, however, with complex or high-dimensional processes, as achieving accuracy requires higher-order polynomials, which can increase computational demands and or the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, PCE requires specialized treatments to manage random variables that are not independent, and these treatments may be problem-dependent or may fail with increasing complexity. In this work, we adopt the spectral expansion formalism used in PCE; however, we replace the classical polynomial basis functions with neural network (NN) basis functions to leverage their expressivity. To achieve this, we propose an algorithm that identifies NN-parameterized basis functions in a purely data-driven manner, without any prior assumptions about the joint distribution of the random variables involved, whether independent or dependent. The proposed algorithm identifies each NN-parameterized basis function sequentially, ensuring they are orthogonal with respect to the data distribution. The basis functions are constructed directly on the joint stochastic variables without requiring a tensor product structure. This approach may offer greater flexibility for complex stochastic models, while simplifying implementation compared to the tensor product structures typically used in PCE to handle random vectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through several numerical examples of varying complexity and provide comparisons with classical PCE."
2502.11951,"The development of quantum computers has been the stimulus that enables the realization of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), an area that integrates the calculational framework of quantum mechanics with the adaptive properties of classical machine learning. This article suggests a broad architecture that allows the connection between classical data pipelines and quantum algorithms, hybrid quantum-classical models emerge as a promising route to scalable and near-term quantum benefit. At the core of this paradigm lies the Classical-Quantum (CQ) paradigm, in which the qubit states of high-dimensional classical data are encoded using sophisticated classical encoding strategies which encode the data in terms of amplitude and angle of rotation, along with superposition mapping. These techniques allow compression of information exponentially into Hilbert space representations, which, together with reduced sample complexity, allows greater feature expressivity. We also examine variational quantum circuits, quantum gates expressed as trainable variables that run with classical optimizers to overcome decoherence, noise, and gate-depth constraints of the existing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Experimental comparisons with a Quantum Naive Bayes classifier prove that even small quantum circuits can approximate probabilistic inference with competitive accuracy compared to classical benchmarks, and have much better robustness to noisy data distributionsThis model does not only explain the algorithmic and architectural design of QML, it also offers a roadmap to the implementation of quantum kernels, variational algorithms, and hybrid feedback loops into practice, including optimization, computer vision, and medical diagnostics. The results support the idea that hybrid architectures with strong data encoding and adaptive error protection are key to moving QML out of theory to practice."

Enhancing the operational and financial resilience of power grids against wildfires involves a multifaceted approach. Key proactive measures include meticulous vegetation management, strategic grid hardening such as infrastructure undergrounding, preemptive de-energization, and disaster risk financing, among others. Each measure should be tailored to prioritize efforts in mitigating the consequences of wildfires. This paper proposes a transmission line risk assessment method for grid-ignited wildfires, identifying the transmission lines that could potentially lead to damage to the natural and built environment and to other transmission lines if igniting a wildfire. Grid, meteorological, and topological datasets are combined to enable a comprehensive analysis. Numerical analysis on the standard IEEE 30-bus system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method."

This paper proposes a systematic approach to estimate the potential wildfire ignition damage associated with each transmission line and accordingly offers a priority list for undergrounding. The proposed approach allows electric utilities to make risk-informed decisions for grid modernization and resiliency improvement against wildfires. As a case study, we examine the likelihood of wildfire ignition for each line segment, i.e., between two high-voltage towers, under diverse weather conditions throughout the year. The studies on the standard IEEE 30-bus test system, simulated on 43,712 scenarios, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
2502.12966,"Ethereum has adopted a rollup-centric roadmap to scale by making rollups (layer 2 scaling solutions) the primary method for handling transactions. The first significant step towards this goal was EIP-4844, which introduced blob transactions that are designed to meet the data availability needs of layer 2 protocols. This work constitutes the first rigorous and comprehensive empirical analysis of transaction- and mempool-level data since the institution of blobs on Ethereum on March 13, 2024. We perform a longitudinal study of the early days of the blob fee market analyzing the landscape and the behaviors of its participants. We identify and measure the inefficiencies arising out of suboptimal block packing, showing that at times it has resulted in up to 70% relative fee loss. We hone in and give further insight into two (congested) peak demand periods for blobs. Finally, we document a market design issue relating to subset bidding due to the inflexibility of the transaction structure on packing data as blobs and suggest possible ways to fix it. The latter market structure issue also applies more generally for any discrete objects included within transactions."
2502.1342,"Lyophilization, aka freeze drying, is a process commonly used to increase the stability of various drug products in biotherapeutics manufacturing, e.g., mRNA vaccines, allowing for higher storage temperature. While the current trends in the industry are moving towards continuous manufacturing, the majority of industrial lyophilization processes are still being operated in a batch mode. This article presents a framework that accounts for the probabilistic uncertainty during the primary and secondary drying steps in continuous lyophilization. The probabilistic uncertainty is incorporated into the mechanistic model via polynomial chaos theory (PCT). The resulting PCT-based model is able to accurately and efficiently quantify the effects of uncertainty on several critical process variables, including the temperature, sublimation front, and concentration of bound water. The integration of the PCT-based model into stochastic optimization and control is demonstrated. The proposed framework and case studies can be used to guide the design and control of continuous lyophilization while accounting for probabilistic uncertainty."
2502.13626,"Catalysts are essential for accelerating chemical reactions and enhancing selectivity, which is crucial for the sustainable production of energy, materials, and bioactive compounds. Catalyst discovery is fundamental yet challenging in computational chemistry and has garnered significant attention due to the promising performance of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) notably accelerates progress in the discovery of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, where their chemical reactions differ significantly in material phases, temperature, dynamics, etc. However, there is currently no comprehensive survey that discusses the progress and latest developments in both areas, particularly with the application of LLM techniques. To address this gap, this paper presents a thorough and systematic survey of AI-empowered catalyst discovery, employing a unified and general categorization for homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. We examine the progress of AI-empowered catalyst discovery, highlighting their individual advantages and disadvantages, and discuss the challenges faced in this field. Furthermore, we suggest potential directions for future research from the perspective of computer science.

2502.13675,"Immersed boundary finite element methods allow the user to bypass the potentially troublesome task of boundary-conforming mesh generation. When combined with explicit time integration, poorly cut elements with little support in the physical domain lead to a severely reduced critical time step size, posing a major challenge for immersed wave propagation simulations. The finite cell method stabilizes cut elements by defining the weak form of the problem also in the fictitious domain, but scaled by a small value $\alpha$. This paper investigates the effect of the finite cell method on the critical time step size for explicit time integration. Starting with an analytical one-degree-of-freedom model, we systematically study the influence of $\alpha$-stabilization on the maximum eigenvalue, and thus on the critical time step size, for corner and sliver cuts. The analysis is complemented by a numerical study of an example with one element and increasing polynomial degree, confirming that the critical time step size does not decrease below a certain limit, even as the cut fraction tends to zero. This lower bound is controlled by the choice of $\alpha$. In higher dimensions, sliver cuts are found to be more detrimental than corner cuts, thus determining the minimum critical time step size. Increasing the polynomial degree has only little effect on this degradation. Based on these observations, we derive an estimate of the minimum critical time step size as a function of $\alpha$, which we use to propose a modified CFL condition for the finite cell method. The validity of this condition is demonstrated on a two-dimensional perforated plate example."
2502.14327,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in scientific research, particularly in chemistry-related tasks such as molecular design, reaction prediction, and property estimation. While tool-augmented LLMs have been introduced to enhance reasoning and computation in these domains, existing approaches suffer from tool invocation errors and lack effective collaboration among diverse tools, limiting their overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose ChemHTS (Chemical Hierarchical Tool Stacking), a novel method that optimizes tool invocation pathways through a hierarchical stacking strategy. ChemHTS consists of two key stages: tool self-stacking warmup and multi-layer decision optimization, enabling LLMs to refine tool usage dynamically. We evaluate ChemHTS across four classical chemistry tasks and demonstrate its superiority over strong baselines, including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and chemistry-specific models, including ChemDFM. Furthermore, we define four distinct tool-stacking behaviors to enhance interpretability, providing insights into the effectiveness of tool collaboration.

Accurate real-time forecasting of hydrodynamic processes in these areas is essential for infrastructure planning and climate adaptation. In this study, we present the Multiple-Input Temporal Operator Network (MITONet), a novel autoregressive neural emulator that employs dimensionality reduction to efficiently approximate high-dimensional numerical solvers for complex, nonlinear problems that are governed by time-dependent, parameterized partial differential equations. Although MITONet is applicable to a wide range of problems, we showcase its capabilities by forecasting regional tide-driven dynamics described by the two-dimensional shallow-water equations, while incorporating initial conditions, boundary conditions, and a varying domain parameter.

2502.14897,"Financial Sentiment Analysis (FSA) traditionally relies on human-annotated sentiment labels to infer investor sentiment and forecast market movements. However, inferring the potential market impact of words based on their human-perceived intentions is inherently challenging. We hypothesize that the historical market reactions to words, offer a more reliable indicator of their potential impact on markets than subjective sentiment interpretations by human annotators. To test this hypothesis, a market-derived labeling approach is proposed to assign tweet labels based on ensuing short-term price trends, enabling the language model to capture the relationship between textual signals and market dynamics directly. A domain-specific language model was fine-tuned on these labels, achieving up to an 11% improvement in short-term trend prediction accuracy over traditional sentiment-based benchmarks. Moreover, by incorporating market and temporal context through prompt-tuning, the proposed context-aware language model demonstrated an accuracy of 89.6% on a curated dataset of 227 impactful Bitcoin-related news events with significant market impacts. Aggregating daily tweet predictions into trading signals, our method outperformed traditional fusion models (which combine sentiment-based and price-based predictions). It challenged the assumption that sentiment-based signals are inferior to price-based predictions in forecasting market movements. Backtesting these signals across three distinct market regimes yielded robust Sharpe ratios of up to 5.07 in trending markets and 3.73 in neutral markets. Our findings demonstrate that language models can serve as effective short-term market predictors. This paradigm shift underscores the untapped capabilities of language models in financial decision-making and opens new avenues for market prediction applications."

However, DApps cannot directly access external data and rely on oracles to interact with off-chain data. As a bridge between blockchain and external data sources, oracles pose potential risks of malicious behavior, which may inject incorrect or harmful data, leading to trust and security issues. Additionally, with the surge in data requests, the disparity in oracle trustworthiness and costs has increased, making the dynamic selection of the most suitable oracle for each request a critical challenge. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Trust-Aware and Cost-Optimized Blockchain Oracle Selection Model with Deep Reinforcement Learning (TCO-DRL). The model incorporates a comprehensive trust management mechanism to evaluate oracle reputation from multiple dimensions and employs an improved sliding time window to monitor reputation changes in real time, enhancing resistance to malicious attacks. Moreover, TCO-DRL uses deep reinforcement learning algorithms to dynamically adapt to fluctuations in oracle reputation, ensuring the selection of high-reputation oracles while optimizing node selection, thereby reducing costs without compromising data quality. We implemented and validated TCO- DRL on Ethereum. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, TCO-DRL reduces the allocation rate to malicious oracles by more than 39.10% and saves over 12.00% in costs. Furthermore, simulated experiments on various malicious attacks further validate the robustness and effectiveness of TCO-DRL"
2502.1621,"Understanding the high-order relationship between urban form and function is essential for modeling the underlying mechanisms of sustainable urban systems. Nevertheless, it is challenging to establish an accurate data representation for complex urban forms that are readily explicable in human terms. This study proposed the concept of core urban morphology representation and developed an explainable deep learning framework for explicably symbolizing complex urban forms into the novel representation, which we call CoMo. By interpretating the well-trained deep learning model with a stable weighted F1-score of 89.14%, CoMo presents a promising approach for revealing links between urban function and urban form in terms of core urban morphology representation. Using Boston as a study area, we analyzed the core urban forms at the individual-building, block, and neighborhood level that are important to corresponding urban functions. The residential core forms follow a gradual morphological pattern along the urban spine, which is consistent with a center-urban-suburban transition. Furthermore, we prove that urban morphology directly affects land use efficiency, which has a significantly strong correlation with the location (R2=0.721, p<0.001). Overall, CoMo can explicably symbolize urban forms, provide evidence for the classic urban location theory, and offer mechanistic insights for digital twins."
2502.16224,"The BAT-MCS is an integrated Monte Carlo simulation method (MCS) that combines a binary adaptation tree algorithm (BAT) with a self-regulating simulation mechanism. The BAT algorithm operates deterministically, while the Monte Carlo simulation method is stochastic. By hybridizing these two approaches, BAT-MCS successfully reduces variance, increases efficiency, and improves the quality of its binary-state network reliability. However, it has two notable weaknesses. First, the selection of the supervectors, sub-vectors that form the core of BAT-MCS, is overly simplistic, potentially affecting overall performance. Second, the calculation of the approximate reliability is complicated, which limits its strength in reducing variance. In this study, a new BAT-MCS called cBAT-MCS is proposed to enhance the performance of the BAT-MCS. The approach reduces the complexity of MCS. Selecting the super-vector based on a novel layer-cut approach can reduce both runtime and variance. Extensive numerical experiments on large-scale binary-state network demonstrate that the proposed new cBAT-MCS outperforms traditional MCS and original BAT-MCS approaches in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy."

2502.16752,"The structural integrity of self-piercing rivet (SPR) joints is critical in automotive industries, yet its evaluation poses challenges due to the limitations of traditional destructive methods. This research introduces an innovative approach for non-destructive evaluation using micro-CT imaging, Micro-Computed Tomography, combined with machine vision and deep learning techniques, specifically focusing on automated keypoint estimation to assess joint quality. Recognizing the scarcity of real micro-CT data, this study utilizes synthetic data for initial model training, followed by transfer learning to adapt the model for real-world conditions. A UNet-based architecture is employed to localize three keypoints with precision, enabling the measurement of critical parameters such as head height, interlock, and bottom layer thickness. Extensive validation demonstrates that pre-training on synthetic data, complemented by fine-tuning with limited real data, bridges domain gaps and enhances predictive accuracy. The proposed framework not only offers a scalable and cost-efficient solution for evaluating SPR joints but also establishes a foundation for broader applications of machine vision and non-destructive testing in manufacturing processes. By addressing data scarcity and leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this work represents a significant step toward automated quality control in engineering contexts."
2502.16789,"Alpha mining, a critical component in quantitative investment, focuses on discovering predictive signals for future asset returns in increasingly complex financial markets. However, the pervasive issue of alpha decay, where factors lose their predictive power over time, poses a significant challenge for alpha mining. Traditional methods like genetic programming face rapid alpha decay from overfitting and complexity, while approaches driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their promise, often rely too heavily on existing knowledge, creating homogeneous factors that worsen crowding and accelerate decay. To address this challenge, we propose AlphaAgent, an autonomous framework that effectively integrates LLM agents with ad hoc regularizations for mining decay-resistant alpha factors. AlphaAgent employs three key mechanisms: (i) originality enforcement through a similarity measure based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs) against existing alphas, (ii) hypothesis-factor alignment via LLM-evaluated semantic consistency between market hypotheses and generated factors, and (iii) complexity control via AST-based structural constraints, preventing over-engineered constructions that are prone to overfitting. These mechanisms collectively guide the alpha generation process to balance originality, financial rationale, and adaptability to evolving market conditions, mitigating the risk of alpha decay. Extensive evaluations show that AlphaAgent outperforms traditional and LLM-based methods in mitigating alpha decay across bull and bear markets, consistently delivering significant alpha in Chinese CSI 500 and US S&P 500 markets over the past four years. Notably, AlphaAgent showcases remarkable resistance to alpha decay, elevating the potential for yielding powerful factors."
2502.16828,"Energy landscapes play a crucial role in shaping dynamics of many real-world complex systems. System evolution is often modeled as particles moving on a landscape under the combined effect of energy-driven drift and noise-induced diffusion, where the energy governs the long-term motion of the particles. Estimating the energy landscape of a system has been a longstanding interdisciplinary challenge, hindered by the high operational costs or the difficulty of obtaining supervisory signals. Therefore, the question of how to infer the energy landscape in the absence of true energy values is critical. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed self-supervised learning method to learn the energy landscape from the evolution trajectories of the system. It first maps the system state from the observation space to a discrete landscape space by an adaptive codebook, and then explicitly integrates energy into the graph neural Fokker-Planck equation, enabling the joint learning of energy estimation and evolution prediction. Experimental results across interdisciplinary systems demonstrate that our estimated energy has a correlation coefficient above 0.9 with the ground truth, and evolution prediction accuracy exceeds the baseline by an average of 17.65\%.

This study proposes a rule-based method to support engineers with error detection and correction in P&IDs. The method is based on a graph representation of P&IDs, enabling automated error detection and correction, i.e., autocorrection, through rule graphs. We use our pyDEXPI Python package to generate P&ID graphs from DEXPI-standard P&IDs. In this study, we developed 33 rules based on chemical engineering knowledge and heuristics, with five selected rules demonstrated as examples. A case study on an illustrative P&ID validates the reliability and effectiveness of the rule-based autocorrection method in revising P&IDs."

2502.18834,"Financial time series (FinTS) record the behavior of human-brain-augmented decision-making, capturing valuable historical information that can be leveraged for profitable investment strategies. Not surprisingly, this area has attracted considerable attention from researchers, who have proposed a wide range of methods based on various backbones. However, the evaluation of the area often exhibits three systemic limitations: 1. Failure to account for the full spectrum of stock movement patterns observed in dynamic financial markets. (Diversity Gap), 2. The absence of unified assessment protocols undermines the validity of cross-study performance comparisons. (Standardization Deficit), and 3. Neglect of critical market structure factors, resulting in inflated performance metrics that lack practical applicability. (Real-World Mismatch). Addressing these limitations, we propose FinTSB, a comprehensive and practical benchmark for financial time series forecasting (FinTSF). To increase the variety, we categorize movement patterns into four specific parts, tokenize and pre-process the data, and assess the data quality based on some sequence characteristics. To eliminate biases due to different evaluation settings, we standardize the metrics across three dimensions and build a user-friendly, lightweight pipeline incorporating methods from various backbones. To accurately simulate real-world trading scenarios and facilitate practical implementation, we extensively model various regulatory constraints, including transaction fees, among others. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on FinTSB, highlighting key insights to guide model selection under varying market conditions. Overall, FinTSB provides researchers with a novel and comprehensive platform for improving and evaluating FinTSF methods. The code is available atthis https URL."
2502.1957,"This work proposes a hybrid framework combining classical computers with quantum annealers for structural optimisation. At each optimisation iteration of an iterative process, two minimisation problems are formulated one for the underlying mechanical boundary value problem through the minimisation potential energy principle and one for the minimisation problem to update the design variables. Our hybrid approach leverages the strength of quantum computing to solve these two minimisation problems at each step, thanks to the developed quantum annealing-assisted sequential programming strategy introduced in [Nguyen, Wu, Remacle, and Noels. A quantum annealing-sequential quadratic programming assisted finite element simulation for non-linear and history-dependent mechanical problems. European Journal of Mechanics-A/Solids 105 (2024): 105254]. The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated through several case studies of truss optimisation, highlighting its capability to perform optimisation with quantum computers. The proposed framework offers a promising direction for future structural optimisation applications, particularly in scenarios where the quantum computer could resolve the size limitations of the classical computers due to problem complexities."
2502.19794,"Goal-oriented de novo molecule design, namely generating molecules with specific property or substructure constraints, is a crucial yet challenging task in drug discovery. Existing methods, such as Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning, often require training multiple property predictors and struggle to incorporate substructure constraints. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose ChatMol, a novel approach that leverages LLMs for molecule design across diverse constraint settings. Initially, we crafted a molecule representation compatible with LLMs and validated its efficacy across multiple online LLMs. Afterwards, we developed specific prompts geared towards diverse constrained molecule generation tasks to further fine-tune current LLMs while integrating feedback learning derived from property prediction. Finally, to address the limitations of LLMs in numerical recognition, we referred to the position encoding method and incorporated additional encoding for numerical values within the prompt. Experimental results across single-property, substructure-property, and multi-property constrained tasks demonstrate that ChatMol consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including VAE and RL-based methods. Notably, in multi-objective binding affinity maximization task, ChatMol achieves a significantly lower KD value of 0.25 for the protein target ESR1, while maintaining the highest overall performance, surpassing previous methods by 4.76%. Meanwhile, with numerical enhancement, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the instructed property values and those of the generated molecules increased by up to 0.49. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as a versatile framework for molecule generation, offering a promising alternative to traditional latent space and RL-based approaches."
2502.20343,"Topology optimization produces designs with intricate geometries and complex topologies that require advanced manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing (AM). However, insufficient consideration of manufacturability during the optimization process often results in design modifications that compromise the optimality of the design. While multi-axis AM enhances manufacturability by enabling flexible material deposition in multiple orientations, challenges remain in addressing overhang structures, potential collisions, and material anisotropy caused by varying build orientations. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a novel space-time topology optimization framework for multi-axis AM. The framework employs a pseudo-time field as a design variable to represent the fabrication sequence, simultaneously optimizing the density distribution and build orientations. This approach ensures that the overhang angles remain within manufacturable limits while also mitigating collisions. Moreover, by incorporating material anisotropy induced by diverse build orientations into the design process, the framework can take the scan path-dependent structural behaviors into account during the design optimization. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively derives feasible and optimal designs that account for the manufacturing characteristics of multi-axis AM."

2502.21253,"In this study, we propose a novel approach, termed boundary integrated neural networks (BINNs), for analyzing in-plane crack problems within the framework of linear elastic fracture mechanics. The proposed approach integrates artificial neural networks (ANNs) with classical boundary integral equations (BIEs), enabling an efficient and accurate evaluation of partial differential equations (PDEs) associated with fracture mechanics. Additionally, novel special ANN-based crack-tip elements, the Special crack-tip Neural Networks(SPNNs) are developed to improve the modeling of displacement and stress fields in regions near crack tips. These specialized elements integrate the asymptotic characteristics of fracture mechanics into the neural network framework, ensuring enhanced accuracy in capturing the intricate singularities and steep gradients near the crack tips. Compared to conventional simulation tools in fracture mechanics, the present method offers several distinct advantages. First, by embedding higher-order fracture mechanics principles into the neural networks, the method achieves a more accurate and reliable representation of the near-tip fields, even when using relatively large crack-tip elements. Second, the SPNNs, which incorporates information about varying near-tip singularity orders, improve the method's versatility in solving problems involving complex and diverse crack-tips geometries. Moreover, the method demonstrates excellent computational efficiency due to the dimensionality reduction achieved by employing BIEs.

2503.0018,"This study investigates the Rankine vapor power thermodynamic cycle using steam/water as the working fluid, which is common in commercial power plants for power generation as the source of the rotary shaft power needed to drive electric generators. The four-process cycle version, which comprises a water pump section, a boiler/superheater section, a steam turbine section, and a condenser section, was considered. The performance of this thermodynamic power cycle depends on several design parameters. This study varied a single independent variable, the absolute pressure of the condenser, by a factor of 256, from 0.78125 to 200 kPa. The peak pressure and peak temperature in the cycle were fixed at 50 bar (5,000 kPa) and 600°C, respectively, corresponding to a base case with a base value for the condenser's absolute pressure of 12.5 kPa (0.125 bar). The analysis was performed using the thermodynamics software package Cantera as an extension of the Python programming language. The results suggest that over the range of condenser pressures examined, a logarithmic function can be deployed to describe the dependence of input heat, the net output work, and cycle efficiency on the absolute pressure of the condenser. Each of these three performance metrics decreases as the absolute pressure of the condenser increases. However, a power function is a better choice to describe how the steam dryness (steam quality) at the end of the turbine section increases as the absolute pressure of the condenser rises."
2503.00201,"This paper demonstrates that Automated Market Maker (AMM) based markets, such as those using constant product formulas (e.g., Uniswap), are inherently path-dependent. We prove mathematically that the sequence of operations in AMMs determines the final state, challenging the notion that market prices solely reflect information. This property has profound implications for decentralized prediction markets that rely on AMMs for price discovery, as it demonstrates they cannot function as pure ""truth machines."" Using both mathematical proofs and empirical evidence from ETH/USDC pools, we show that AMM-based markets incorporate historical path information beyond the current market beliefs. Our findings contribute to the understanding of market efficiency, mechanism design, and the interpretation of prices in decentralized finance systems."
2503.00335,"Predicting region-wide structural responses under seismic shaking is essential for enhancing the effectiveness of earthquake engineering task forces such as earthquake early warning and regional seismic risk and resilience assessments. Existing domain-specific and data-driven approaches, however, lack the capability to provide high-fidelity, structure-specific dynamic response predictions for large-scale structural inventories in a timely manner. To address this gap, this study designed a novel deep learning framework, which integrates heterogeneous ground motion sequences and partial structural information as model inputs, to predict structure-specific, probabilistic dynamic responses of regional structural portfolios. Validation on a portfolio of highway bridges in California demonstrates the model's ability to capture inter-structure response variability by inputting critical and accessible bridge parameters while accounting for uncertainties due to the lack of other information. The results underscore the framework's efficiency and accuracy, paving the way for various advancements in performance-based earthquake engineering and regional-scale seismic decision-making."
2503.00575,"Accurate constitutive models of soft materials are crucial for understanding their mechanical behavior and ensuring reliable predictions in the design process. To this end, scientific machine learning research has produced flexible and general material model architectures that can capture the behavior of a wide range of materials, reducing the need for expert-constructed closed-form models. The focus has gradually shifted towards embedding physical constraints in the network architecture to regularize these over-parameterized models. Two popular approaches are input convex neural networks (ICNN) and neural ordinary differential equations (NODE). A related alternative has been the generalization of closed-form models, such as sparse regression from a large library. Remarkably, all prior work using ICNN or NODE uses the invariants of the Cauchy-Green tensor and none uses the principal stretches. In this work, we construct general polyconvex functions of the principal stretches in a physics-aware deep-learning framework and offer insights and comparisons to invariant-based formulations. The framework is based on recent developments to characterize polyconvex functions in terms of convex functions of the right stretch tensor $\mathbf{U}$, its cofactor $\text{cof}\mathbf{U}$, and its determinant $J$. Any convex function of a symmetric second-order tensor can be described with a convex and symmetric function of its eigenvalues. Thus, we first describe convex functions of $\mathbf{U}$ and $\text{cof}\mathbf{U}$ in terms of their respective eigenvalues using deep Holder sets composed with ICNN functions. A third ICNN takes as input $J$ and the two convex functions of $\mathbf{U}$ and $\text{cof}\mathbf{U}$, and returns the strain energy as output. The ability of the model to capture arbitrary materials is demonstrated using synthetic and experimental data."
2503.00738,"Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) have evolved dramatically since the introduction of Automated Market Makers (AMMs). In recent years, solver-based protocols have emerged as an alternative venue aiming to introduce competition for routing, access to offchain liquidity, and thereby improve end-user execution. Currently, these solver auctions are hosted on opaque backends, and the extent of price improvement they provide to end users remains unclear.We conduct an empirical study of the execution welfare that these protocols bring to users by analyzing data across different asset profiles (USDC-WETH and PEPE-WETH). Our results indicate that, compared to vanilla routing through Uniswap V2 or V3, solver-based protocols effectively enhance execution welfare for end users on DEXes within certain trade size ranges. This effect is most pronounced with USDC-WETH, a short-tail asset, and somewhat less significant with PEPE-WETH, a long-tail asset.Additionally, we identify execution welfare discrepancies across solver-based platforms (e.g., CoWSwap, 1inchFusion, UniswapX), revealing potential inefficiencies due to solver market structure, variations in liquidity profile and inventory depth among solvers. These insights highlight both the advantages and challenges of solver-based trading, underscoring its role in improving execution outcomes while raising concerns about market concentration and competition dynamics."
2503.00814,"In numerical simulation, structured mesh generation often requires a lot of time and manpower investment. The general scheme for structured quad mesh generation is to find a mapping between the computational domain and the physical domain. This mapping can be obtained by solving partial differential equations. However, existing structured mesh generation methods are difficult to ensure both efficiency and mesh quality. In this paper, we propose a structured mesh generation method based on physics-informed neural network, PINN-MG. It takes boundary curves as input and then utilizes an attention network to capture the potential mapping between computational and physical domains, generating structured meshes for the input physical domain. PINN-MG introduces the Navier-Lamé equation in linear elastic as a partial differential equation term in the loss function, ensuring that the neural network conforms to the law of elastic body deformation when optimizing the loss value. The training process of PINN-MG is completely unsupervised and does not require any prior knowledge or datasets, which greatly reduces the previous workload of producing structured mesh datasets. Experimental results show that PINN-MG can generate higher quality structured quad meshes than other methods, and has the advantages of traditional algebraic methods and differential methods."

Efficient and accurate biophysical simulations rely on high-quality personalized computational meshes derived from patient's segmented anatomical MRI scans. However, both automatic and manual segmentation are particularly challenging for tissues with limited visibility or low contrast. In this work, we present a new method to create personalized computational meshes of the brain, streamlining the development of computational brain models for clinical applications and neuroscience research. Our method uses SynthMorph, a state-of-the-art anatomy-aware, learning-based medical image registration approach, to morph a comprehensive hexahedral mesh of the open-source SPL/NAC Brain Atlas to patient-specific MRI scans. Each patient-specific mesh includes over 300 labeled anatomical structures, more than any existing manual or automatic methods. Our registration-based method takes approximately 20 minutes, significantly faster than current state-of-the-art mesh generation pipelines, which can take up to two hours. We evaluated several state-of-the-art medical image registration methods, including SynthMorph, to determine the most optimal registration method to morph our meshed anatomical brain atlas to patient MRI scans. Our results demonstrate that SynthMorph achieved high DICE similarity coefficients and low Hausdorff Distance metrics between anatomical structures, while maintaining high mesh element quality. These findings demonstrate that our registration-based method efficiently and accurately produces high-quality, comprehensive personalized brain meshes, representing an important step toward clinical translation."

2503.01765,"Prediction of hydrogen embrittlement requires a robust modelling approach and this will foster the safe adoption of hydrogen as a clean energy vector. A generalised computational model for hydrogen embrittlement is here presented, based on a phase field description of fracture.

2503.02041,"Deep learning has been extensively employed as a powerful function approximator for modeling physics-based problems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their popularity, standard deep learning models often demand prohibitively large computational resources and yield limited accuracy when scaling to large-scale, high-dimensional physical problems. Their black-box nature further hinders the application in industrial problems where interpretability and high precision are critical. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Interpolating Neural Network-Tensor Decomposition (INN-TD), a scalable and interpretable framework that has the merits of both machine learning and finite element methods for modeling large-scale physical systems. By integrating locally supported interpolation functions from finite element into the network architecture, INN-TD achieves a sparse learning structure with enhanced accuracy, faster training/solving speed, and reduced memory footprint. This makes it particularly effective for tackling large-scale high-dimensional parametric PDEs in training, solving, and inverse optimization tasks in physical problems where high precision is required."
2503.02061,"The front-capturing Level-Set (LS) method is widely employed in academia and industry to model grain boundary (GB) migration during the microstructure evolution of polycrystalline materials under thermo-mechanical treatments. During capillarity-driven grain growth, the conventional mean curvature flow equation, $\vec{v} = - \mu \gamma \kappa \vec{n}$, is used to compute the GB normal migration velocity.

This work introduces a Python-based algorithm that automates the generation of reaction templates for the LAMMPS REACTION package, leveraging graph-theoretical principles and sub-graph isomorphism techniques. By representing molecular systems as mathematical graphs, the method enables automated identification of conserved molecular domains, reaction sites, and atom mappings, significantly reducing manual effort. The algorithm was validated on three case studies: poly-addition, poly-condensation, and chain polymerization, demonstrating its ability to map conserved regions, identify reaction-initiating atoms, and resolve challenges such as symmetric reactants and indistinguishable atoms. Additionally, the generated templates were optimized for computational efficiency by retaining only essential reactive domains, ensuring scalability and consistency in high-throughput workflows for computational chemistry, materials science, and machine learning applications. Future work will focus on extending the method to mixed organic-inorganic systems, incorporating adaptive scoring mechanisms, and integrating quantum mechanical calculations to enhance its applicability."
2503.0269,"Motivated by the pursuit of safe, reliable, and weather-tolerant urban air mobility (UAM) solutions, this work proposes a generative modeling approach for characterizing microweather wind velocities. Microweather, or the weather conditions in highly localized areas, is particularly complex in urban environments owing to the chaotic and turbulent nature of wind flows. Furthermore, traditional means of assessing local wind fields are not generally viable solutions for UAM applications: 1) field measurements that would rely on permanent wind profiling systems in operational air space are not practical, 2) physics-based models that simulate fluid dynamics at a sufficiently high resolution are not computationally tractable, and 3) data-driven modeling approaches that are largely deterministic ignore the inherent variability in turbulent flows that dictates UAM reliability. Thus, advancements in predictive capabilities are needed to help mitigate the unique operational safety risks that microweather winds pose for smaller, lighter weight UAM aircraft.This work aims to model microweather wind velocities in a manner that is computationally-efficient, captures random variability, and would only require a temporary, rather than permanent, field measurement campaign. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in conditional generative AI such as text-to-image generation, the proposed approach learns a probabilistic macro-to-microweather mapping between regional weather forecasts and measured local wind velocities using generative modeling (denoising diffusion probabilistic models, flow matching, and Gaussian mixture models). A simple proof of concept was implemented using a dataset comprised of local (micro) measurements from a Sonic Detection and Ranging (SoDAR) wind profiler along with (macro) forecast data from a nearby weather station over the same time period."

To address hallucinations in LLMs, FinArena employs the adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generative (RAG) method for processing unstructured news data. Finally, a universal expert agent makes investment decisions based on the features extracted from multimodal data and investors' individual risk preferences. Extensive experiments show that FinArena surpasses both traditional and state-of-the-art benchmarks in stock trend prediction and yields promising results in trading simulations across various risk profiles. These findings highlight FinArena's potential to enhance investment outcomes by aligning strategic insights with personalized risk considerations."
2503.02771,"This thesis presents a novel framework for analysing the societal impacts of armed conflict by applying principles from engineering and material science. Building on the idea of a ""social fabric"", it recasts communities as plates with properties, such as resilience and vulnerability, analogous to material parameters like thickness or elasticity. Conflict events are treated as external forces that deform this fabric, revealing how repeated shocks and local weaknesses can compound over time. Using a custom Python-based Finite Element Analysis implementation, the thesis demonstrates how data on socioeconomic indicators (e.g., infrastructure, health, and demographics) and conflict incidents can be translated into a single computational model. Preliminary tests validate that results align with expected physical behaviours, and a proof-of-concept highlights how this approach can capture indirect or spillover effects and illuminate the areas most at risk of long-term harm. By bridging social science insights with computational modelling, this work offers an adaptable frame to inform both academic research and on-the-ground policy decisions for communities affected by violence."
2503.03165,"With the rapid growth of online investment platforms, funds can be distributed to individual customers online. The central issue is to match funds with potential customers under constraints. Most mainstream platforms adopt the recommendation formulation to tackle the problem. However, the traditional recommendation regime has its inherent drawbacks when applying the fund-matching problem with multiple constraints. In this paper, we model the fund matching under the allocation formulation. We design PTOFA, a Predict-Then-Optimize Fund Allocation framework. This data-driven framework consists of two stages, i.e., prediction and optimization, which aim to predict expected revenue based on customer behavior and optimize the impression allocation to achieve the maximum revenue under the necessary constraints, respectively. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets from an industrial online investment platform validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution. Additionally, the online A/B tests demonstrate PTOFA's effectiveness in the real-world fund recommendation scenario."
2503.03372,"The commutation angle is defined as the angle between the fundamental of the motor phase current and the fundamental of the back-EMF. It can be utilised to provide a compensating effect in IPMSMs. This is due to the reluctance torque component being dependent on the commutation angle of the phase current even before entering the extended speed range. A real-time maximum torque per current and voltage strategy is demonstrated to find the trajectory and optimum commutation angles, gamma, where the level of accuracy depends on the application and available computational speed. A magnet volume reduction using a novel multi-criteria local Latin hypercube refinement (MLHR) sampling system is also presented to improve the optimisation process. The proposed new technique minimises the magnet mass to motor torque density whilst maintaining a similar phase current level. A mapping of gamma allows the determination of the optimum angles, as shown in this paper. The 3rd generation Toyota Prius IPMSM is considered as the reference motor, where the rotor configuration is altered to allow for an individual assessment."
2503.03706,"In recent years, human in silico trials have gained significant traction as a powerful approach to evaluate the effects of drugs, clinical interventions, and medical devices. In silico trials not only minimise patient risks but also reduce reliance on animal testing. However, the implementation of in silico trials presents several time-consuming challenges. It requires the creation of large cohorts of virtual patients. Each virtual patient is described by their anatomy with a volumetric mesh and electrophysiological and mechanical dynamics through mathematical equations and parameters. Furthermore, simulated conditions need definition including stimulation protocols and therapy evaluation. For large virtual cohorts, this requires automatic and efficient pipelines for generation of corresponding files. In this work, we present a computational pipeline to automatically create large virtual patient cohort files to conduct large-scale in silico trials through cardiac electromechanical simulations. The pipeline generates the files describing meshes, labels, and data required for the simulations directly from unprocessed surface meshes. We applied the pipeline to generate over 100 virtual patients from various datasets and performed simulations to demonstrate capacity to conduct in silico trials for virtual patients using verified and validated electrophysiology and electromechanics models for the context of use. The proposed pipeline is adaptable to accommodate different types of ventricular geometries and mesh processing tools, ensuring its versatility in handling diverse clinical datasets. By establishing an automated framework for large scale simulation studies as required for in silico trials and providing open-source code, our work aims to support scalable, personalised cardiac simulations in research and clinical applications."
2503.04039,"This paper designs a high-order positivity-preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for a linear hyperbolic equation. The scheme relies on augmenting the standard polynomial DG spaces with additional basis functions. The purpose of these augmented basis functions is to ensure the preservation of a positive cell average for the unmodulated DG solution. As such, the simple Zhang and Shu limiter~\cite{zhang2010maximum} can be applied with no loss of accuracy for smooth solutions, and the cell average remains unaltered. A key feature of the proposed scheme is its implicit generation of suitable augmented basis functions. Nonlinear optimization facilitates the design of these augmented basis functions. Several benchmarks and computational studies demonstrate that the method works well in two and three dimensions. \keywords{discontinuous Galerkin \and High-order \and Positivity-preserving"
2503.04061,"We present a high-order hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the numerical solution of time-dependent three-phase flow in heterogeneous porous media. The underlying algorithm is a semi-implicit operator splitting approach that relaxes the nonlinearity present in the governing equations. By treating the subsequent equations implicitly, we obtain solution that remain stable for large time steps. The hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method allows for static condensation, which significantly reduces the total number of degrees of freedom, especially when compared to classical discontinuous Galerkin methods. Several numerical tests are given, for example, we verify analytic convergence rates for the method, as well as examine its robustness in both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media."

2503.05387,"The accurate modeling of the mechanical behavior of rubber-like materials under multi-axial loading constitutes a long-standing challenge in hyperelastic material modeling. This work employs deep symbolic regression as an interpretable machine learning approach to discover novel strain energy functions directly from experimental results, with a specific focus on the classical Treloar and Kawabata data sets for vulcanized rubber. The proposed approach circumvents traditional human model selection biases by exploring possible functional forms of strain energy functions, expressed in terms of both the first and second principal invariants of the right Cauchy-Green tensor. The resulting models exhibit high predictive accuracy for various deformation modes, including uniaxial tension, pure shear, equal biaxial tension, and biaxial loading. This work underscores the potential of deep symbolic regression in advancing hyperelastic material modeling and highlights the importance of considering both invariants in capturing the complex behaviors of rubber-like materials."

2503.06109,"Efficient and adaptive course timetabling for large, dynamic university campuses remains a significant challenge due to the complex interplay of hard and soft constraints. Traditional static optimization methods often fail to accommodate real-time disruptions, evolving user preferences, and the nuanced spatial-temporal relationships inherent in campus environments. This paper reconceptualizes the timetabling problem as a recommendation-based task and leverages the Texas A&M Campus Digital Twin as a dynamic data platform. Our proposed framework integrates collaborative and content-based filtering techniques with iterative feedback mechanisms, thereby generating a ranked set of adaptive timetable recommendations. A composite scoring function, incorporating metrics for classroom occupancy, travel distance, travel time, and vertical transitions, enables the framework to systematically balance resource utilization with user-centric factors. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Texas A&M University demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces travel inefficiencies, optimizes classroom utilization, and enhances overall user satisfaction. By coupling a recommendation-oriented paradigm with a digital twin environment, this study offers a robust and scalable blueprint for intelligent campus planning and resource allocation, with potential applications in broader urban contexts."
2503.06441,"Company financial risks pose a significant threat to personal wealth and national economic stability, stimulating increasing attention towards the development of efficient andtimely methods for monitoring them. Current approaches tend to use graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the momentum spillover effect of risks. However, due to the black-box nature of GNNs, these methods leave much to be improved for precise and reliable explanations towards company risks. In this paper, we propose CF3, a novel Counterfactual and Factual learning method for company Financial risk detection, which generates evidence subgraphs on company knowledge graphs to reliably detect and explain company financial risks. Specifically, we first propose a meta-path attribution process based on Granger causality, selecting the meta-paths most relevant to the target node labels to construct an attribution subgraph. Subsequently, we propose anedge-type-aware graph generator to identify important edges, and we also devise a layer-based feature masker to recognize crucial node features. Finally, we utilize counterfactual-factual reasoning and a loss function based on attribution subgraphs to jointly guide the learning of the graph generator and feature masker. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in the field of financial risk detection."
2503.06533,"Over the past decades, the performance design of closed-chain legged mechanisms (CLMs) has not been adequately addressed. Most existing design methodologies have predominantly relied on trajectory synthesis, which inadvertently prioritizes less critical performance aspects. This study proposes a hierarchical multi-objective optimization strategy to address this limitation. First, the numerical performance-trajectory mapping is derived based on a foot-ground contact model, aiming to decouple the performance characteristics. Subsequently, a hierarchical optimization strategy is employed for two CLM design scenarios: In trajectory shape-constrained scenarios, a coarse-to-fine optimization process, integrating Fourier descriptors, refines the design from overall shape to local features. In scenarios without trajectory shape constraints, a stepwise optimization process is proposed for reconfigurable CLMs to transition from primary motion to auxiliary motion. The robustness of the proposed design strategy is validated across three configurations and seven algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed design strategy is verified by comparison with other existing CLM design methods. The applicability of the proposed strategy is confirmed through simulation and prototype experiments. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical strategy effectively addresses the challenges of precise performance design in CLMs. Our work provides a general framework for the CLM design and offers insights for the optimization design of other closed-chain linkages."
2503.06663,"Deep neural network (DNN) inference in energy harvesting (EH) devices poses significant challenges due to resource constraints and frequent power interruptions. These power losses not only increase end-to-end latency, but also compromise inference consistency and accuracy, as existing checkpointing and restore mechanisms are prone to errors. Consequently, the quality of service (QoS) for DNN inference on EH devices is severely impacted. In this paper, we propose an energy-adaptive DNN inference mechanism capable of dynamically transitioning the model into a low-power mode by reducing computational complexity when harvested energy is limited. This approach ensures that end-to-end latency requirements are met. Additionally, to address the limitations of error-prone checkpoint-and-restore mechanisms, we introduce a checkpoint-free intermittent inference framework that ensures consistent, progress-preserving DNN inference during power failures in energy-harvesting systems."
2503.06769,"This paper proposes an innovative solution to the growing issue of greenhouse gas emissions: a closed photobioreactor (PBR) façade system to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. With digital fabrication technology, this study explores the transition from traditional, single function building facades to multifunctional, integrated building systems. It introduces a photobioreactor (PBR) façade system to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations while addressing the challenge of large-scale prefabricated components transportation.

2503.06774,"This paper explores the production of a specified object using a combination of machining processes, including milling, shaping, and drilling, while emphasizing the critical role of fixture design in ensuring precision repeatability, and efficiency. The study outlines the systematic approach to transforming raw materials into a finished product through an optimized manufacturing sequence that minimizes waste and maximizes productivity. Different machining operations are carefully selected based on their suitability for achieving the required dimensional accuracy and surface finish.

2503.0715,"We propose a novel approach to the analysis of programmable geometrically exact shear deformable beam systems made of shape memory polymers. The proposed method combines the viscoelastic Generalized Maxwell model with the Williams, Landel and Ferry relaxation principle, enabling the reproduction of the shape memory effect of structural systems featuring complex geometry and topology. Very high efficiency is pursued by discretizing the differential problem in space through the isogeometric collocation (IGA-C) method. The method, in addition to the desirable attributes of isogeometric analysis (IGA), such as exactness of the geometric reconstruction of complex shapes and high-order accuracy, circumvents the need for numerical integration since it discretizes the problem in the strong form. Other distinguishing features of the proposed formulation are: i) ${\rm SO}(3)$-consistency for the linearization of the problem and for the time stepping; ii) minimal (finite) rotation parametrization, that means only three rotational unknowns are used; iii) no additional unknowns are needed to account for the rate-dependent material compared to the purely elastic case. Through different numerical applications involving challenging initial geometries, we show that the proposed formulation possesses all the sought attributes in terms of programmability of complex systems, geometric flexibility, and high order accuracy."
2503.07231,"In today's globalised trade, supply chains form complex networks spanning multiple organisations and even countries, making them highly vulnerable to disruptions. These vulnerabilities, highlighted by recent global crises, underscore the urgent need for improved visibility and resilience of the supply chain. However, data-sharing limitations often hinder the achievement of comprehensive visibility between organisations or countries due to privacy, security, and regulatory concerns. Moreover, most existing research studies focused on individual firm- or product-level networks, overlooking the multifaceted interactions among diverse entities that characterise real-world supply chains, thus limiting a holistic understanding of supply chain dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) to enhance supply chain visibility through relationship prediction in supply chain knowledge graphs. FL enables collaborative model training across countries by facilitating information sharing without requiring raw data exchange, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and maintaining data security. GCNs empower the framework to capture intricate relational patterns within knowledge graphs, enabling accurate link prediction to uncover hidden connections and provide comprehensive insights into supply chain networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict relationships within country-level supply chain knowledge graphs. This enhanced visibility supports actionable insights, facilitates proactive risk management, and contributes to the development of resilient and adaptive supply chain strategies, ensuring that supply chains are better equipped to navigate the complexities of the global economy."

2503.07462,"Bearings are critical components in industrial machinery, yet their vulnerability to faults often leads to costly breakdowns. Conventional fault detection methods depend on continuous, high-frequency vibration sensing, digitising, and wireless transmission to the cloud-an approach that significantly drains the limited energy reserves of battery-powered sensors, accelerating their depletion and increasing maintenance costs. This work proposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous vibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to specific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as the key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the machinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital conversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the sensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach, we use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets, examining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also consider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices, and the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested energy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and severities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a diagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance strategy for fault detection in smart machinery."
2503.07834,"The Uniswap is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) protocol that facilitates automatic token exchange without the need for traditional order books. Every pair of tokens forms a liquidity pool on Uniswap, and each token can be paired with any other token to create liquidity pools. This characteristic motivates us to employ a complex network approach to analyze the features of the Uniswap market. This research presents a comprehensive analysis of the Uniswap network using complex network methods. The network on October 31, 2023, is built to observe its recent features, showcasing both scale-free and core-periphery properties. By employing node and edge-betweenness metrics, we detect the most important tokens and liquidity pools. Additionally, we construct daily networks spanning from the beginning of Uniswap V2 on May 5, 2020, until October 31, 2023, and our findings demonstrate that the network becomes increasingly fragile over time. Furthermore, we conduct a robustness analysis by simulating the deletion of nodes to estimate the impact of some extreme events such as the Terra collapse. The results indicate that the Uniswap network exhibits robustness, yet it is notably fragile when deleting tokens with high betweenness centrality. This finding highlights that, despite being a decentralized exchange, Uniswap exhibits significant centralization tendencies in terms of token network connectivity and the distribution of TVL across nodes (tokens) and edges (liquidity pools)."
2503.08953,"Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a powerful tool to facilitate monitoring, control, and other decision-making tasks in real-world engineering systems. Online update methods have been proposed to update DT models. Considering the degradation behavior in the system lifecycle, these methods fail to enable DT models to predict the system responses affected by the system degradation over time. To alleviate this problem, degradation models of measurable parameters have been integrated into DT construction. However, identifying the degradation parameters relies on prior knowledge of the system and expensive experiments. To mitigate those limitations, this paper proposes a lifelong update method for DT models to capture the effects of system degradation on system responses without any prior knowledge and expensive offline experiments on the system. The core idea in the work is to represent the system degradation during the lifecycle as the dynamic changes of DT configurations (i.e., model parameters with a fixed model structure) at all degradation stages. During the lifelong update process, an Autoencoder is adopted to reconstruct the model parameters of all hidden layers simultaneously, so that the latent features taking into account the dependencies among hidden layers are obtained for each degradation stage. The dynamic behavior of latent features among successive degradation stages is then captured by a long short-term memory model, which enables prediction of the latent feature at any unseen stage. Based on the predicted latent features, the model configuration at future degradation stage is reconstructed to determine the new DT model, which predicts the system responses affected by the degradation at the same stage. The test results on two engineering datasets demonstrate that the proposed update method could capture effects of system degradation on system responses during the lifecycle."

2503.09655,"Traditional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are effective for handling sequential data but have limitations such as gradient vanishing and difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies, which can impact their performance in dynamic and risky environments like stock trading.

Our proposed method utilizes xLSTM networks in both actor and critic components, enabling effective handling of time series data and dynamic market environments. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation, is employed to optimize the trading strategy. Experiments were conducted using financial data from major tech companies over a comprehensive timeline, demonstrating that the xLSTM-based model outperforms LSTM-based methods in key trading evaluation metrics, including cumulative return, average profitability per trade, maximum earning rate, maximum pullback, and Sharpe ratio. These findings mark the potential of xLSTM for enhancing DRL-based stock trading systems."
2503.10285,"Accurate prediction of expected concentrations is essential for effective catchment management, requiring both extensive monitoring and advanced modeling techniques. However, due to limitations in the equation solving capacity, the integration of monitoring and modeling has been suffering suboptimal statistical approaches. This limitation results in models that can only partially leverage monitoring data, thus being an obstacle for realistic uncertainty assessments by overlooking critical correlations between both measurements and model parameters. This study presents a novel solution that integrates catchment monitoring and a unified hieratical statistical catchment modeling that employs a log-normal distribution for residuals within a left-censored likelihood function to address measurements below detection limits. This enables the estimation of concentrations within sub-catchments in conjunction with a source/fate sub-catchment model and monitoring data. This approach is possible due to a model builder R package denoted RTMB. The proposed approach introduces a statistical paradigm based on a hierarchical structure, capable of accommodating heterogeneous sampling across various sampling locations and the authors suggest that this also will encourage further refinement of other existing modeling platforms within the scientific community to improve synergy with monitoring programs. The application of the method is demonstrated through an analysis of nickel concentrations in Danish surface waters."
2503.11292,"As a mesh-free method, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has been widely used for modeling and simulating fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. While the kernel gradient correction (KGC) method is commonly applied in structural domains to enhance numerical consistency, high-order consistency corrections that preserve conservation remain underutilized in fluid domains despite their critical role in FSI analysis, especially for the multi-resolution scheme where fluid domains generally have a low resolution. In this study, we incorporate the reverse kernel gradient correction (RKGC) formulation, a conservative high-order consistency approximation, into the fluid discretization for solving FSI problems. RKGC has been proven to achieve exact second-order convergence with relaxed particles and improve numerical accuracy while particularly enhancing energy conservation in free-surface flow simulations. By integrating this correction into the Riemann SPH method to solve different typical FSI problems with a multi-resolution scheme, numerical results consistently show improvements in accuracy and convergence compared to uncorrected fluid discretization. Despite these advances, further refinement of correction techniques for solid domains and fluid-structure interfaces remains significant for enhancing the overall accuracy of SPH-based FSI modeling and simulation."
2503.11826,"The Adiabatic Flame Temperature (AFT) in combustion represents the maximum attainable temperature at which the chemical energy in the reactant fuel is converted into sensible heat in combustion products without heat loss. AFT depends on the fuel, oxidizer, and chemical composition of the products. Computing AFT requires solving either a nonlinear equation or a larger minimization problem. This study obtained the AFTs for oxy-methane (methane and oxygen), oxy-hydrogen (hydrogen and oxygen), air-methane (methane and air), and air-hydrogen (hydrogen and air) for stoichiometric conditions. The reactant temperature was 298.15 K (25°C), and the pressure was kept constant at 1 atm. Two reaction mechanisms were attempted: a global single-step irreversible reaction for complete combustion and the GRI-Mech 3.0 elementary mechanism (53 species, 325 steps) for chemical equilibrium with its associated thermodynamic data. NASA CEARUN was the main modeling tool used. Two other tools were used for benchmarking: an Excel and a Cantera-Python implementation of GRI-Mech 3.0. The results showed that the AFTs for oxy-methane were 5,166.47 K (complete combustion) and 3,050.12 K (chemical equilibrium), and dropped to 2,326.35 K and 2,224.25 K for air-methane, respectively. The AFTs for oxy-hydrogen were 4,930.56 K (complete combustion) and 3,074.51 K (chemical equilibrium), and dropped to 2,520.33 K and 2,378.62 K for air-hydrogen, respectively. For eight combustion modeling cases, the relative deviation between the AFTs predicted by CEARUN and GRI-Mech 3.0 ranged from 0.064% to 3.503%."
2503.12467,"The aim of this work is to further expand the capability of the coarse-grid Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach, SubChCFD, to effectively simulate transient and buoyancy-influenced flows, which are critical in accident analyses of High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs). It has been demonstrated in our previous work that SubChCFD is highly adaptable to HTGR fuel designs and performs exceptionally well in modelling steady-state processes. In this study, the approach is extended to simulate a Loss of Flow Accident (LOFA) transient, where coolant circulation is disrupted, causing the transition from forced convection to buoyancy-driven natural circulation within the reactor core. To enable SubChCFD to capture the complex physics involved, corrections were introduced to the empirical correlations to account for the effects of flow unsteadiness, property variation and buoyancy.A 1/12th sector of the reactor core, representing the smallest symmetric unit, was modelled using a coarse mesh of approximately 60 million cells. This mesh size is about 6% of that required for a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model, where mesh sizes can typically reach the order of 1 billion cells for such configurations. Simulation results show that SubChCFD effectively captures the thermal hydraulic behaviours of the reactor during a LOFA transient, producing predictions in good agreement with RANS simulations while significantly reducing computational cost."
2503.12481,"Iceberg calving at glacier termini results in mass loss from ice sheets, but the associated fracture mechanics is often poorly represented using simplistic (empirical or elementary mechanics-based) failure criteria. Here, we propose an advanced Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion that drives cracking based on the visco-elastic stress state in ice. This criterion is implemented in a phase field fracture framework, and finite element simulations are conducted to determine the critical conditions that can trigger ice cliff collapse. Results demonstrate that fast-moving glaciers with negligible basal friction are prone to tensile failure causing crevasse propagation far away from the ice front; whilst slow-moving glaciers with significant basal friction are likely to exhibit shear failure near the ice front. Results also indicate that seawater pressure plays a major role in modulating cliff failure. For land terminating glaciers, full thickness cliff failure is observed if the glacier exceeds a critical height, dependent on cohesive strength $\tau_\mathrm{c}$ ($H \approx 120\;\text{m}$ for $\tau_\mathrm{c}=0.5\;\text{MPa}$). For marine-terminating glaciers, ice cliff failure occurs if a critical glacier free-board ($H-h_\mathrm{w}$) is exceeded, with ice slumping only observed above the ocean-water height; for $\tau_\mathrm{c} = 0.5\;\text{MPa}$, the model-predicted critical free-board is $H-h_\mathrm{w} \approx 215\;\text{m}$, which is in good agreement with field observations. While the critical free-board height is larger than that predicted by some previous models, we cannot conclude that marine ice cliff instability is less likely because we do not include other failure processes such as hydrofracture of basal crevasses and plastic necking."
2503.12679,"When characterizing materials, it can be important to not only predict their mechanical properties, but also to estimate the probability distribution of these properties across a set of samples. Constitutive neural networks allow for the automated discovery of constitutive models that exactly satisfy physical laws given experimental testing data, but are only capable of predicting the mean stress response. Stochastic methods treat each weight as a random variable and are capable of learning their probability distributions. Bayesian constitutive neural networks combine both methods, but their weights lack physical interpretability and we must sample each weight from a probability distribution to train or evaluate the model. Here we introduce a more interpretable network with fewer parameters, simpler training, and the potential to discover correlated weights: Gaussian constitutive neural networks. We demonstrate the performance of our new Gaussian network on biaxial testing data, and discover a sparse and interpretable four-term model with correlated weights. Importantly, the discovered distributions of material parameters across a set of samples can serve as priors to discover better constitutive models for new samples with limited data. We anticipate that Gaussian constitutive neural networks are a natural first step towards generative constitutive models informed by physical laws and parameter uncertainty."
2503.12828,"Underwater video analysis, hampered by the dynamic marine environment and camera motion, remains a challenging task in computer vision. Existing training-free video generation techniques, learning motion dynamics on the frame-by-frame basis, often produce poor results with noticeable motion interruptions and misaligments. To address these issues, we propose AUTV, a framework for synthesizing marine video data with pixel-wise annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by constructing two video datasets, namely UTV, a real-world dataset comprising 2,000 video-text pairs, and SUTV, a synthetic video dataset including 10,000 videos with segmentation masks for marine objects. UTV provides diverse underwater videos with comprehensive annotations including appearance, texture, camera intrinsics, lighting, and animal behavior. SUTV can be used to improve underwater downstream tasks, which are demonstrated in video inpainting and video object segmentation."
2503.1301,"Foil windings have, due to their layered structure, different properties than conventional wire windings, which make them advantageous for high frequency applications. Both electromagnetic and thermal analyses are relevant for foil windings. These two physical areas are coupled through Joule losses and temperature dependent material properties. For an efficient simulation of foil windings, homogenization techniques are used to avoid resolving the single turns. Therefore, this paper comprises a coupled magneto-thermal simulation that uses a homogenization method in the electromagnetic and thermal part. A weak coupling with different time step sizes for both parts is presented. The method is verified on a simple geometry and showcased for a pot transformer that uses a foil and a wire winding."
2503.13717,"In this work we define, analyze, and compare different numerical schemes that can be used to study the ground state properties of Bose-Fermi systems, such as mixtures of different atomic species under external forces or self-bound quantum droplets. The bosonic atoms are assumed to be condensed and are described by the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The fermionic atoms, on the other hand, are treated individually, and each atom is associated with a wave function whose evolution follows the Hartree-Fock equation. We solve such a formulated set of equations using a variety of methods, including those based on adiabatic switching of interactions and the imaginary time propagation technique combined with the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization or the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix. We show how different algorithms compete at the numerical level by studying the mixture in the range of parameters covering the formation of self-bound quantum Bose-Fermi droplets."
2503.13933,"A data-free, predictive scientific AI model, Tensor-decomposition-based A Priori Surrogate (TAPS), is proposed for tackling ultra large-scale engineering simulations with significant speedup, memory savings, and storage gain. TAPS can effectively obtain surrogate models for high-dimensional parametric problems with equivalent zetta-scale ($10^{21}$) degrees of freedom (DoFs). TAPS achieves this by directly obtaining reduced-order models through solving governing equations with multiple independent variables such as spatial coordinates, parameters, and time. The paper first introduces an AI-enhanced finite element-type interpolation function called convolution hierarchical deep-learning neural network (C-HiDeNN) with tensor decomposition (TD). Subsequently, the generalized space-parameter-time Galerkin weak form and the corresponding matrix form are derived. Through the choice of TAPS hyperparameters, an arbitrary convergence rate can be achieved. To show the capabilities of this framework, TAPS is then used to simulate a large-scale additive manufacturing process as an example and achieves around 1,370x speedup, 14.8x memory savings, and 955x storage gain compared to the finite difference method with $3.46$ billion spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). As a result, the TAPS framework opens a new avenue for many challenging ultra large-scale engineering problems, such as additive manufacturing and integrated circuit design, among others."
2503.16211,"Revolutionary advances in both manufacturing and computational morphogenesis raise critical questions about design sensitivity. Sensitivity questions are especially critical in contexts, such as topology optimization, that yield structures with emergent morphology. However, analyzing emergent structures via conventional, perturbative techniques can mask larger-scale vulnerabilities that could manifest in essential components. Risks that fail to appear in perturbative sensitivity analyses will only continue to proliferate as topology optimization-driven manufacturing penetrates more deeply into engineering design and consumer products. Here, we introduce Laplace-transform based computational filters that supplement computational morphogenesis with a set of nonperturbative sensitivity analyses. We demonstrate how this approach identifies important elements of a structure even in the absence of knowledge of the ultimate, optimal structure itself. We leverage techniques from molecular dynamics and implement these methods in open-source codes, demonstrating their application to compliance minimization problems in both 2D and 3D. Our implementation extends straightforwardly to topology optimization for other problems and benefits from the strong scaling properties observed in conventional molecular simulation."
2503.16407,"Deep Feynman-Kac method was first introduced to solve parabolic partial differential equations(PDE) by Beck et al. (SISC, V.43, 2021), named Deep Splitting method since they trained the Neural Networks step by step in the time direction. In this paper, we propose a new training approach with two different features. Firstly, neural networks are trained at all time steps globally, instead of step by step. Secondly, the training data are generated in a new way, in which the method is consistent with a direct Monte Carlo scheme when dealing with a linear parabolic PDE. Numerical examples show that our method has significant improvement both in efficiency and accuracy."
2503.17151,"Developing clinically viable tissue-engineered cardiovascular implants remains a formidable challenge. Achieving reliable and durable outcomes requires a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms driving tissue evolution during in vitro maturation. Although considerable progress has been made in modeling soft tissue growth and remodeling, studies focused on the early stages of tissue engineering remain limited. Here, we present a general, thermodynamically consistent model to predict tissue evolution and mechanical response throughout maturation. The formulation utilizes a stress-driven homeostatic surface to capture volumetric growth, coupled with an energy-based approach to describe collagen densification via the strain energy of the fibers. We further employ a co-rotated intermediate configuration to ensure the model's consistency and generality. The framework is demonstrated with two numerical examples: a uniaxially constrained tissue strip validated against experimental data, and a biaxially constrained specimen subjected to a perturbation load. These results highlight the potential of the proposed model to advance the design and optimization of tissue-engineered implants with clinically relevant performance."
2503.17411,"Pharmaceutical tablet formulation and process development, traditionally a complex and multi-dimensional decision-making process, necessitates extensive experimentation and resources, often resulting in suboptimal solutions. This study presents an integrated platform for tablet formulation and manufacturing, built around a Digital Formulator and a Self-Driving Tableting DataFactory. By combining predictive modelling, optimisation algorithms, and automation, this system offers a material-to-product approach to predict and optimise critical quality attributes for different formulations, linking raw material attributes to key blend and tablet properties, such as flowability, porosity, and tensile strength. The platform leverages the Digital Formulator, an in-silico optimisation framework that employs a hybrid system of models - melding data-driven and mechanistic models - to identify optimal formulation settings for manufacturability. Optimised formulations then proceed through the self-driving Tableting DataFactory, which includes automated powder dosing, tablet compression and performance testing, followed by iterative refinement of process parameters through Bayesian optimisation methods. This approach accelerates the timeline from material characterisation to development of an in-specification tablet within 6 hours, utilising less than 5 grams of API, and manufacturing small batch sizes of up to 1,440 tablets with augmented and mixed reality enabled real-time quality control within 24 hours.

The proposed method provides a modular region decomposition framework that enables efficient analysis of electromagnetic interactions between distinct structures, under the relaxed geometric condition that the constituents are separable by a plane. By leveraging the addition theorem of vector spherical wavefunctions (VSWFs), a compact matrix representation is derived to assemble the GS- and S-matrices of individual components into the overall system response. This formulation generalizes and extends prior methods developed for either multiple scattering or antenna array analysis, and is particularly suited to configurations where substructures may be repositioned or reused. Numerical examples are provided to validate the accuracy and versatility of the method, including scenarios involving tightly spaced components and rotational variations in substructure layout."
2503.17909,"Market simulator tries to create high-quality synthetic financial data that mimics real-world market dynamics, which is crucial for model development and robust assessment. Despite continuous advancements in simulation methodologies, market fluctuations vary in terms of scale and sources, but existing frameworks often excel in only specific tasks. To address this challenge, we propose Financial Wind Tunnel (FWT), a retrieval-augmented market simulator designed to generate controllable, reasonable, and adaptable market dynamics for model testing. FWT offers a more comprehensive and systematic generative capability across different data frequencies. By leveraging a retrieval method to discover cross-sectional information as the augmented condition, our diffusion-based simulator seamlessly integrates both macro- and micro-level market patterns. Furthermore, our framework allows the simulation to be controlled with wide applicability, including causal generation through ""what-if"" prompts or unprecedented cross-market trend synthesis. Additionally, we develop an automated optimizer for downstream quantitative models, using stress testing of simulated scenarios via FWT to enhance returns while controlling risks.

2503.1805,"We propose (G)I-DLE, a new approach to constrained decoding that leverages KL divergence minimization to preserve the intrinsic conditional probability distribution of autoregressive language models while excluding undesirable tokens. Unlike conventional methods that naively set banned tokens' logits to $-\infty$, which can distort the conversion from raw logits to posterior probabilities and increase output variance, (G)I-DLE re-normalizes the allowed token probabilities to minimize such distortion. We validate our method on the K2-Eval dataset, specifically designed to assess Korean language fluency, logical reasoning, and cultural appropriateness. Experimental results on Qwen2.5 models (ranging from 1.5B to 14B) demonstrate that G-IDLE not only boosts mean evaluation scores but also substantially reduces the variance of output quality."
2503.18178,"Engineers widely rely on simulation platforms like COMSOL or ANSYS to model and optimise processes. However, setting up such simulations requires expertise in defining geometry, generating meshes, establishing boundary conditions, and configuring solvers. This research aims to simplify this process by enabling engineers to describe their setup in plain language, allowing a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the necessary input files for their specific application. This novel approach allows establishing a direct link between natural language and complex engineering tasks. Building on previous work that evaluated various LLMs for generating input files across simple and complex geometries, this study demonstrates that small LLMs - specifically, Phi-3 Mini and Qwen-2.5 1.5B - can be fine-tuned to generate precise engineering geometries in GMSH format. Through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we curated a dataset of 480 instruction-output pairs encompassing simple shapes (squares, rectangles, circles, and half circles) and more complex structures (I-beams, cylindrical pipes, and bent pipes). The fine-tuned models produced high-fidelity outputs, handling routine geometry generation with minimal intervention. While challenges remain with geometries involving combinations of multiple bodies, this study demonstrates that fine-tuned small models can outperform larger models like GPT-4o in specialised tasks, offering a precise and resource-efficient alternative for engineering applications."
2503.18911,"Designing a new varifocal architecture in AR glasses poses significant challenges due to the complex interplay of multiple physics disciplines, including innovated piezo-electric material, solid mechanics, electrostatics, and optics. Traditional design methods, which treat each physics separately, are insufficient for this problem as they fail to establish the intricate relationships among design parameters in such a large and sensitive space, leading to suboptimal solutions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel design pipeline, mPhDBBs (multi-Physics Differential Building Blocks), that integrates these diverse physics through a graph neural network-based surrogate model and a differentiable ray tracing model. A hybrid optimization method combining evolutionary and gradient approaches is employed to efficiently determine superior design variables that achieve desired optical objectives, such as focal length and focusing quality. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of mPhDBBs, achieving high accuracy with minimal training data and computational resources, resulting in a speedup of at least 1000 times compared to non-gradient-based methods. This work offers a promising paradigm shift in product design, enabling rapid and accurate optimization of complex multi-physics systems, and demonstrates its adaptability to other inverse design problems."
2503.19412,"The study of sound propagation in a uniform duct having a mean flow has many applications, such as in the design of gas turbines, heating, ventilation and air conditioning ducts, automotive intake and exhaust systems, and in the modeling of speech. In this paper, the convective effects of the mean flow on the plane wave acoustic field inside a uniform duct were studied using artificial neural networks. The governing differential equation and the associated boundary conditions form a constrained optimization problem. It is converted to an unconstrained optimization problem and solved by approximating the acoustic field variable to a neural network. The complex-valued acoustic pressure and particle velocity were predicted at different frequencies, and validated against the analytical solution and the finite element models. The effect of the mean flow is studied in terms of the acoustic impedance. A closed-form expression that describes the influence of various factors on the acoustic field is derived."
2503.19712,"This study proposes a neural framework that predicts 3D vehicle collision dynamics by independently modeling global rigid-body motion and local structural deformation. Unlike approaches directly predicting absolute displacement, this method explicitly separates the vehicle's overall translation and rotation from its structural deformation. Two specialized networks form the core of the framework: a quaternion-based Rigid Net for rigid motion and a coordinate-based Deformation Net for local deformation. By independently handling fundamentally distinct physical phenomena, the proposed architecture achieves accurate predictions without requiring separate supervision for each component. The model, trained on only 10% of available simulation data, significantly outperforms baseline models, including single multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and deep operator networks (DeepONet), with prediction errors reduced by up to 83%. Extensive validation demonstrates strong generalization to collision conditions outside the training range, accurately predicting responses even under severe impacts involving extreme velocities and large impact angles. Furthermore, the framework successfully reconstructs high-resolution deformation details from low-resolution inputs without increased computational effort. Consequently, the proposed approach provides an effective, computationally efficient method for rapid and reliable assessment of vehicle safety across complex collision scenarios, substantially reducing the required simulation data and time while preserving prediction fidelity."
2503.19782,"Accurate identification of material parameters is crucial for predictive modeling in computational mechanics. The two primary approaches in the experimental mechanics' community for calibration from full-field digital image correlation data are known as finite element model updating (FEMU) and the virtual fields method (VFM). In VFM, the objective function is a squared mismatch between internal and external virtual work or power. In FEMU, the objective function quantifies the weighted mismatch between model predictions and corresponding experimentally measured quantities of interest. It is minimized by iteratively updating the parameters of an FE model. While FEMU is seen as more flexible, VFM is commonly used instead of FEMU due to its considerably greater computational expense. However, comparisons between the two methods usually involve approximations of gradients or sensitivities with finite difference schemes, thereby making direct assessments difficult. Hence, in this study, we rigorously compare VFM and FEMU in the context of numerically-exact sensitivities obtained through local sensitivity analyses and the application of automatic differentiation software. To this end, both methods are tested on a finite strain elastoplasticity model. We conduct a series of test cases to assess both methods' robustness under practical challenges."
2503.20298,"Different types of network parameters have been used in electronics since long ago. The most typical network parameters, but not the only ones, are $S$, $T$, $ABCD$, $Z$, $Y$ , and $h$ that relate input and output signals in different ways. There exist practical formulas for conversion between them. Due to the development of powerful software tools that can deal efficiently and accurately with higher-order modes in each port, researchers need conversion rules between multimode network parameters. However, the usual way to get each conversion rule is just developing cumbersome algebraic manipulations which, at the end, are useful only for some specific conversion. Here, we propose a general algebraic method to obtain any conversion rule between different multimode network parameters. It is based on the assumption of a state vector space and each conversion rule between network parameters can be interpreted as a simple change of basis. This procedure explains any conversion between multimode network parameters under the same algebraic steps."

The composite comprises a solid silica skeleton, a gaseous fluid phase, and dispersed solid fibers. The thermal transport model incorporates the effects of meso- and macro-pore size variations due to the Knudsen effect, achieved by upscaling phonon transport relations to derive constitutive equations for the fluid thermal conductivity. The mechanical model captures solid-solid and solid-fluid interactions through momentum exchange between phases. A mixed finite element formulation is employed to solve the multiphase model, and numerical studies are conducted to analyze key features of the computational model."
2503.20913,"Structure-based drug design (SBDD) is a critical task in drug discovery, requiring the generation of molecular information across two distinct modalities: discrete molecular graphs and continuous 3D coordinates. However, existing SBDD methods often overlook two key challenges: (1) the multi-modal nature of this task and (2) the causal relationship between these modalities, limiting their plausibility and performance. To address both challenges, we propose TransDiffSBDD, an integrated framework combining autoregressive transformers and diffusion models for SBDD. Specifically, the autoregressive transformer models discrete molecular information, while the diffusion model samples continuous distributions, effectively resolving the first challenge. To address the second challenge, we design a hybrid-modal sequence for protein-ligand complexes that explicitly respects the causality between modalities. Experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark demonstrate that TransDiffSBDD outperforms existing baselines."
2503.2099,"Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have received widespread attention and have significantly improved performance on audio tasks such as conversation, audio understanding, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Despite these advancements, there is an absence of a benchmark for assessing AudioLLMs in financial scenarios, where audio data, such as earnings conference calls and CEO speeches, are crucial resources for financial analysis and investment decisions. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{FinAudio}, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capacity of AudioLLMs in the financial domain. We first define three tasks based on the unique characteristics of the financial domain: 1) ASR for short financial audio, 2) ASR for long financial audio, and 3) summarization of long financial audio. Then, we curate two short and two long audio datasets, respectively, and develop a novel dataset for financial audio summarization, comprising the \textsc{FinAudio} benchmark. Then, we evaluate seven prevalent AudioLLMs on \textsc{FinAudio}. Our evaluation reveals the limitations of existing AudioLLMs in the financial domain and offers insights for improving AudioLLMs. All datasets and codes will be released."
2503.2133,"The rapid rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming traffic and transportation research, with significant advancements emerging between the years 2023 and 2025 -- a period marked by the inception and swift growth of adopting and adapting LLMs for various traffic and transportation applications. However, despite these significant advancements, a systematic review and synthesis of the existing studies remain lacking. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the methodologies and applications of LLMs in traffic and transportation, highlighting their ability to process unstructured textual data to advance transportation research. We explore key applications, including autonomous driving, travel behavior prediction, and general transportation-related queries, alongside methodologies such as zero- or few-shot learning, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning. Our analysis identifies critical research gaps. From the methodological perspective, many research gaps can be addressed by integrating LLMs with existing tools and refining LLM architectures. From the application perspective, we identify numerous opportunities for LLMs to tackle a variety of traffic and transportation challenges, building upon existing research. By synthesizing these findings, this review not only clarifies the current state of LLM adoption and adaptation in traffic and transportation but also proposes future research directions, paving the way for smarter and more sustainable transportation systems."
2503.2145,"AI-assisted protein design has emerged as a critical tool for advancing biotechnology, as deep generative models have demonstrated their reliability in this domain. However, most existing models primarily utilize protein sequence or structural data for training, neglecting the physicochemical properties ofthis http URL, they are deficient to control the generation of proteins in intuitive conditions. To address these limitations,we propose CMADiff here, a novel framework that enables controllable protein generation by aligning the physicochemical properties of protein sequences with text-based descriptions through a latent diffusion process. Specifically, CMADiff employs a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to integrate physicochemical features as conditional input, forming a robust latent space that captures biological traits. In this latent space, we apply a conditional diffusion process, which is guided by BioAligner, a contrastive learning-based module that aligns text descriptions with protein features, enabling text-driven control over protein sequence generation. Validated by a series of evaluations including AlphaFold3, the experimental results indicate that CMADiff outperforms protein sequence generation benchmarks and holds strong potential for future applications.

2503.22057,"To achieve digital intelligence transformation and carbon neutrality, effective production planning is crucial for integrated refinery-petrochemical complexes. Modern refinery planning relies on advanced optimization techniques, whose development requires reproducible benchmark problems. However, existing benchmarks lack practical context or impose oversimplified assumptions, limiting their applicability to enterprise-wide optimization. To bridge the substantial gap between theoretical research and industrial applications, this paper introduces the first open-source, demand-driven benchmark for industrial-scale refinery-petrochemical complexes with transparent model formulations and comprehensive input parameters. The benchmark incorporates a novel port-stream hybrid superstructure for modular modeling and broad generalizability. Key secondary processing units are represented using the delta-base approach grounded in historical data. Three real-world cases have been constructed to encompass distinct scenario characteristics, respectively addressing (1) a stand-alone refinery without integer variables, (2) chemical site integration with inventory-related integer variables, and (3) multi-period planning.

Additionally, this paper provides an analysis of computational performance, ablation experiments on delta-base modeling, and application scenarios for the proposed benchmark."
2503.22435,"Despite being considered a hard-to-abate sector, aviation's emissions will play an important role in long-term climate mitigation of transportation. The introduction of low-carbon energy carriers and the deployment of new aircraft in the current fleet are modeled as technology-centered decarbonization policies, while supply constraints in targeted market segments are modeled as demand-side policies. Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are used to estimate trend traffic demand and to limit the sectoral consumption of electricity and biomass. Mitigation scenarios are formulated as optimization problems, and three applications are demonstrated: no-policy baselines, single-policy optimization, and scenario-robust policies. Results show that the choice of energy carrier is highly dependent on assumptions regarding aircraft technology and the background energy system. Across all SSP-based scenarios, emissions peak by around 2040, but achieving alignment with the Paris Agreement requires either targeted demand management or additional low-carbon energy supply. The use of gradient-based optimization within a multidisciplinary framework enables the efficient resolution of these nonlinear, high-dimensional problems while reducing implementation effort."
2503.22968,"Recent advancements in Korean large language models (LLMs) have driven numerous benchmarks and evaluation methods, yet inconsistent protocols cause up to 10 p.p performance gaps across institutions. Overcoming these reproducibility gaps does not mean enforcing a one-size-fits-all evaluation. Rather, effective benchmarking requires diverse experimental approaches and a framework robust enough to support them. To this end, we introduce HRET (Haerae Evaluation Toolkit), an open-source, registry-based framework that unifies Korean LLM assessment. HRET integrates major Korean benchmarks, multiple inference backends, and multi-method evaluation, with language consistency enforcement to ensure genuine Korean outputs. Its modular registry design also enables rapid incorporation of new datasets, methods, and backends, ensuring the toolkit adapts to evolving research needs. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, HRET incorporates Korean-focused output analyses-morphology-aware Type-Token Ratio (TTR) for evaluating lexical diversity and systematic keyword-omission detection for identifying missing concepts-to provide diagnostic insights into language-specific behaviors. These targeted analyses help researchers pinpoint morphological and semantic shortcomings in model outputs, guiding focused improvements in Korean LLM development."
2503.24072,"Urbanization is the key contributor for climate change. Increasing urbanization rate causes an urban heat island (UHI) effect, which strongly depends on the short- and long-wave radiation balance heat flux between the surfaces. In order to calculate accurately this heat flux, it is required to assess the surface temperature which depends on the knowledge of the thermal properties and the surface heat transfer coefficients in the heat transfer problem. The aim of this paper is to estimate the thermal properties of the ground and the time varying surface heat transfer coefficient by solving an inverse problem. The Dufort--Frankel scheme is applied for solving the unsteady heat transfer problem. For the inverse problem, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the posterior probability density function of unknown parameters within the Bayesian framework of statistics, by applying the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for random sample generation. Actual temperature measurements available at different ground depths were used for the solution of the inverse problem. Different time discretizations were examined for the transient heat transfer coefficient at the ground surface, which then involved different prior distributions. Results of different case studies show that the estimated values of the unknown parameters were in accordance with literature values. Moreover, with the present solution of the inverse problem the temperature residuals were smaller than those obtained by using literature values for the unknowns."
2503.24117,"Most of the modeling approaches used to understand organizational worker mobility are highly stylized, using idealizations such as structureless organizations, indistinguishable workers, and a lack of social bonding of the workers. In this article, aided by a decade of precise, temporally resolved data of a large civilian organization of the US Army in which employees can change jobs in a similar way to many private organizations, we introduce a new framework to describe organizations as composites of teams within which individuals perform specific tasks and where social connections develop. By tracking the personnel composition of organizational teams, we find that workers who change jobs are highly influenced by preferring to reunite with past coworkers. In this organization, 34% of all moves across temporally stable teams (and 32% of the totality of moves) lead to worker reunions, percentages that have not been reported and are well-above intuitive expectation. To assess the importance of worker reunions in determining job moves, we compare them to labor supply and demand with or without occupational specialization. The comparison shows that the most consistent information about job change is provided by reunions. We find that the greater the time workers spend together or the smaller the team they share both increase their likelihood to reunite, supporting the notion of increased familiarity and trust behind such reunions and the dominant role of social capital in the evolution of large organizations. Our study of this organization supports the idea that to correctly forecast job mobility inside large organizations, their teams structures and the social ties formed in those teams play a key role in shaping internal job change."

The latter consists of spray-based printing of cementitious plaster on a wall and is facilitated with the use of a robotic arm. The predictions are computed using the robotic arm trajectory features, such as position, velocity and direction, as well as the printing process parameters. The proposed approach, based on a particle representation of the wall domain and the end effector, allows for the adoption of a graph-based solution. The GNN model consists of an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and is trained using data from laboratory tests, while the hyperparameters are optimized by means of a Bayesian scheme. The aim of this model is to act as a simulator of the printing process, and ultimately used for the generation of the robotic arm trajectory and the optimization of the printing parameters, towards the materialization of an autonomous plastering process. The performance of the proposed model is assessed in terms of the prediction error against unseen ground truth data, which shows its generality in varied scenarios, as well as in comparison with the performance of an existing benchmark model. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the benchmark model, with notably better performance and enhanced error scaling across prediction steps."
2504.00378,"In financial analysis, time series modeling is often hampered by data scarcity, limiting neural network models' ability to generalize. Transfer learning mitigates this by leveraging data from similar domains, but selecting appropriate source domains is crucial to avoid negative transfer. This study enhances source domain selection in transfer learning by introducing Gramian Angular Field (GAF) transformations to improve time series similarity functions. We evaluate a comprehensive range of baseline similarity functions, including both basic and state-of-the-art (SOTA) functions, and perform extensive experiments with Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The results demonstrate that GAF-based similarity functions significantly reduce prediction errors.

2504.00456,This work presents a framework to predict near-optimal anisotropic spacing functions suitable to perform simulations with unseen operating conditions or geometric configurations. The strategy consists of utilising the vast amount of high fidelity data available in industry to compute a target anisotropic spacing and train an artificial neural network to predict the spacing for unseen scenarios. The trained neural network outputs the metric tensor at the nodes of a coarse background mesh that is then used to generate meshes for unseen cases. Examples are used to demonstrate the effect of the network hyperparameters and the training dataset on the accuracy of the predictions. The potential is demonstrated for examples involving up to 11 geometric parameters on CFD simulations involving a full aircraft configuration.
2504.00538,"The fidelity of financial market simulation is restricted by the so-called ""non-identifiability"" difficulty when calibrating high-frequency data. This paper first analyzes the inherent loss of data information in this difficulty, and proposes to use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S) as the objective function for high-frequency calibration. Empirical studies verify that K-S has better identifiability of calibrating high-frequency data, while also leads to a much harder multi-modal landscape in the calibration space. To this end, we propose the adaptive stochastic ranking based negatively correlated search algorithm for improving the balance between exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on both simulated data and real market data demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain up to 36.0% improvement in high-frequency data calibration problems over the compared methods."
2504.00605,"In recent years, remanufacturing of End-of-Life (EOL) products has been adopted by manufacturing sectors as a competent practice to enhance their sustainability and market share. Due to the mass customization of products and high volatility of market, processing of new products and remanufacturing of EOLs in the same shared facility, namely Hybrid Manufacturing-Remanufacturing System (HMRS), is a mean to keep such production efficient. Accordingly, customized production capabilities are required to increase flexibility, which can be effectively provided under the Reconfigurable Manufacturing System (RMS) paradigm. Despite the advantages of utilizing RMS technologies in HMRSs, production management of such systems suffers excessive complexity. Hence, this study concentrates on the production scheduling of an HMRS consisting of non-identical parallel reconfigurable machines where the orders can be grouped into batches. In this regard, Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Constraint Programming (CP) models are devised to formulate the problem. Furthermore, a computationally efficient solution method is developed based on a Logic-based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) approach. The warm start technique is also implemented by providing a decent initial solution to the MILP model. Computational experiments attest to the LBBD method's superiority over the MILP, CP, and warm-started MILP models by obtaining an average gap of about 2%, besides it yields actionable managerial insights for scheduling in HMRSs."

Pavement surface profiles are obtained from 3D digital surface models created with Close-Range Orthogonal Photogrammetry. To characterize the roughness features of analyzed profiles, selected texture parameters were calculated from the profile's geometry. The parameters values were compared to the frictional performance obtained by numerical simulations. Contact simulations are performed according to a dedicated finite element scheme where surface roughness is directly embedded into a special class of interface finite elements. Simulations were performed for different case scenarios and the obtained results showed a notable trend between roughness descriptors and friction performance, indicating a promising potential for this numerical method to be consistently employed to predict the frictional properties of actual pavement surface profiles."
2504.01671,"Detecting butterfly hybrids requires knowledge of the parent subspecies, and the process can be tedious when encountering a new subspecies. This study focuses on a specific scenario where a model trained to recognize hybrid species A can generalize to species B when B biologically mimics A. Since species A and B share similar patterns, we leverage BioCLIP as our feature extractor to capture features based on their taxonomy. Consequently, the algorithm designed for species A can be transferred to B, as their hybrid and non-hybrid patterns exhibit similar relationships. To determine whether a butterfly is a hybrid, we adopt proposed probability filtering and color jittering to augment and simulate the mimicry. With these approaches, we achieve second place in the official development phase. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL."

For that purpose, several models have been developed at the district scale. At this scale, the outside surface energy budget is detailed, however building models are very simplified and considered as a boundary condition of the district scale model. This shortcoming inhibits the opportunity to investigate the effect of urban microclimate on the inside building conditions. The aim of this work is to improve the representation of the physical phenomena involved in the building models of a district model. For that purpose, the model integrates inside and outside fully detailed long-wave radiative flux. The numerical model is based on finite differences to solve conduction through all the surfaces and the radiosity method to solve long-wave radiative heat fluxes inside and outside. Calculated temperatures and heat fluxes are evaluated with respect to \textit{in situ} measurements from an experimental demonstrator over 14 sensors and a 24-day period. Results are also compared to state-of-the-art models simulation tool show improvement of the RMSE of $0.9 \ \mathsf{^{\,\circ}C}$ to $2.1 \ \mathsf{^{\,\circ}C}$ on the surface temperature modeled."
2504.01868,"Ensuring the seismic safety of nuclear power plants (NPPs) is essential, especially for facilities that rely on base isolation to reduce earthquake impacts. For understanding the seismic response, accurate models are key to predict the ground motions, which are generally sensitive to various factors, including earthquake source parameters like the focal mechanism, i.e., strike, dip, and rake angles. This study examines how uncertainties in these parameters affect ground motion predictions. The analysis is based on the SMATCH benchmark, which provides a standardized approach for evaluating the seismic response of the Cruas-Meysse NPP in France during the Mw 4.9 Le-Teil earthquake of 2019. A set of 27 3D high-fidelity numerical simulations was performed using a spectral-element method, each incorporating different focal mechanism variations. These simulations provide an effective approach for investigating the factors behind the exceptional ground motion observed during this event. To quantify uncertainty, the simulated ground motions were compared to recorded data using two well-established goodness-of-fit criteria: one assessing time-frequency domain characteristics and another focusing on the characterization of the ground motion signals by intensity measures. Results highlight the significant influence of focal mechanism variability on ground motion predictions, especially on the rake angle, which showed the strongest correlation with wave and intensity measures."
2504.02165,"Financial institutions of all sizes are increasingly adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance credit assessments, deliver personalized client advisory services, and automate various language-intensive processes. However, effectively deploying LLMs requires careful management of stringent data governance requirements, heightened demands for interpretability, ethical responsibilities, and rapidly evolving regulatory landscapes. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured six-decision framework specifically designed for the financial sector, guiding organizations systematically from initial feasibility assessments to final deployment strategies.The framework encourages institutions to: (1) evaluate whether an advanced LLM is necessary at all, (2) formalize robust data governance and privacy safeguards, (3) establish targeted risk management mechanisms, (4) integrate ethical considerations early in the development process, (5) justify the initiative's return on investment (ROI) and strategic value, and only then (6) choose the optimal implementation pathway -- open-source versus proprietary, or in-house versus vendor-supported -- aligned with regulatory requirements and operational realities. By linking strategic considerations with practical steps such as pilot testing, maintaining comprehensive audit trails, and conducting ongoing compliance evaluations, this decision framework offers a structured roadmap for responsibly leveraging LLMs. Rather than acting as a rigid, one-size-fits-all solution, it shows how advanced language models can be thoughtfully integrated into existing workflows -- balancing innovation with accountability to uphold stakeholder trust and regulatory integrity."
2504.02177,"Model rocketry presents a design task accessible to undergraduates while remaining an interesting challenge. Allowing for variation in fins, nose cones, and body tubes presents a rich design space containing numerous ways to achieve various altitudes. Therefore, when exploring possible designs computationally, it makes sense to apply a method that produces various possibilities for decision-makers to choose from: Quality Diversity (QD). The QD methods MAP-Elites, CMA-ME, and CMA-MAE are applied to model rocket design using the open-source OpenRocket software to characterize the behavior and determine the fitness of evolved designs. Selected rockets were manufactured and launched to evaluate them in the real world. Simulation results demonstrate that CMA-ME produces the widest variety of rocket designs, which is surprising given that CMA-MAE is a more recent method designed to overcome shortcomings with CMA-ME. Real-world testing demonstrates that a wide range of standard and unconventional designs are viable, though issues with the jump from simulation to reality cause some rockets to perform unexpectedly. This paper provides a case study on applying QD to a task accessible to a broader audience than industrial engineering tasks and uncovers unexpected results about the relative performance of different QD algorithms."
2504.02191,"We introduce MHNpath, a machine learning-driven retrosynthetic tool designed for computer-aided synthesis planning. Leveraging modern Hopfield networks and novel comparative metrics, MHNpath efficiently prioritizes reaction templates, improving the scalability and accuracy of retrosynthetic predictions. The tool incorporates a tunable scoring system that allows users to prioritize pathways based on cost, reaction temperature, and toxicity, thereby facilitating the design of greener and cost-effective reaction routes.

2504.02249,"This paper demonstrates that deep learning models trained on raw OHLCV (open-high-low-close-volume) data can achieve comparable performance to traditional machine learning (ML) models using technical indicators for stock price prediction in Korean markets. While previous studies have emphasized the importance of technical indicators and feature engineering, we show that a simple LSTM network trained on raw OHLCV data alone can match the performance of sophisticated ML models that incorporate technical indicators. Using a dataset of Korean stocks from 2006 to 2024, we optimize the triple barrier labeling parameters to achieve balanced label proportions with a 29-day window and 9\% barriers. Our experiments reveal that LSTM networks achieve similar performance to traditional machine learning models like XGBoost, despite using only raw OHLCV data without any technical indicators. Furthermore, we identify that the optimal window size varies with model hidden size, with a configuration of window size 100 and hidden size 8 yielding the best performance. Additionally, our results confirm that using full OHLCV data provides better predictive accuracy compared to using only close price or close price with volume. These findings challenge conventional approaches to feature engineering in financial forecasting and suggest that simpler approaches focusing on raw data and appropriate model selection may be more effective than complex feature engineering strategies."
2504.02281,"Financial reinforcement learning (FinRL) is now a practical paradigm for financial engineering. However, applying RL strategies to real-world trading tasks remains a challenge for individuals, as it is error-prone and engineering-heavy. The non-stationarity of financial data, low signal-to-noise ratios, and various market frictions require deep accumulations. Although numerous FinRL methods have been developed for tasks such as stock/crypto trading and portfolio management, the lack of standardized task definitions, real-time high-quality datasets, close-to-real market environments, and robust baselines has hindered consistent reproduction in both open-source community and FinTech industry. To bridge this gap, we organized a series of FinRL Contests from 2023 to 2025, covering a diverse range of financial tasks such as stock trading, order execution, crypto trading, and the use of large language model (LLM)-engineered signals. These contests attracted 200+ participants from 100+ institutions over 20+ countries. To encourage participations, we provided starter kits featuring GPU-optimized parallel market environments, ensemble learning, and comprehensive instructions. In this paper, we summarize these benchmarking efforts, detailing task formulations, data curation pipelines, environment implementations, evaluation protocols, participant performance, and organizational insights. It guides our follow-up FinRL contests, and also provides a reference for FinAI contests alike."
2504.02307,"This study presents an advanced numerical framework that integrates experimentally acquired Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) data into high-fidelity simulations for adhesive rough contact problems, bridging the gap between experimental physics and computational mechanics. The proposed approach extends the eMbedded Profile for Joint Roughness (MPJR) interface finite element method to incorporate both surface topography and spatially varying adhesion properties, imported directly from AFM measurements. The adhesion behavior is modeled using a modified Lennard-Jones potential, which is locally parameterized based on the AFM-extracted adhesion peak force and energy dissipation data. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through 2D and 3D finite element simulations of a heterogeneous PS-LDPE (polystyrene matrix with low-density polyethylene inclusions) sample, where the bulk elastic properties are also experimentally characterized via AFM. The results highlight the significance of accounting for both surface adhesion variability and material bulk heterogeneity in accurately predicting contact responses."
2504.02429,"Existing financial sentiment analysis methods often fail to capture the multi-faceted nature of risk in bond markets due to their single-level approach and neglect of temporal dynamics. We propose Multi-Level Sentiment Analysis based on pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs), a novel framework that systematically integrates firm-specific micro-level sentiment, industry-specific meso-level sentiment, and duration-aware smoothing to model the latency and persistence of textual impact. Applying our framework to the comprehensive Chinese bond market corpus constructed by us (2013-2023, 1.39M texts), we extracted a daily composite sentiment index. Empirical results show statistically measurable improvements in credit spread forecasting when incorporating sentiment (3.25% MAE and 10.96% MAPE reduction), with sentiment shifts closely correlating with major social risk events and firm-specific crises. This framework provides a more nuanced understanding of sentiment across different market levels while accounting for the temporal evolution of sentiment effects."

2504.03372,"With advancements in additive manufacturing (AM) capabilities, new opportunities arise to design compact heat exchangers (cHEXs) that leverage AM's degrees of freedom (DOFs) to enhance energy and material efficiency. However, excessive size reduction in counterflow cHEXs can compromise effectiveness due to axial heat conduction through the solid material, influenced by thermal conductivity and wall thickness. This study investigates how AM material selection and thin-wall production limitations might constrain the core size of counterflow plate heat exchangers when targeting maximum power density. An optimization framework evaluates power densities for six materials: plastic, austenitic steel, Al2O3, AlN, aluminum, and copper. Evaluations are conducted under constant effectiveness and pressure drop while accounting for AM-specific plate thickness limits and a lower bound on plate spacing to address fouling. Across all scenarios, copper cHEXs exhibit the lowest power density, despite high thermal conductivity. Without constraints on plate thickness and spacing, the optimal plastic cHEX achieves a power density 1800x greater than the steel baseline, while copper decreases by a factor of 0.98. With equal plate thickness of 0.5 mm for all materials, plastic retains the highest power density, 12.2x more than copper. Introducing a fouling constraint of 0.8 mm plate spacing shifts the optimal material to austenitic steel. When material-specific plate thicknesses are considered, the plastic cHEX achieves the highest power density, five times greater than copper, due to superior thin-wall resolution. This study highlights the impact of AM constraints on the energy and material efficiency of cHEXs, and shows that low-conductivity materials like plastic or austenitic steel can outperform high-conductivity materials like copper in compact designs."
2504.03436,"Periodic fin structures are often employed to enhance heat transfer in compact cooling solutions and heat exchangers. Adjoint-based optimization methods are able to further increase the heat transfer by optimizing the fin geometry. However, obtaining optimal geometries remains challenging in general because of the high computational cost of full array simulations. In this paper, a unit cell optimization approach is presented that starts from recently developed macro-scale models for isothermal solid structures. The models exploit the periodicity of the problem to reduce the computational cost of evaluating the array heat transfer to that of a single periodic unit cell. By combining these models with a geometrically-constrained free-shape optimization approach, optimal fin geometries are obtained for the periodic fin array that maintain a minimal fin distance. Moreover, using an augmented Lagrangian approach, also the average pressure gradient and barycenter of the fin can be fixed. On a fictitious use-case, heat transfer increases up to 104 \% are obtained. When also flow rate is constrained in addition to maintain a high effectiveness, only up to 8 \% heat transfer increase is observed. Finally, the errors of the unit-cell optimization approach are investigated, indicating that with a good choice of cost functional formulation, errors of the approach as low as 1-2 \% can be obtained for the periodically developed part of the array. Finally, the entrance effect to the heat transfer is found to be non-negligible with a contribution of 10-15 \% for the considered fin array. This advocates for further research to extend the unit-cell models towards improved modeling of entrance effects."
2504.04103,"Accurately predicting traffic accidents in real-time is a critical challenge in autonomous driving, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Existing solutions often suffer from high computational overhead or fail to adequately address the uncertainty of evolving traffic scenarios. This paper introduces LATTE, a Lightweight Attention-based Traffic Accident Anticipation Engine, which integrates computational efficiency with state-of-the-art performance. LATTE employs Efficient Multiscale Spatial Aggregation (EMSA) to capture spatial features across scales, Memory Attention Aggregation (MAA) to enhance temporal modeling, and Auxiliary Self-Attention Aggregation (AAA) to extract latent dependencies over extended sequences. Additionally, LATTE incorporates the Flamingo Alert-Assisted System (FAA), leveraging a vision-language model to provide real-time, cognitively accessible verbal hazard alerts, improving passenger situational awareness. Evaluations on benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate LATTE's superior predictive capabilities and computational efficiency. LATTE achieves state-of-the-art 89.74% Average Precision (AP) on DAD benchmark, with 5.4% higher mean Time-To-Accident (mTTA) than the second-best model, and maintains competitive mTTA at a Recall of 80% (TTA@R80) (4.04s) while demonstrating robust accident anticipation across diverse driving conditions. Its lightweight design delivers a 93.14% reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs) and a 31.58% decrease in parameter count (Params), enabling real-time operation on resource-limited hardware without compromising performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of LATTE's architectural components, while visualizations and failure case analyses highlight its practical applicability and areas for enhancement."
2504.04169,"This study aims to present a new hybrid method for weighting criteria. The methodological project combines the ENTROPY and CRITIC methods with the TOPSIS method to create EC-TOPSIS. The difference lies in the use of a weight range per criterion. Each weight range has a lower limit and an upper limit, which are combined to generate random numbers, producing t sets of weights per criterion, allowing t final rankings to be obtained. The final ranking is obtained by applying the MODE statistical measure to the set of t positions of each alternative. The method was validated by ranking the companies based on social media metrics consisting of user-generated content (UGC). The result was compared with the original modeling using the CRITIC-ARAS and CRITIC-COPRAS methods, and the results were consistent and balanced, with few changes. The practical implication of the method is in reducing the uncertainties surrounding the final classification due to the random weighting process and the number of interactions sent."
2504.04375,"Machine learning methods, such as diffusion models, are widely explored as a promising way to accelerate high-fidelity fluid dynamics computation via a super-resolution process from faster-to-compute low-fidelity input. However, existing approaches usually make impractical assumptions that the low-fidelity data is down-sampled from high-fidelity data. In reality, low-fidelity data is produced by numerical solvers that use a coarser resolution. Solver-generated low-fidelity data usually sacrifices fine-grained details, such as small-scale vortices compared to high-fidelity ones. Our findings show that SOTA diffusion models struggle to reconstruct fine-scale details when faced with solver-generated low-fidelity inputs. To bridge this gap, we propose SG-Diff, a novel diffusion model for reconstruction, where both low-fidelity inputs and high-fidelity targets are generated from numerical solvers. We propose an \textit{Importance Weight} strategy during training that serves as a form of self-guidance, focusing on intricate fluid details, and a \textit{Predictor-Corrector-Advancer} SDE solver that embeds physical guidance into the diffusion sampling process. Together, these techniques steer the diffusion model toward more accurate reconstructions. Experimental results on four 2D turbulent flow datasets demonstrate the efficacy of \model~against state-of-the-art baselines."
2504.04447,"We develop robust and scalable fully implicit nonlinear finite element solvers for the simulations of biological transportation networks driven by the gradient flow minimization of a non-convex energy cost functional. Our approach employs a discontinuous space for the conductivity tensor that allows us to guarantee the preservation of its positive semi-definiteness throughout the entire minimization procedure arising from the time integration of the gradient flow dynamics using a backward Euler scheme. Extensive tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate the robustness and performance of the solver, highlight the sensitivity of the emergent network structures to mesh resolution and topology, and validate the resilience of the linear preconditioner to the ill-conditioning of the model. The implementation achieves near-optimal parallel scaling on large-scale, high-performance computing platforms. To the best of our knowledge, the network formation system has never been simulated in three dimensions before. Consequently, our three-dimensional results are the first of their kind."

We present a conceptual modeling approach implemented into the open-source simulator Dumux and, after verification examples, at hand of a CO2-storage scenario, we discuss impacts of biomineralization on the stress distribution in the rock and potentially altered risks of fault reactivations and induced seismic events.The generic study shows the tendency towards increased stiffness due to precipitated carbonate, which may cause shear failure events to occur earlier than in an untreated setup, while the magnitude of the seismicity is smaller."
2504.05852,"Generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in domains such as text, image, and video synthesis. In this work, we explore the application of generative models to fluid dynamics, specifically for turbulence simulation, where classical numerical solvers are computationally expensive. We propose a novel stochastic generative model based on stochastic interpolants, which enables probabilistic forecasting while incorporating physical constraints such as energy stability and divergence-freeness. Unlike conventional stochastic generative models, which are often agnostic to underlying physical laws, our approach embeds energy consistency by making the parameters of the stochastic interpolant learnable coefficients. We evaluate our method on a benchmark turbulence problem - Kolmogorov flow - demonstrating superior accuracy and stability over state-of-the-art alternatives such as autoregressive conditional diffusion models (ACDMs) and PDE-Refiner. Furthermore, we achieve stable results for significantly longer roll-outs than standard stochastic interpolants. Our results highlight the potential of physics-aware generative models in accelerating and enhancing turbulence simulations while preserving fundamental conservation properties."

2504.06093,"Local-nonlocal coupling approaches provide a means to combine the computational efficiency of local models and the accuracy of nonlocal models. To facilitate the coupling of the two models, non-matching grids are often desirable as nonlocal grids usually require a finer resolution than local grids. In that case, it is often convenient to resort to interpolation operators so that models can exchange information in the overlap regions when nodes from the two grids do not coincide. This paper studies three existing coupling approaches, namely 1) a method that enforces matching displacements in an overlap region, 2) a variant that enforces a constraint on the stresses instead, and 3) a method that considers a variable horizon in the vicinity of the interfaces. The effect of the interpolation order and of the grid ratio on the performance of the three coupling methods with non-matching grids is carefully studied on one-dimensional examples using polynomial manufactured solutions. The numerical results show that the degree of the interpolants should be chosen with care to avoid introducing additional modeling errors, or simply minimize these errors, in the coupling approach."
2504.0686,"Multiple model reduction techniques have been proposed to tackle linear and non linear problems. Intrusive model order reduction techniques exhibit high accuracy levels, however, they are rarely used as a standalone industrial tool, because of the required high level knowledge involved in the construction and usage of these techniques. Moreover, the computation time benefit is compromised for highly nonlinear problems. On the other hand, non-intrusive methods often struggle with accuracy in nonlinear cases, typically requiring a large design of experiment and a large number of snapshots achieve a reliable performance. However, generating the stiffness matrix in a non-intrusive approach presents an optimal way to align accuracy with efficiency, allying the advantages of both intrusive and non-intrusivethis http URLwork introduces a lightly intrusive model order reduction technique that employs machine learning within a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition framework to achieve this alliance.

This wind farm (under construction) is considered to be the first commercial, utility-scale (50MW) wind farm in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) area. The proposed wind turbine has an expected electricity generation of 2MW. We studied the wind atlas of Oman and from which we determined the maximum possible mean wind speed in the entire Sultanate and built our design based on that reference value, which is 6m/s (21.6km/h). After this, we applied a set of modeling equations that estimate the power output from the wind turbine rotor and matched the target electric power to the design variables using a MATLAB computer code.

This study aims to predict soil slope displacements of earth embankments subjected to earthquake loading using evolutionary algorithms. Comprehensive real case histories of slope displacement of earth embankments under past earthquakes in different areas of the world were gathered and analyzed. A robust model was then developed to predict earthquake induced soil slope displacements using gene expression programming (GEP). Characteristics of earthquake ground motion including earthquake magnitude, earthquake predominant period, maximum earthquake acceleration and also geotechnical specifications of earth embankment including yield acceleration and fundamental period of earth embankment were taken as most influential factors on the slope displacements of earth embankments under earthquakes. Subsequently, performance of developed GEP-based predictive model was assessed using a sensitivity analysis under various effective factors. Finally, the accuracy of the predictive model was evaluated through comparison with the available relationships for estimation of seismic soil slope displacements. The results clearly indicate favorable accuracy of developed GEP-based model to predict slope displacements of earth embankments subjected to earthquake ground motions."

2504.09804,"Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is becoming a popular alternative method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they require dedicated manual modifications to the hyperparameters of the network, the sampling methods and loss function weights for different PDEs, which reduces the efficiency of the solvers. In this paper, we pro- pose a general multi-stage framework, i.e. BO-SA-PINNs to alleviate this issue. In the first stage, Bayesian optimization (BO) is used to select hyperparameters for the training process, and based on the results of the pre-training, the network architecture, learning rate, sampling points distribution and loss function weights suitable for the PDEs are automatically determined. The proposed hyperparameters search space based on experimental results can enhance the efficiency of BO in identifying optimal hyperparameters. After selecting the appropriate hyperparameters, we incorporate a global self-adaptive (SA) mechanism the second stage. Using the pre-trained model and loss information in the second-stage training, the exponential moving average (EMA) method is employed to optimize the loss function weights, and residual-based adaptive refinement with distribution (RAR-D) is used to optimize the sampling points distribution. In the third stage, L-BFGS is used for stable training. In addition, we introduce a new activation function that enables BO-SA-PINNs to achieve higher accuracy. In numerical experiments, we conduct comparative and ablation experiments to verify the performance of the model on Helmholtz, Maxwell, Burgers and high-dimensional Poisson equations. The comparative experiment results show that our model can achieve higher accuracy and fewer iterations in test cases, and the ablation experiments demonstrate the positive impact of every improvement."
2504.10078,"While stock prediction task traditionally relies on volume-price and fundamental data to predict the return ratio or price movement trend, sentiment factors derived from social media platforms such as StockTwits offer a complementary and useful source of real-time market information. However, we find that most social media posts, along with the public sentiment they reflect, provide limited value for trading predictions due to their noisy nature. To tackle this, we propose a novel dynamic expert tracing algorithm that filters out non-informative posts and identifies both true and inverse experts whose consistent predictions can serve as valuable trading signals. Our approach achieves significant improvements over existing expert identification methods in stock trend prediction. However, when using binary expert predictions to predict the return ratio, similar to all other expert identification methods, our approach faces a common challenge of signal sparsity with expert signals cover only about 4% of all stock-day combinations in our dataset. To address this challenge, we propose a dual graph attention neural network that effectively propagates expert signals across related stocks, enabling accurate prediction of return ratios and significantly increasing signal coverage. Empirical results show that our propagated expert-based signals not only exhibit strong predictive power independently but also work synergistically with traditional financial features. These combined signals significantly outperform representative baseline models in all quant-related metrics including predictive accuracy, return metrics, and correlation metrics, resulting in more robust investment strategies. We hope this work inspires further research into leveraging social media data for enhancing quantitative investment strategies. The code can be seen inthis https URL."
2504.10609,"Analyzing synthesis pathways for target molecules in a chemical reaction network annotated with information on the kinetics of individual reactions is an area of active study. This work presents a computational methodology for searching for pathways in reaction networks which is based on integer linear programming and the modeling of reaction networks by directed hypergraphs. Often multiple pathways fit the given search criteria. To rank them, we develop an objective function based on physical arguments maximizing the probability of the pathway. We furthermore develop an automated pipeline to estimate the energy barriers of individual reactions in reaction networks. Combined, the methodology facilitates flexible and kinetically informed pathway investigations on large reaction networks by computational means, even for networks coming without kinetic annotation, such as those created via generative approaches for expanding molecular spaces."
2504.10901,"This project focuses on designing and verifying a synchronous FIFO First In First Out (FIFO) memory, a critical component in digital systems for temporary data storage and seamless data transfer. The FIFO operates under a single clock domain, ensuring synchronized read and write operations, making it suitable for systems requiring high-speed, reliable data buffering. This design includes FIFO's key features, such as read and write operations, full and empty flag generation, and pointer management for memory control. The FIFO was implemented using Verilog to define the Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, ensuring functionality and timing requirements were met. For verification, three approaches were employed: (1) UVM-based Verification: A Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) testbench was developed to test the FIFO design rigorously. The testbench includes components like interface, sequence item, driver, monitor, scoreboard, agent, and environment. Directed and random tests were performed to verify corner cases, such as simultaneous reads and writes, full and empty conditions, and overflow and underflow scenarios; (2) Traditional Verilog Testbench: A standalone Verilog testbench was also used to validate the functionality of the FIFO through directed test scenarios and waveform analysis; (3) FPGA implementation: Additionally, the design was implemented on an FPGA for real-time testing to verify its functionality and timing behavior in hardware. FPGA-based verification ensured the design performed as expected under practical conditions. The results confirmed the correct operation of the FIFO, including accurate data transfer, flag behavior, and timing synchronization. The project successfully demonstrated the robustness and reliability of the synchronous FIFO design, highlighting its importance in modern digital systems for efficient data handling and buffering."
2504.11191,"We extend the foil winding homogenization method to magnetic field conforming formulations. We first propose a full magnetic field foil winding formulation by analogy with magnetic flux density conforming formulations. We then introduce the magnetic scalar potential in non-conducting regions to improve the efficiency of the model. This leads to a significant reduction in the number of degrees of freedom, particularly in 3-D applications. The proposed models are verified on two frequency-domain benchmark problems: a 2-D axisymmetric problem and a 3-D problem. They reproduce results obtained with magnetic flux density conforming formulations and with resolved conductor models that explicitly discretize all turns. Moreover, the models are applied in the transient simulation of a high-temperature superconducting coil. In all investigated configurations, the proposed models provide reliable results while considerably reducing the size of the numerical problem to be solved."
2504.12069,"A three-dimensional mesoscopic viscoplasticity model for simulating rate-dependent plasticity and creep in unidirectional thermoplastic composites is presented. The constitutive model is a transversely isotropic extension of an isotropic finite strain viscoplasticity model for neat polymers. Rate-dependent plasticity and creep are described by a non-Newtonian flow rule where the viscosity of the material depends on an equivalent stress measure through an Eyring-type relation. In the present formulation, transverse isotropy is incorporated by defining the equivalent stress measure and flow rule as functions of transversely isotropic stress invariants. In addition, the Eyring-type viscosity function is extended with anisotropic pressure dependence. As a result of the formulation, plastic flow in fiber direction is effectively excluded and pressure dependence of the polymer matrix is accounted for. The re-orientation of the transversely isotropic plane during plastic deformations is incorporated in the constitutive equations, allowing for an accurate large deformation response. The formulation is fully implicit and a consistent linearization of the algorithmic constitutive equations is performed to derive the consistent tangent modulus. The performance of the mesoscopic constitutive model is assessed through a comparison with a micromechanical model for carbon/PEEK, with the original isotropic viscoplastic version for the polymer matrix and with hyperelastic fibers. The micromodel is first used to determine the material parameters of the mesoscale model with a few stress-strain curves. It is demonstrated that the mesoscale model gives a similar response to the micromodel under various loading conditions. Finally, the mesoscale model is validated against off-axis experiments on unidirectional thermoplastic composite plies."
2504.12159,"Deep Material Network (DMN) has emerged as a powerful framework for multiscale material modeling, enabling efficient and accurate predictions of material behavior across different length scales. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, the trainable parameters in DMN have direct physical interpretations, capturing the geometric characteristics of the microstructure rather than serving as purely statistical fitting parameters. Its hierarchical tree structure effectively encodes microstructural interactions and deformation mechanisms, allowing DMN to achieve a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This physics-informed architecture significantly reduces computational costs compared to direct numerical simulations while preserving essential microstructural physics. Furthermore, DMN can be trained solely on a linear elastic dataset while effectively extrapolating nonlinear responses during online prediction, making it a highly efficient and scalable approach for multiscale material modeling. This article provides a comprehensive review of DMN, detailing its motivation, underlying methodology, and recent advancements. We discuss key modeling aspects, including its hierarchical structure, training process, and the role of physics-based constraints in enhancing predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we highlight its applications in component-scale multiscale analysis and inverse parameter identification, demonstrating its capability to bridge microscale material behavior with macroscale engineering predictions. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions in improving DMN's generalization capabilities and its potential extensions for broader applications in multiscale modeling."
2504.12613,"A rigorous and computationally efficient method is presented for evaluating the reflection coefficients of antennas operating above planar layered media. The approach reformulates the problem within the framework of the antenna's generalized scattering matrix (GSM), expressed in terms of spherical vector wave functions (SVWFs). The mutual interaction between the antenna and the layered structure is modeled through spherical-to-planar vector wave transformations that incorporate the exact Fresnel reflection response of the medium, without introducing any simplifying approximations. This formulation dramatically reduces algebraic complexity and enables fast, stable numerical implementation. Excluding the one-time preprocessing required to obtain the antenna's free-space GSM, each evaluation for a given layered configuration can be completed within milliseconds -- achieving several orders of magnitude speed improvement over full-wave solvers such as FEKO, while maintaining virtually identical accuracy. The proposed framework thus provides a powerful foundation for real-time electromagnetic characterization and inverse modeling involving planar layered environments."
2504.13274,"Cardiac action potential models allow examination of a variety of cardiac dynamics, including how behavior may change under specific interventions. To study a specific scenario, including patient-specific cases, model parameter sets must be found that accurately reproduce the dynamics of interest. To facilitate this complex and time-consuming process, we present an interactive browser-based tool that uses the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm implemented in JavaScript and taking advantage of the WebGL API for hardware acceleration. Our tool allows rapid customization and can find low-error fittings to user-provided voltage time series or action potential duration data from multiple cycle lengths in a few iterations (10-32), corresponding to a runtime of a few seconds on most machines. Additionally, our tool focuses on ease of use and flexibility, providing a webpage interface that allows users to select a subset of parameters to fit, set the range of values each parameter is allowed to assume, and control the PSO algorithm hyperparameters. We demonstrate our tool's utility by fitting a variety of models to different datasets, showing how convergence is affected by model choice, dataset properties, and PSO algorithmic settings, and explaining new insights gained about the physiological and dynamical roles of the model parameters."
2504.14897,"Data compression is a critical technology for large-scale plasma simulations. Storing complete particle information requires Terabyte-scale data storage, and analysis requires ad-hoc scalable post-processing tools. We propose a physics-aware in-situ compression method using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to approximate electron and ion velocity distribution functions with a number of Gaussian components. This GMM-based method allows us to capture plasma features such as mean velocity and temperature, and it enables us to identify heating processes and generate beams. We first construct a histogram to reduce computational overhead and apply GPU-accelerated, in-situ GMM fitting within iPIC3D, a large-scale implicit Particle-in-Cell simulator, ensuring real-time compression. The compressed representation is stored using the ADIOS 2 library, thus optimizing the I/O process. The GPU and histogramming implementation provides a significant speed-up with respect to GMM on particles (both in time and required memory at run-time), enabling real-time compression. Compared to algorithms like SZ, MGARD, and BLOSC2, our GMM-based method has a physics-based approach, retaining the physical interpretation of plasma phenomena such as beam formation, acceleration, and heating mechanisms. Our GMM algorithm achieves a compression ratio of up to $10^4$, requiring a processing time comparable to, or even lower than, standard compression engines."
2504.15492,"In this contribution, we present a novel consistent dual-stage approach for the automated generation of hyperelastic constitutive models which only requires experimentally measurable data. To generate input data for our approach, an experiment with full-field measurement has to be conducted to gather testing force and corresponding displacement field of the sample. Then, in the first step of the dual-stage framework, a new finite strain Data-Driven Identification (DDI) formulation is applied. This method enables to identify tuples consisting of stresses and strains by only prescribing the applied boundary conditions and the measured displacement field. In the second step, the data set is used to calibrate a Physics-Augmented Neural Network (PANN), which fulfills all common conditions of hyperelasticity by construction and is very flexible at the same time. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by several descriptive examples. Two-dimensional synthetic data are exemplarily generated in virtual experiments by using a reference constitutive model. The calibrated PANN is then applied in 3D Finite Element simulations. In addition, a real experiment including noisy data is mimicked."
2504.15814,"Wave equations help us to understand phenomena ranging from earthquakes to tsunamis. These phenomena materialise over very large scales. It would be computationally infeasible to track them over a regular mesh. Yet, since the phenomena are localised, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) can be used to construct meshes with a higher resolution close to the regions of interest. ExaHyPE is a software engine created to solve wave problems using AMR, and we use it as baseline to construct our numerical relativity application called ExaGRyPE. To advance the mesh in time, we have to interpolate and restrict along resolution transitions in each and every time step. ExaHyPE's vanilla code version uses a d-linear tensor-product approach. In benchmarks of a stationary black hole this performs slowly and leads to errors in conserved quantities near AMR boundaries. We therefore introduce a set of higher-order interpolation schemes where the derivatives are calculated at each coarse grid cell to approximate the enclosed fine cells. The resulting methods run faster than the tensor-product approach. Most importantly, when running the stationary black hole simulation using the higher order methods the errors near the AMR boundaries are removed."
2504.16261,"Protein-ligand binding complexes are ubiquitous and essential to life. Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (PLA) quantifies the binding strength between ligands and proteins, providing crucial insights for discovering and designing potential candidate ligands. While recent advances have been made in predicting protein-ligand complex structures, existing algorithms for interaction and affinity prediction suffer from a sharp decline in performance when handling ligands bound with novel unseen proteins. We propose IPBind, a geometric deep learning-based computational method, enabling robust predictions by leveraging interatomic potential between complex's bound and unbound status. Experimental results on widely used binding affinity prediction benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of IPBind. Meanwhile, it provides atom-level insights into prediction. This work highlights the advantage of leveraging machine learning interatomic potential for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity."
2504.16361,"This paper compares different Transformer model architectures for stock index prediction. While many studies have shown that Transformers perform well in stock price forecasting, few have explored how different structural designs impact performance. Most existing works treat the Transformer as a black box, overlooking how specific architectural choices may affect predictive accuracy. However, understanding these differences is critical for developing more effective forecasting models. This study aims to identify which Transformer variant is most suitable for stock forecasting. This study evaluates five Transformer structures: (1) encoder-only Transformer, (2) decoder-only Transformer, (3) Vanilla Transformer (encoder + decoder), (4) Vanilla Transformer without embedding layers, and (5) Vanilla Transformer with ProbSparse attention. Results show that Transformer-based models generally outperform traditional approaches. Transformer with decoder only structure outperforms all other models in all scenarios. Transformer with ProbSparse attention has the worst performance in almost all cases."
2504.16518,"The optimization of parametric quantum circuits is technically hindered by three major obstacles: the non-convex nature of the objective function, noisy gradient evaluations, and the presence of barren plateaus. As a result, the selection of classical optimizer becomes a critical factor in assessing and exploiting quantum-classical applications. One promising approach to tackle these challenges involves incorporating curvature information into the parameter update. The most prominent methods in this field are quasi-Newton and quantum natural gradient methods, which can facilitate faster convergence compared to first-order approaches. Second order methods however exhibit a significant trade-off between computational cost and accuracy, as well as heightened sensitivity to noise. This study evaluates the performance of three families of optimizers on synthetically generated MaxCut problems on a shallow QAOA algorithm. To address noise sensitivity and iteration cost, we demonstrate that incorporating secant-penalization in the BFGS update rule (SP-BFGS) yields improved outcomes for QAOA optimization problems, introducing a novel approach to stabilizing BFGS updates against gradient noise."
2504.166,"Safety assessment of patients with one-dimensionally structured passive implants, like cranial meshes or stents, exposed to low or medium frequency magnetic fields, like those generated in magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic hyperthermia, can be challenging, because of the different length scales of the implant and the human body. Most of the methods used to estimate the heating induced near such implants neglect the presence of the metallic materials within the body, modeling the metal as thermal seeds. To overcome this limitation, a novel numerical approach that solves three-dimensional and one-dimensional coupled problems is proposed. The proposed method is compared with measurements performed on a cranial mesh exposed to the magnetic field generated by a gradient coil system for magnetic resonance imaging. Then, it is applied to a magnetic hyperthermia case study in which a patient with a cranial mesh is exposed to the magnetic field generated by a collar-type magnetic hyperthermia applicator for neck tumour treatment. The experimental comparison of the proposed method predictions and the measurement data shows an improved accuracy near the maximum temperature increase up to 25% with respect to the method based on thermal seeds. The application of the proposed method applied to the magnetic hyperthermia case study leads to a prediction of the maximum temperature increase that is 10% lower than the one overestimated by relying on thermal seeds. At the same time, the proposed method corrects the underestimation of the thermal seeds in the regions where the electromagnetic power is not directly deposited and the temperature increase is only due to heat transfer. The proposed method leads to improved results with respect to previous approximations by modelling the thermal diffusion through the highly conductive metallic implants."
2504.1711,"Consistency and stability are two essential ingredients in the design of numerical algorithms for partial differential equations. Robust algorithms can be developed by incorporating nonlinear physical stability principles in their design, such as the entropy production inequality (i.e., the Clausius-Duhem inequality or second law of thermodynamics), rather than by simply adding artificial viscosity (a common approach). This idea is applied to the k-epsilon and two-equation turbulence models by introducing space-time averaging. Then, a set of entropy variables can be defined which leads to a symmetric system of advective-diffusive equations. Positivity and symmetry of the equations require certain constraints on the turbulence diffusivity coefficients and the turbulence source terms. With these, we are able to design entropy producing two-equation turbulence models and, in particular, the k-epsilon model."
2504.17313,"Effective stock price forecasting (estimating future prices) and prediction (estimating future price changes) are pivotal for investors, regulatory agencies, and policymakers. These tasks enable informed decision-making, risk management, strategic planning, and superior portfolio returns. Despite their importance, forecasting and prediction are challenging due to the dynamic nature of stock price data, which exhibit significant temporal variations in distribution and statistical properties. Additionally, while both forecasting and prediction targets are derived from the same dataset, their statistical characteristics differ significantly. Forecasting targets typically follow a log-normal distribution, characterized by significant shifts in mean and variance over time, whereas prediction targets adhere to a normal distribution. Furthermore, although multi-step forecasting and prediction offer a broader perspective and richer information compared to single-step approaches, it is much more challenging due to factors such as cumulative errors and long-term temporal variance. As a result, many previous works have tackled either single-step stock price forecasting or prediction instead. To address these issues, we introduce a novel model, termed Patched Channel Integration Encoder (PCIE), to tackle both stock price forecasting and prediction. In this model, we utilize multiple stock channels that cover both historical prices and price changes, and design a novel tokenization method to effectively embed these channels in a cross-channel and temporally efficient manner. Specifically, the tokenization process involves univariate patching and temporal learning with a channel-mixing encoder to reduce cumulative errors. Comprehensive experiments validate that PCIE outperforms current state-of-the-art models in forecast and prediction tasks."
2504.17354,"The effective contact area in rough surface contact plays a critical role in multi-physics phenomena such as wear, sealing, and thermal or electrical conduction. Although accurate numerical methods, like the Boundary Element Method (BEM), are available to compute this quantity, their high computational cost limits their applicability in multi-query contexts, such as uncertainty quantification, parameter identification, and multi-scale algorithms, where many repeated evaluations are required. This study proposes a surrogate modeling framework for predicting the effective contact area using fast-to-evaluate data-driven techniques. Various machine learning algorithms are trained on a precomputed dataset, where the inputs are the imposed load and statistical roughness parameters, and the output is the corresponding effective contact area. All models undergo hyperparameter optimization to enable fair comparisons in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, evaluated using established quantitative metrics. Among the models, the Kernel Ridge Regressor demonstrates the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, achieving high predictive accuracy, low prediction time, and minimal training overhead-making it a strong candidate for general-purpose surrogate modeling. The Gaussian Process Regressor provides an attractive alternative when uncertainty quantification is required, although it incurs additional computational cost due to variance estimation. The generalization capability of the Kernel Ridge model is validated on an unseen simulation scenario, confirming its ability to transfer to new configurations. Database generation constitutes the dominant cost in the surrogate modeling process. Nevertheless, the approach proves practical and efficient for multi-query tasks, even when accounting for this initial expense."
2504.17656,"Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges in the on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect conformational diversity. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers because of challenges in representation and dataset constraints. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first generative model designed specifically for polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone. polyGen combines graph-based encodings with a latent diffusion transformer using positional biased attention for realistic conformation generation. Given the limited dataset of 3,855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we incorporate joint training with small molecule data to enhance generation quality. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen overcomes the limitations of traditional crystal structure prediction methods for polymers, successfully generating realistic and diverse linear and branched conformations, with promising performance even on challenging large repeat units. As the first atomic-level proof-of-concept capturing intrinsic polymer flexibility, it marks a new capability in material structure generation."

2504.18461,"Geomagnetic storms are large-scale disturbances of the Earth's magnetosphere driven by solar wind interactions, posing significant risks to space-based and ground-based infrastructure. The Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) index quantifies geomagnetic storm intensity by measuring global magnetic field variations. This study applies symbolic regression to derive data-driven equations describing the temporal evolution of the Dst index. We use historical data from the NASA OMNIweb database, including solar wind density, bulk velocity, convective electric field, dynamic pressure, and magnetic pressure. The PySR framework, an evolutionary algorithm-based symbolic regression library, is used to identify mathematical expressions linking dDst/dt to key solar wind. The resulting models include a hierarchy of complexity levels and enable a comparison with well-established empirical models such as the Burton-McPherron-Russell and O'Brien-McPherron models. The best-performing symbolic regression models demonstrate superior accuracy in most cases, particularly during moderate geomagnetic storms, while maintaining physical interpretability. Performance evaluation on historical storm events includes the 2003 Halloween Storm, the 2015 St. Patrick's Day Storm, and a 2017 moderate storm. The results provide interpretable, closed-form expressions that capture nonlinear dependencies and thresholding effects in Dst evolution."
2504.18925,"Storage is a significant challenge in reconstructing dynamic scenes with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) data. In this work, we introduce 4DGS-CC, a contextual coding framework that compresses 4DGS data to meet specific storage constraints. Building upon the established deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method, our approach decomposes 4DGS data into 4D neural voxels and a canonical 3DGS component, which are then compressed using Neural Voxel Contextual Coding (NVCC) and Vector Quantization Contextual Coding (VQCC), respectively. Specifically, we first decompose the 4D neural voxels into distinct quantized features by separating the temporal and spatial dimensions. To losslessly compress each quantized feature, we leverage the previously compressed features from the temporal and spatial dimensions as priors and apply NVCC to generate the spatiotemporal context for contextual coding. Next, we employ a codebook to store spherical harmonics information from canonical 3DGS as quantized vectors, which are then losslessly compressed by using VQCC with the auxiliary learned hyperpriors for contextual coding, thereby reducing redundancy within the codebook. By integrating NVCC and VQCC, our contextual coding framework, 4DGS-CC, enables multi-rate 4DGS data compression tailored to specific storage requirements. Extensive experiments on three 4DGS data compression benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves an average storage reduction of approximately 12 times while maintaining rendering fidelity compared to our baseline 4DGS approach."
2504.19963,"This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics."
2504.20674,"The physics-based Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model, widely adopted for its precise electrochemical modeling, stands out among various simulation models of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Although the DFN model is powerful in forward predictive analysis, the inverse identification of its model parameters has remained a long-standing challenge. The numerous unknown parameters associated with the nonlinear, time-dependent, and multi-scale DFN model are extremely difficult to be determined accurately and efficiently, hindering the practical use of such battery simulation models in industrial applications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce DiffLiB, a high-fidelity finite-element-based LIB simulation framework, equipped with advanced differentiable programming techniques so that efficient gradient-based inverse parameter identification is enabled. Customized automatic differentiation rules are defined by identifying the VJP (vector-Jacobian product) structure in the chain rule and implemented using adjoint-based implicit differentiation methods. Four numerical examples, including both 2D and 3D forward predictions and inverse parameter identification, are presented to validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of DiffLiB. Benchmarking against COMSOL demonstrates excellent agreement in forward predictions, with terminal voltage discrepancies maintaining a root-mean-square error (RMSE) below 2 mV across all test conditions. In parameter identification tasks using experimentally measured voltage data, the proposed gradient-based optimization scheme achieves superior computational performance, with 96% fewer forward predictions and 72% less computational time compared with gradient-free approaches. These results demonstrate that DiffLiB is a versatile and powerful computational framework for the development of advanced LIBs."
2504.20861,"Two approaches to incorporate heterogeneity in discrete models are compared. In the first, standard approach, the heterogeneity is dictated by geometrical structure of the discrete system. In the second approach, the heterogeneity is imposed by randomizing material parameters of the contacts between the rigid bodies. A similar randomization strategy is often adopted in continuous homogeneous models. The study investigates both the elastic and fracture behaviors of these model types, and compares their local and macroscale responses. It is found that the stress oscillations present in the standard discrete models built on heterogeneous geometric structures cannot be replicated by randomization of the elastically homogeneous discrete system. The marginal distributions and dependencies between the stress tensor components cannot be adequately matched. Therefore, there is a fundamental difference between these two views on discrete models. The numerical experiments performed in the paper showed that an identical response can be achieved at the macroscale by tuning the material parameters. However, the local behavior, fracturing, and internal dependencies are quite different. These findings provide insight into the potential for controlled random assignment of heterogeneity in homogeneous models. They also demonstrate the need for experimental data capable of verifying the correctness of such an approach."
2504.21317,"The deployment of machine learning (ML)-based process monitoring systems has significantly advanced additive manufacturing (AM) by enabling real-time defect detection, quality assessment, and process optimization. However, redundancy is a critical yet often overlooked challenge in the deployment and operation of ML-based AM process monitoring systems. Excessive redundancy leads to increased equipment costs, compromised model performance, and high computational requirements, posing barriers to industrial adoption. However, existing research lacks a unified definition of redundancy and a systematic framework for its evaluation and mitigation. This paper defines redundancy in ML-based AM process monitoring and categorizes it into sample-level, feature-level, and model-level redundancy. A comprehensive multi-level redundancy mitigation (MLRM) framework is proposed, incorporating advanced methods such as data registration, downscaling, cross-modality knowledge transfer, and model pruning to systematically reduce redundancy while improving model performance. The framework is validated through an ML-based in-situ defect detection case study for directed energy deposition (DED), demonstrating a 91% reduction in latency, a 47% decrease in error rate, and a 99.4% reduction in storage requirements. Additionally, the proposed approach lowers sensor costs and energy consumption, enabling a lightweight, cost-effective, and scalable monitoring system. By defining redundancy and introducing a structured mitigation framework, this study establishes redundancy analysis and mitigation as a key enabler of efficient ML-based process monitoring in production environments."

The trust system constructed by blockchain technology based on cryptography algorithm and computing power provides a practical and powerful solution to solve the trust problem in human society.

2505.00176,"The rising demand for high-value electronics necessitates advanced manufacturing techniques capable of meeting stringent specifications for precise, complex, and compact devices, driving the shift toward innovative additive manufacturing (AM) solutions. Aerosol Jet Printing (AJP) is a versatile AM technique that utilizes aerosolized functional materials to accurately print intricate patterns onto diverse substrates. Machine learning (ML)- based Process-Structure-Property (PSP) modeling is essential for enhancing AJP manufacturing, as it quantitatively connects process parameters, structural features, and resulting material properties. However, current ML approaches for modeling PSP relationships in AJP face significant limitations in handling multimodal and multiscale data, underscoring a critical need for generative methods capable of comprehensive analysis through multimodal and multiscale fusion. To address this challenge, this study introduces a novel generative modeling methodology leveraging diffusion models for PSP data fusion in AJP. The proposed method integrates multimodal, multiscale PSP features in two phases: (1) registering the features, and (2) fusing them to generate causal relationships between PSP attributes. A case study demonstrates the registration and fusion of optical microscopy (OM) images and confocal profilometry (CP) data from AJP, along with the fine-tuning of the fusion step. The results effectively capture complex PSP relationships, offering deeper insights into digital twins of dynamic manufacturing systems."
2505.00468,"Achieving thermal comfort while maintaining energy efficiency is a critical objective in building system control. Conventional thermal comfort models, such as the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), rely on both environmental and personal variables. However, the use of fixed-location sensors limits the ability to capture spatial variability, which reduces the accuracy of occupant-specific comfort estimation. To address this limitation, this study proposes a new PMV estimation method that incorporates spatial environmental data reconstructed using the Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Gappy POD) algorithm. In addition, a group PMV-based control framework is developed to account for the thermal comfort of multiple occupants. The Gappy POD method enables fast and accurate reconstruction of indoor temperature fields from sparse sensor measurements. Using these reconstructed fields and occupant location data, spatially resolved PMV values are calculated. Group-level thermal conditions are then derived through statistical aggregation methods and used to control indoor temperature in a multi-occupant living lab environment. Experimental results show that the Gappy POD algorithm achieves an average relative error below 3\% in temperature reconstruction. PMV distributions varied by up to 1.26 scale units depending on occupant location. Moreover, thermal satisfaction outcomes varied depending on the group PMV method employed. These findings underscore the importance for adaptive thermal control strategies that incorporate both spatial and individual variability, offering valuable insights for future occupant-centric building operations."
2505.01047,"Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) offers a powerful paradigm of integrating data with physical laws to address important scientific problems, such as parameter estimation, inferring hidden physics, equation discovery, and state prediction, etc. However, PIML still faces many serious optimization challenges that significantly restrict its applications. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework that transforms PIML to convex optimization to overcome all these limitations, referred to as Convex-PIML. The linear combination of B-splines is utilized to approximate the data, promoting the convexity of the loss function. By replacing the non-convex components of the loss function with convex approximations, the problem is further converted into a sequence of successively refined approximated convex optimization problems. This conversion allows the use of well-established convex optimization algorithms, obtaining solutions effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, an adaptive knot optimization method based on error estimate is introduced to mitigate the spectral bias issue of PIML, further improving the performance. The proposed theoretically guaranteed framework is tested in scenarios with distinct types of physical prior. The results indicate that optimization problems are effectively solved in these scenarios, highlighting the potential of the framework for broad applications."

Establishing linkages between the vast design space of unit cells and their effective mechanical properties is critical for the efficient design and performance evaluation of such metamaterials. However, physics-based simulations of metamaterial unit cells across the entire design space are computationally expensive, necessitating a materials informatics framework to efficiently capture complex structure-property relationships. In this work, principal component analysis of 2-point correlation functions is performed to extract the salient features from a large dataset of randomly generated 2D metamaterials. Physics-based simulations are performed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based homogenization approach to efficiently compute the homogenized effective elastic stiffness across the extensive unit cell designs. Subsequently, Gaussian process regression is used to generate reduced-order surrogates, mapping unit cell designs to their homogenized effective elastic constant. It is demonstrated that the adopted workflow enables a high-value low-dimensional representation of the voluminous stochastic metamaterial dataset, facilitating the construction of robust structure-property maps. Finally, an uncertainty-based active learning framework is utilized to train a surrogate model with a significantly smaller number of data points compared to the original full dataset. It is shown that a dataset as small as $0.61\%$ of the entire dataset is sufficient to generate accurate and robust structure-property maps."
2505.01371,"Virtual studies of ICD behaviour are crucial for testing device functionality in a controlled environment prior to clinical application. Although previous works have shown the viability of using in silico testing for diagnosis, there is a notable gap in available models that can simulate therapy progression decisions during arrhythmic episodes. This work introduces SimICD, a simulation tool which combines virtual ICD logic algorithms with cardiac electrophysiology simulations in a feedback loop, allowing the progression of ICD therapy protocols to be simulated for a range of tachy-arrhythmia episodes. Using a cohort of virtual patients, we demonstrate the ability of SimICD to simulate realistic cardiac signals and ICD responses that align with the logic of real-world devices, facilitating the reprogramming of ICD parameters to adapt to specific episodes."
2505.01432,"This paper presents a comprehensive study on the integration of text-derived, time-varying sentiment factors into traditional multi-factor asset pricing models. Leveraging FinBERT, a domain-specific deep learning language model, we construct a dynamic sentiment index and its volatility from large-scale financial news and social media data covering 2020 to 2022. By embedding these sentiment measures into the Fama French five-factor regression, we rigorously examine whether sentiment significantly explains variations in daily stock returns and how its impact evolves across different market volatility regimes. Empirical results demonstrate that sentiment has a consistently positive impact on returns during normal periods, while its effect is amplified or even reversed under extreme market conditions. Rolling regressions reveal the time-varying nature of sentiment sensitivity, and an event study around the June 15, 2022 Federal Reserve 75 basis point rate hike shows that a sentiment-augmented five-factor model better explains abnormal returns relative to the baseline model. Our findings support the incorporation of high-frequency, NLP-derived sentiment into classical asset pricing frameworks and suggest implications for investors and regulators."
2505.01556,"Multivariate Statistical Process Control (MSPC) is a framework for monitoring and diagnosing complex processes by analysing the relationships between multiple process variables simultaneously. Kernel MSPC extends the methodology by leveraging kernel functions to capture non-linear relationships between the data, enhancing the process monitoring capabilities. However, optimising the kernel MSPC parameters, such as the kernel type and kernel parameters, is often done in literature in time-consuming and non-procedural manners such as cross-validation or grid search. In the present paper, we propose optimising the kernel MSPC parameters with Kernel Flows (KF), a recent kernel learning methodology introduced for Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). Apart from the optimisation technique, the novelty of the study resides also in the utilisation of kernel combinations for learning the optimal kernel type, and introduces individual kernel parameters for each variable. The proposed methodology is evaluated with multiple cases from the benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process. The faults are detected for all evaluated cases, including the ones not detected in the original study."
2505.01597,"Particle Flow Filters perform the measurement update by moving particles to a different location rather than modifying the particles' weight based on the likelihood. Their movement (flow) is dictated by a drift term, which continuously pushes the particle toward the posterior distribution, and a diffusion term, which guarantees the spread of particles. This work presents a novel derivation of these terms based on high-order polynomial expansions, where the common techniques based on linearization reduce to a simpler version of the new methodology. Thanks to differential algebra, the high-order particle flow is derived directly onto the polynomials representation of the distribution, embedded with differentiation and evaluation. The resulting technique proposes two new particle flow filters, whose difference relies on the selection of the expansion center for the Taylor polynomial evaluation. Numerical applications show the improvement gained by the inclusion of high-order terms, especially when comparing performance with the Gromov flow and the ""exact"" flow."
2505.01598,"Particle Flow Filters estimate the ``a posteriori"" probability density function (PDF) by moving an ensemble of particles according to the likelihood. Particles are propagated under the system dynamics until a measurement becomes available when each particle undergoes an additional stochastic differential equation in a pseudo-time that updates the distribution following a homotopy transformation. This flow of particles can be represented as a recursive update step of the filter. In this work, we leverage the Differential Algebra (DA) representation of the solution flow of dynamics to improve the computational burden of particle flow filters. Thanks to this approximation, both the prediction and the update differential equations are solved in the DA framework, creating two sets of polynomial maps: the first propagates particles forward in time while the second updates particles, achieving the flow. The final result is a new particle flow filter that rapidly propagates and updates PDFs using mathematics based on deviation vectors. Numerical applications show the benefits of the proposed technique, especially in reducing computational time, so that small systems such as CubeSats can run the filter for attitude determination."
2505.01781,"Modern portfolio construction demands robust methods for integrating data-driven insights into asset allocation. The Black-Litterman model offers a powerful Bayesian approach to adjust equilibrium returns using investor views to form a posterior expectation along with market priors. Mainstream research mainly generates subjective views through statistical models or machine learning methods, among which hybrid models combined with decomposition algorithms perform well. However, most hybrid models do not pay enough attention to noise, and time series decomposition methods based on single variables make it difficult to fully utilize information between multiple variables. Multivariate decomposition also has problems of low efficiency and poor component quality. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid forecasting model SSA-MAEMD-TCN to automate and improve the view generation process. The proposed model combines Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for denoising, Multivariate Aligned Empirical Mode Decomposition (MA-EMD) for frequency-aligned decomposition, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for deep sequence learning to capture complex temporal patterns across multiple financial indicators. Empirical tests on the Nasdaq 100 Index stocks show a significant improvement in forecasting performance compared to baseline models based on MAEMD and MEMD. The optimized portfolio performs well, with annualized returns and Sharpe ratios far exceeding those of the traditional portfolio over a short holding period, even after accounting for transaction costs."
2505.01871,"Surface roughness is a critical factor influencing the fatigue life of structural components. Its effect is commonly quantified using a correction coefficient known as the surface factor. In this paper, a phase field based numerical framework is proposed to estimate the surface factor while accounting for the stochastic nature of surface roughness. The model is validated against existing experimental data. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of key parameters on the fatigue life of rough surfaces, such as surface topology and failure strength. An important effect of surface roughness is observed when the average surface roughness increases and the correlation length of the surface profile decreases. This effect becomes more pronounced with higher failure strengths."
2505.02086,"A deep learning scheme is proposed to solve the electromagnetic (EM) scattering problems where the profile of the dielectric scatterer of interest is incomplete. As a compensation, a limited amount of scattering data is provided, which is in principle containing sufficient information associated with the missing part of the profile. The existing solvers can hardly realize the compensation if the known part of the profile and the scattering data are combined straightforwardly. On one hand, the well-developed forward solvers have no mechanism to accept the scattering data, which can recover the unknown part of the profile if properly used. On the other hand, the existing solvers for inverse problems cannot retrieve the complete profile with an acceptable accuracy from the limited amount of scattering data, even when the available part of the profile can be fed into the solvers. This work aims to handle the difficulty. To this end, the EM forward scattering from an incompletely known dielectric scatterer is derived. A scheme based on DL is then proposed where the forward and inverse scattering problems are solved simultaneously. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed DL-based scheme for both two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) EM scattering problems."
2505.02093,"Obtaining reliable permeability maps of oil reservoirs is crucial for building a robust and accurate reservoir simulation model and, therefore, designing effective recovery strategies. This problem, however, remains challenging, as it requires the integration of various data sources by experts from different disciplines. Moreover, there are no sources to provide direct information about the inter-well space. In this work, a new method based on the data-fusion approach is proposed for predicting two-dimensional permeability maps on the whole reservoir area. This method utilizes non-parametric regression with a custom kernel shape accounting for different data sources: well logs, well tests, and seismics. A convolutional neural network is developed to process seismic data and then incorporate it with other sources. A multi-stage data fusion procedure helps to artificially increase the training dataset for the seismic interpretation model and finally to construct the adequate permeability map. The proposed methodology of permeability map construction from different sources was tested on a real oil reservoir located in Western Siberia. The results demonstrate that the developed map perfectly corresponds to the permeability estimations in the wells, and the inter-well space permeability predictions are considerably improved through the incorporation of the seismic data."
2505.02139,"The Limit Order Book (LOB), the mostly fundamental data of the financial market, provides a fine-grained view of market dynamics while poses significant challenges in dealing with the esteemed deep models due to its strong autocorrelation, cross-feature constrains, and feature scale disparity. Existing approaches often tightly couple representation learning with specific downstream tasks in an end-to-end manner, failed to analyze the learned representations individually and explicitly, limiting their reusability and generalization. This paper conducts the first systematic comparative study of LOB representation learning, aiming to identify the effective way of extracting transferable, compact features that capture essential LOB properties. We introduce LOBench, a standardized benchmark with real China A-share market data, offering curated datasets, unified preprocessing, consistent evaluation metrics, and strong baselines. Extensive experiments validate the sufficiency and necessity of LOB representations for various downstream tasks and highlight their advantages over both the traditional task-specific end-to-end models and the advanced representation learning models for general time series. Our work establishes a reproducible framework and provides clear guidelines for future research. Datasets and code will be publicly available atthis https URL."
2505.0217,"Fantasy football is a billion-dollar industry with millions of participants. Under a fixed budget, managers select squads to maximize future Fantasy Premier League (FPL) points. This study formulates lineup selection as data-driven optimization and develops deterministic and robust mixed-integer linear programs that choose the starting eleven, bench, and captain under budget, formation, and club-quota constraints (maximum three players per club). The objective is parameterized by a hybrid scoring metric that combines realized FPL points with predictions from a linear regression model trained on match-performance features identified using exploratory data analysis techniques. The study benchmarks alternative objectives and cost estimators, including simple and recency-weighted averages, exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and Monte Carlo simulation. Experiments on the 2023/24 Premier League season show that ARIMA with a constrained budget and a rolling window yields the most consistent out-of-sample performance; weighted averages and Monte Carlo are also competitive. Robust variants improve some objectives but are not uniformly superior. The framework provides transparent decision support for fantasy roster construction and extends to FPL chips, multi-week rolling-horizon transfer planning, and week-by-week dynamic captaincy."
2505.02186,"When coping with the urgent challenge of locating and rescuing a deep-sea submersible in the event of communication or power failure, environmental uncertainty in the ocean can not be ignored. However, classic physical models are limited to deterministic scenarios. Therefore, we present a hybrid algorithm framework combined with dynamic analysis for target submarine, Monte Carlo and Bayesian method for conducting a probabilistic prediction to improve the search efficiency. Herein, the Monte Carlo is performed to overcome the environmental variability to improve the accuracy in location prediction. According to the trajectory prediction, we integrated the Bayesian based grid research and probabilistic updating. For more complex situations, we introduced the Bayesian filtering. Aiming to maximize the rate of successful rescue and costs, the economic optimization is performed utilizing the cost-benefit analysis based on entropy weight method and the CER is applied for evaluation."
2505.0245,"Predicting the dynamics of complex systems is crucial for various scientific and engineering applications. The accuracy of predictions depends on the model's ability to capture the intrinsic dynamics. While existing methods capture key dynamics by encoding a low-dimensional latent space, they overlook the inherent multiscale structure of complex systems, making it difficult to accurately predict complex spatiotemporal evolution. Therefore, we propose a Multiscale Diffusion Prediction Network (MDPNet) that leverages the multiscale structure of complex systems to discover the latent space of intrinsic dynamics. First, we encode multiscale features through a multiscale diffusion autoencoder to guide the diffusion model for reliable reconstruction. Then, we introduce an attention-based graph neural ordinary differential equation to model the co-evolution across different scales. Extensive evaluations on representative systems demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average prediction error reduction of 53.23% compared to baselines, while also exhibiting superior robustness and generalization."
2505.02606,"Efficient time series forecasting is essential for smart energy systems, enabling accurate predictions of energy demand, renewable resource availability, and grid stability. However, the growing volume of high-frequency data from sensors and IoT devices poses challenges for storage and transmission. This study explores Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)-based data compression as a solution to these challenges while ensuring forecasting accuracy. A case study of a seawater supply system in Hirtshals, Denmark, operating under dynamic weather, operational schedules, and seasonal trends, is used for evaluation.Biorthogonal wavelets of varying orders were applied to compress data at different rates. Three forecasting models - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), XGBoost, and the Time Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) - were tested to assess the impact of compression on forecasting performance. Lossy compression rates up to $r_{\mathrm{lossy}} = 0.999$ were analyzed, with the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) metric quantifying the relationship between compression and information retention. Results indicate that wavelet-based compression can retain essential features for accurate forecasting when applied carefully.XGBoost proved highly robust to compression artifacts, maintaining stable performance across diverse compression rates. In contrast, OLS demonstrated sensitivity to smooth wavelets and high compression rates, while TiDE showed some variability but remained competitive. This study highlights the potential of wavelet-based compression for scalable, efficient data management in smart energy systems without sacrificing forecasting accuracy. The findings are relevant to other fields requiring high-frequency time series forecasting, including climate modeling, water supply systems, and industrial operations."
2505.03067,"A novel parallel efficiency analysis on a framework for simulating the growth of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) tumours is presented. Proliferation of MPM tumours in the pleural space is simulated using a Cellular Potts Model (CPM) coupled with partial differential equations (PDEs). Using segmented lung data from CT scans, an environment is set up with artificial tumour data in the pleural space, representing the simulation domain, onto which a dynamic bounding box is applied to restrict computations to the region of interest, dramatically reducing memory and CPU overhead. This adaptive partitioning of the domain enables efficient use of computational resources by reducing the three-dimensional (3D) domain over which the PDEs are to be solved. The PDEs, representing oxygen, nutrients, and cytokines, are solved using the finite-volume method with a first-order implicit Euler scheme. Parallelization is realized using the public Python library mpi4py in combination with LinearGMRESSolver and PETSc for efficient convergence. Performance analyses have shown that parallelization achieves a reduced solving time compared to serial computation. Also, optimizations enable efficient use of available memory and improved load balancing amongst the cores."
2505.03188,"Reliable forecasts of the power output from variable renewable energy generators like solar photovoltaic systems are important to balancing load on real-time electricity markets and ensuring electricity supply reliability. However, solar PV power output is highly uncertain, with significant variations occurring over both longer (daily or seasonally) and shorter (within minutes) timescales due to weather conditions, especially cloud cover. This paper builds on existing work that uses convolutional neural networks in the computer vision task of predicting (in a Nowcast model) and forecasting (in a Forecast model) solar PV power output (Stanford EAO SUNSET Model). A pure transformer architecture followed by a fully-connected layer is applied to one year of image data with experiments run on various combinations of learning rate and batch size. We find that the transformer architecture performs almost as well as the baseline model in the PV output prediction task. However, it performs worse on sunny days."
2505.03415,"We create an data-efficient and accurate surrogate model for structure-property linkages of spinodoid metamaterials with only 75 data points -- far fewer than the several thousands used in prior works -- and demonstrate its use in multi-objective inverse design. The inverse problem of finding a material microstructure that leads to given bulk properties is of great interest in mechanics and materials science. These inverse design tasks often require a large dataset, which can become unaffordable when considering material behavior that requires more expensive simulations or experiments. We generate a data-efficient surrogate for the mapping between the characteristics of the local material structure and the effective elasticity tensor and use it to inversely design structures with multiple objectives simultaneously. The presented neural network-based surrogate model achieves its data efficiency by inherently satisfying certain requirements, such as equivariance with respect to permutations of structure parameters, which avoids having to learn them from data. The resulting surrogate of the forward model is differentiable, allowing its direct use in gradient-based optimization for the inverse design problem. We demonstrate in three inverse design tasks of varying complexity that this approach yields reliable results while requiring significantly less training data than previous approaches based on neural-network surrogates. This paves the way for inverse design involving nonlinear mechanical behavior, where data efficiency is currently the limiting factor."
2505.03438,"Numerous algorithms and parallelisations have been developed for short-range particle simulations; however, none are optimally performant for all scenarios. Such a concept led to the prior development of the particle simulation library AutoPas, which implemented many of these algorithms and parallelisations and could select and tune these over the course of the simulation as the scenario changed. Prior works have, however, used only naive approaches to the algorithm selection problem, which can lead to significant overhead from trialling poorly performing algorithmic configurations.In this work, we investigate this problem in the case of Molecular Dynamics simulations. We present three algorithm selection strategies: an approach which makes performance predictions from past data, an expert-knowledge fuzzy logic-based approach, and a data-driven random forest-based approach. We demonstrate that these approaches can achieve speedups of up to 4.05 compared to prior approaches and 1.25 compared to a perfect configuration selection without dynamic algorithm selection. In addition, we discuss the practicality of the strategies in comparison to their performance, to highlight the tractability of such solutions."
2505.04018,"Modal identification is crucial for structural health monitoring and structural control, providing critical insights into structural dynamics and performance. This study presents a novel deep learning framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and a physics-informed loss function to achieve modal decomposition and identification across a population of structures. The transformer module decomposes multi-degrees-of-freedom (MDOF) structural dynamic measurements into single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) modal responses, facilitating the identification of natural frequencies and damping ratios. Concurrently, the GNN captures the structural configurations and identifies mode shapes corresponding to the decomposed SDOF modal responses. The proposed model is trained in a purely physics-informed and unsupervised manner, leveraging modal decomposition theory and the independence of structural modes to guide learning without the need for labeled data. Validation through numerical simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrates its effectiveness in accurately decomposing dynamic responses and identifying modal properties from sparse structural dynamic measurements, regardless of variations in external loads or structural configurations. Comparative analyses against established modal identification techniques and model variations further underscore its superior performance, positioning it as a favorable approach for population-based structural health monitoring."
2505.04353,"This study presents an extension of multiscale topology optimization by integrating both yield stress and local/global buckling considerations into the design process. Building upon established multiscale methodologies, we develop a new framework incorporating yield stress limits either as constraints or objectives alongside previously established local and global buckling constraints. This approach significantly refines the optimization process, ensuring that the resulting designs meet mechanical performance criteria and adhere to critical material yield constraints. First, we establish local density-dependent von Mises yield surfaces based on local yield estimates from homogenization-based analysis to predict the local yield limits of the homogenized materials. Then, these local Yield-based Load Factors (YLFs) are combined with local and global buckling criteria to obtain topology optimized designs that consider yield and buckling failure on all levels. This integration is crucial for the practical application of optimized structures in real-world scenarios, where material yield and stability behavior critically influence structural integrity and durability. Numerical examples demonstrate how optimized designs depend on the stiffness to yield ratio of the considered building material. Despite the foundational assumption of separation of scales, the de-homogenized structures, even at relatively coarse length scales, exhibit a high degree of agreement with the corresponding homogenized predictions."
2505.04361,"Truth discovery (TD) plays an important role in Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS). However, existing TD methods, including privacy-preserving TD approaches, estimate the truth by weighting only the data submitted in the current round, which often results in low data quality. Moreover, there is a lack of effective TD methods that preserve both reputation and data privacy. To address these issues, a Reputation and Data Privacy-Preserving based Truth Discovery (RDPP-TD) scheme is proposed to obtain high-quality data for MCS. The RDPP-TD scheme consists of two key approaches: a Reputation-based Truth Discovery (RTD) approach, which integrates the weight of current-round data with workers' reputation values to estimate the truth, thereby achieving more accurate results, and a Reputation and Data Privacy-Preserving (RDPP) approach, which ensures privacy preservation for sensing data and reputation values. First, the RDPP approach, when seamlessly integrated with RTD, can effectively evaluate the reliability of workers and their sensing data in a privacy-preserving manner. Second, the RDPP scheme supports reputation-based worker recruitment and rewards, ensuring high-quality data collection while incentivizing workers to provide accurate information. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed RDPP-TD scheme provides strong privacy protection and improves data quality by up to 33.3%."
2505.04875,"One use case of ``physics-informed neural networks'' (PINNs) is solution reconstruction, which aims to estimate the full-field state of a physical system from sparse measurements. Parameterized governing equations of the system are used in tandem with the measurements to regularize the regression problem. However, in real-world solution reconstruction problems, the parameterized governing equation may be inconsistent with the physical phenomena that give rise to the measurement data. We show that due to assuming consistency between the true and parameterized physics, PINNs-based approaches may fail to satisfy three basic criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency. As we argue, these criteria ensure that (i) the quality of the reconstruction can be assessed, (ii) the reconstruction does not depend strongly on the choice of physics loss, and (iii) that in certain situations, the physics parameters can be uniquely recovered. In the context of elasticity and heat transfer, we demonstrate how standard formulations of the physics loss and techniques for constraining the solution to respect the measurement data lead to different ``constraint forces"" -- which we define as additional source terms arising from the constraints -- and that these constraint forces can significantly influence the reconstructed solution. To avoid the potentially substantial influence of the choice of physics loss and method of constraint enforcement on the reconstructed solution, we propose the ``explicit constraint force method'' (ECFM) to gain control of the source term introduced by the constraint. We then show that by satisfying the criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency, this approach leads to more predictable and customizable reconstructions from noisy measurement data, even when the parameterization of the missing physics is inconsistent with the measured system."
2505.05236,"A common technique used in factories to shape metal panels is shot peen forming. The impacts between the hard steel shot and the softer metal of the panel cause localized plastic deformation used to improve the fatigue properties of the material's surface. The residual stress distribution imparted by impacts also results in bending, which suggests that a torque is associated with it. In this paper, we model shot peen forming as the application of spatially varying torques to a Kirchhoff plate, opting to use the language of thermoelasticity in order to introduce these torque distributions. First, we derive the governing equations for the thermoelastic thin plate model and show that only a torque-type resultant of the temperature distribution shows up in the bending equation. Next, to calibrate from the shot peen operation an empirical effective torque parameter used in the thermoelastic model, a simple and non-invasive test is devised. This test relies only on measuring the maximum displacement of a uniformly shot peened plate as opposed to characterizing the residual stress distribution. After discussing how to handle the unconventional fully-free boundary conditions germane for peened plates, we introduce an approach to solving the inverse problem whereby the peening distribution required to obtain a specified plate contour can be obtained. Given the non-unique relationship between peening distributions and the displacement at discrete points, we explore a regularization of the inverse problem which gives rise to shot peen distributions that match the capabilities of equipment in the factory. In order to validate our proposed model, an experiment with quantified uncertainty is designed and carried out which investigates the agreement between the predictions of the calibrated model and real shot peen forming operations."
2505.05325,"Predicting stock market movements remains a persistent challenge due to the inherently volatile, non-linear, and stochastic nature of financial time series data. This paper introduces a deep learning-based framework employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast the closing stock prices of major technology firms: Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, listed on NASDAQ. Historical data was sourced from Yahoo Finance and processed using normalization and feature engineering techniques. The proposed model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.72 on unseen test data, significantly outperforming traditional models like ARIMA. To further enhance predictive accuracy, sentiment scores were integrated using real-time news articles and social media data, analyzed through the VADER sentiment analysis tool. A web application was also developed to provide real-time visualizations of stock price forecasts, offering practical utility for both individual and institutional investors. This research demonstrates the strength of LSTM networks in modeling complex financial sequences and presents a novel hybrid approach combining time series modeling with sentiment analysis."
2505.05723,"This work presents a novel unfitted finite element framework to simulate coupled surface-bulk problems in time-dependent domains, focusing on fluid-fluid interactions in animal cells between the actomyosin cortex and the cytoplasm. The cortex, a thin layer beneath the plasma membrane, provides structural integrity and drives shape changes by generating surface contractile forces akin to tension. Cortical contractions generate Marangoni-like surface flows and induce intracellular cytoplasmic flows that are essential for processes such as cell division, migration, and polarization, particularly in large animal cells. Despite its importance, the spatiotemporal regulation of cortex-cytoplasm interactions remains poorly understood and computational modelling can be very challenging because surface-bulk dynamics often lead to large cell deformations. To address these challenges, we propose a sharp-interface framework that uniquely combines the trace finite element method for surface flows with the aggregated finite element method for bulk flows. This approach enables accurate and stable simulations on fixed Cartesian grids without remeshing. The model also incorporates mechanochemical feedback through the surface transport of a molecular regulator of active tension. We solve the resulting mixed-dimensional system on a fixed Cartesian grid using a level-set-based method to track the evolving surface. Numerical experiments validate the accuracy and stability of the method, capturing phenomena such as self-organised pattern formation, curvature-driven relaxation, and cell cleavage. This novel framework offers a powerful and extendable tool for investigating increasingly complex morphogenetic processes in animal cells."
2505.06294,"The collapse of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) panels has attracted considerable public and academic interest. As detailed experimental data are not yet available and replicating the natural corrosion process requires years or decades, computational modelling is essential to understand under which conditions corrosion remains concealed. The very high porosity of RAAC is widely suspected to be a major contributing factor. However, current corrosion-induced cracking models are known to struggle with capturing the role of concrete porosity. To remedy this critical deficiency, we propose to enrich corrosion-induced cracking modelling with the analytical solution of reactive transport equations governing the precipitation of rust and a porosity-dependent description of diffusivity. With this, the corrosion concealment in RAAC panels is studied computationally for the first time, revealing that RAAC panels can suddenly collapse before any warning of corrosion-induced surface cracking and allowing to map the conditions most likely to result in sudden collapse."
2505.06408,"Recent advances in reinforcement learning, such as Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), show strong performance when paired with large language models (LLMs).

2505.06908,"This paper proposes a ternary signalling scheme for inductive coupling links (ICLs) in 3D-integrated circuits (3D-ICs) to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic interference in multi-stacked chip communications. By converting binary data into ternary sequences with three voltage levels (-V, 0V, +V), the approach enhances signal separation, reduces crosstalk, and improves signal integrity. Unlike traditional Non-Return to Zero (NRZ) systems, the ternary scheme increases bandwidth efficiency and reduces power consumption through fewer signal transitions. A modified H-Bridge transmitter generates ternary symbols by controlling current flow based on binary-to-ternary mapping. Preliminary simulations validate the efficiency of the scheme, showing reduced power consumption and higher data rates compared to NRZ. This approach shows promise for high-performance computing and IoT devices in 3D-IC environments, offering enhanced noise resilience, lower power usage, and improved communication efficiency."
2505.0766,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated remarkable success across various applications. In light of this trend, the field of automated trading has developed a keen interest in leveraging AI techniques to forecast the future prices of financial assets. This interest stems from the need to address trading challenges posed by the inherent volatility and dynamic nature of asset prices. However, crafting a flawless strategy becomes a formidable task when dealing with assets characterized by intricate and ever-changing price dynamics. To surmount these formidable challenges, this research employs an innovative rule-based strategy approach to train Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This application is carried out specifically in the context of trading Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP). Our proposed approach hinges on the integration of Deep Q-Network, Double Deep Q-Network, Dueling Deep Q-learning networks, alongside the Advantage Actor-Critic algorithms. Each of them aims to yield an optimal policy for our application. To evaluate the effectiveness of our Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach, we rely on portfolio wealth and the trade signal as performance metrics.

2505.08316,"Based on the concept that ventral visual stream (VVS) mainly functions for object recognition, current unsupervised task-driven methods model VVS by contrastive learning, and have achieved good brain similarity. However, we believe functions of VVS extend beyond just object recognition. In this paper, we introduce an additional function involving VVS, named relative position (RP) prediction. We first theoretically explain contrastive learning may be unable to yield the model capability of RP prediction. Motivated by this, we subsequently integrate RP learning with contrastive learning, and propose a new unsupervised task-driven method to model VVS, which is more inline with biological reality. We conduct extensive experiments, demonstrating that: (i) our method significantly improves downstream performance of object recognition while enhancing RP predictivity; (ii) RP predictivity generally improves the model brain similarity. Our results provide strong evidence for the involvement of VVS in location perception (especially RP prediction) from a computational perspective."
2505.08645,"This manuscript presents an approach for simultaneously optimizing the connectivity and elevation of grid-shell structures acting in pure compression (or pure tension) under the combined effects of a prescribed external loading and the design-dependent self-weight of the structure itself. The method derived herein involves solving a second-order cone optimization problem, thereby ensuring convexity and obtaining globally optimal results for a given discretization of the design domain. Several numerical examples are presented, illustrating characteristics of this class of optimal structures. It is found that, as self-weight becomes more significant, both the optimal topology and the optimal elevation profile of the structure change, highlighting the importance of optimizing both topology and geometry simultaneously from the earliest stages of design. It is shown that this approach can obtain solutions with greater accuracy and several orders of magnitude more quickly than a standard 3D layout/truss topology optimization approach."
2505.08927,"Quantifying the uncertainty in predictive models is critical for establishing trust and enabling risk-informed decision making for personalized medicine. In contrast to one-size-fits-all approaches that seek to mitigate risk at the population level, digital twins enable personalized modeling thereby potentially improving individual patient outcomes. Realizing digital twins in biomedicine requires scalable and efficient methods to integrate patient data with mechanistic models of disease progression. This study develops an end-to-end data-to-decisions methodology that combines longitudinal non-invasive imaging data with mechanistic models to estimate and predict spatiotemporal tumor progression accounting for patient-specific anatomy. Through the solution of a statistical inverse problem, imaging data inform the spatially varying parameters of a reaction-diffusion model of tumor progression. An efficient parallel implementation of the forward model coupled with a scalable approximation of the Bayesian posterior distribution enables rigorous, but tractable, quantification of uncertainty due to the sparse, noisy measurements. The methodology is verified on a virtual patient with synthetic data to control for model inadequacy, noise level, and the frequency of data collection. The application to decision-making is illustrated by evaluating the importance of imaging frequency and formulating an optimal experimental design question. The clinical relevance is demonstrated through a model validation study on a cohort of patients with publicly available longitudinal imaging data."
2505.09373,"Asymptotic post-buckling theory is applied to sizing and topology optimization of trusses and frames, exploring its potential and current computational difficulties. We show that a designs' post-buckling response can be controlled by including the lowest two asymptotic coefficients, representing the initial post-buckling slope and curvature, in the optimization formulation. This also reduces the imperfection sensitivity of the optimized design. The asymptotic expansion can further be used to approximate the structural nonlinear response, and then to optimize for a given measure of the nonlinear mechanical performance such as, for example, end-compliance or complementary work. Examples of linear and nonlinear compliance minimization of trusses and frames show the effective use of the asymptotic method for including post-buckling constraints in structural optimization."
2505.09489,"Exposure to elevated radon levels in the home is one of the leading causes of lung cancer in the world. The following study describes the creation of a comprehensive, state-level dataset designed to enable the modeling and prediction of household radon concentrations at Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) and sub-kilometer scales. Details include the data collection and processing involved in compiling physical and demographic factors for Pennsylvania and Utah. Attempting to mitigate this risk requires identifying the underlying geological causes and the populations that might be at risk. This work focuses on identifying at-risk populations throughout Pennsylvania and Utah, where radon levels are some of the highest in the country. The resulting dataset harmonizes geological and demographic factors from various sources and spatial resolutions, including temperature, geochemistry, and soil characteristics. Demographic variables such as the household heating fuel used, the age of building, and the housing type provide further insight into which populations could be most susceptible in areas with potentially high radon levels. This dataset also serves as a foundational resource for two other studies conducted by the authors. The resolution of the data provides a novel approach to predicting potential radon exposure, and the data processing conducted for these states can be scaled up to larger spatial resolutions (e.g., the Contiguous United States [CONUS]) and allow for a broad reclassification of radon exposure potential in the United States."

2505.09977,"Disordered materials such as glasses, unlike crystals, lack long range atomic order and have no periodic unit cells, yielding a high dimensional configuration space with widely varying properties. The complexity not only increases computational costs for atomistic simulations but also makes it difficult for generative AI models to deliver accurate property predictions and realistic structure generation. In this work, we introduce GlassVAE, a hierarchical graph variational autoencoder that uses graph representations to learn compact, rotation, translation, and permutation invariant embeddings of atomic configurations. The resulting structured latent space not only enables efficient generation of novel, physically plausible structures but also supports exploration of the glass energy landscape. To enforce structural realism and physical fidelity, we augment GlassVAE with two physics informed regularizers, a radial distribution function (RDF) loss that captures characteristic short and medium range ordering and an energy regression loss that reflects the broad configurational energetics. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results highlight the critical impact of these regularizers. By encoding high dimensional atomistic data into a compact latent vector and decoding it into structures with accurate energy predictions, GlassVAE provides a fast, physics aware path for modeling and designing disordered materials."

2505.10168,"This paper presents Space-Time MultiGrid (STMG) methods which are suitable for performing topology optimisation of transient heat conduction problems. The proposed methods use a pointwise smoother and uniform Cartesian space-time meshes. For problems with high contrast in the diffusivity, it was found that it is beneficial to define a coarsening strategy based on the geometric mean of the minimum and maximum diffusivity. However, other coarsening strategies may be better for other smoothers. Several methods of discretising the coarse levels were tested. Of these, it was best to use a method which averages the thermal resistivities on the finer levels. However, this was likely a consequence of the fact that only one spatial dimension was considered for the test problems. A second coarsening strategy was proposed which ensures spatial resolution on the coarse grids. Mixed results were found for this strategy. The proposed STMG methods were used as a solver for a one-dimensional topology optimisation problem. In this context, the adjoint problem was also solved using the STMG methods. The STMG methods were sufficiently robust for this application, since they converged during every optimisation cycle. It was found that the STMG methods also work for the adjoint problem when the prolongation operator only sends information forwards in time, even although the direction of time for the adjoint problem is backwards."

2505.11065,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable capabilities across financial tasks, including financial report summarization, earnings call transcript analysis, and asset classification. However, their real-world effectiveness in managing complex fund investment remains inadequately assessed. A fundamental limitation of existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM-driven trading strategies is their reliance on historical back-testing, inadvertently enabling LLMs to ""time travel""-leveraging future information embedded in their training corpora, thus resulting in possible information leakage and overly optimistic performance estimates. To address this issue, we introduce DeepFund, a live fund benchmark tool designed to rigorously evaluate LLM in real-time market conditions. Utilizing a multi-agent architecture, DeepFund connects directly with real-time stock market data-specifically data published after each model pretraining cutoff-to ensure fair and leakage-free evaluations. Empirical tests on nine flagship LLMs from leading global institutions across multiple investment dimensions-including ticker-level analysis, investment decision-making, portfolio management, and risk control-reveal significant practical challenges. Notably, even cutting-edge models such as DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet incur net trading losses within DeepFund real-time evaluation environment, underscoring the present limitations of LLMs for active fund management. Our code is available atthis https URL."
2505.11194,"Predicting protein function from sequence is a central challenge in computational biology. While existing methods rely heavily on structured ontologies or similarity-based techniques, they often lack the flexibility to express structure-free functional descriptions and novel biological functions. In this work, we introduce Prot2Text-V2, a novel multimodal sequence-to-text model that generates free-form natural language descriptions of protein function directly from amino acid sequences. Our method combines a protein language model as a sequence encoder (ESM-3B) and a decoder-only language model (LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct) through a lightweight nonlinear modality projector. A key innovation is our Hybrid Sequence-level Contrastive Alignment Learning (H-SCALE), which improves cross-modal learning by matching mean- and std-pooled protein embeddings with text representations via contrastive loss. After the alignment phase, we apply instruction-based fine-tuning using LoRA on the decoder to teach the model how to generate accurate protein function descriptions conditioned on the protein sequence. We train Prot2Text-V2 on about 250K curated entries from SwissProt and evaluate it under low-homology conditions, where test sequences have low similarity with training samples. Prot2Text-V2 consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across various metrics."
2505.1189,"Accurately forecasting electricity price volatility is crucial for effective risk management and decision-making. Traditional forecasting models often fall short in capturing the complex, non-linear dynamics of electricity markets, particularly when external factors like weather conditions and market volatility are involved. These limitations hinder their ability to provide reliable predictions in markets with high volatility, such as the New South Wales (NSW) electricity market. To address these challenges, we introduce FAEP, a Feature-Augmented Electricity Price Prediction framework. FAEP leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with advanced feature engineering to enhance prediction accuracy. By incorporating external features such as weather data and price volatility jumps, and utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for effective feature extraction, FAEP overcomes the shortcomings of traditional approaches. A hybrid XGBoost-LSTM model in FAEP further refines these augmented features, resulting in a more robust prediction framework. Experimental results demonstrate that FAEP achieves state-of-art (SOTA) performance compared to other electricity price prediction models in the Australian New South Wale electricity market, showcasing the efficiency of LLM-enhanced feature engineering and hybrid machine learning architectures."
2505.1194,"Discovering governing equations from scientific data is crucial for understanding the evolution of systems, and is typically framed as a search problem within a candidate equation space. However, the high-dimensional nature of dynamical systems leads to an exponentially expanding equation space, making the search process extremely challenging. The visual perception and pre-trained scientific knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLM) hold promise for providing effective navigation in high-dimensional equation spaces. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot method based on MLLM for automatically discovering physical coordinates and governing equations from high-dimensional data. Specifically, we design a series of enhanced visual prompts for MLLM to enhance its spatial perception. In addition, MLLM's domain knowledge is employed to navigate the search process within the equation space. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two representative types of systems demonstrate that the proposed method effectively discovers the physical coordinates and equations from both simulated and real experimental data, with long-term extrapolation accuracy improved by approximately 26.96% compared to the baseline."
2505.12333,"Decline-curve analysis (DCA) is a widely utilized method for production forecasting and estimating remaining reserves in gas reservoir. Based on the assumptions that past production trend can be mathematically characterized and used to predict future performance. It relies on historical production data and assumes that production methods remain unchanged throughout the analysis. This method is particularly valuable due to its accuracy in forecasting and its broad acceptance within the industry. Wells in the same geographical area and producing from similar geological formations often exhibit similar decline curve parameters. This study applies DCA to forecast the future production performance and estimate the ultimate recovery for the Semutang gas field's well 5 in Bangladesh. Using historical production data, decline curves were generated based on exponential, hyperbolic, and harmonic model equations. The cumulative production estimations were 11,139.34 MMSCF for the exponential model, 11,620.26 MMSCF for the hyperbolic model, and 14,021.92 MMSCF for the harmonic model. In terms of the well's productive life, the estimates were 335.13 days, 1,152 days, and 22,611 days, respectively. Among these models, the hyperbolic decline provided the most realistic forecast, closely aligning with observed production trend. The study highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate decline model for accurate production forecasting and reserve estimation, which is essential for effective reservoir management and resource optimization."
2505.12607,"For seismic analysis in engineering structures, it is essential to consider the dynamic responses under seismic excitation, necessitating the description of seismic accelerations. Limit seismics samples lead to incomplete uncertainty information, which is described by the non-probabilistic method reasonable. This study employs the minimum interval radius-based interval process (MRIP) based on the convex model to describe the time-variant uncertain seismic acceleration, subsequently conducting uncertainty analysis for seismic structures. However, the Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty analysis requires extensive deterministic computations to ensure accuracy, exhibiting poor computational efficiency. To address this issue, this paper first improves the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) through the dynamic evolution sequence, proposing DES-ES, whose efficiency is validated to be higher than that of CMA-ES. Furthermore, leveraging the dependency of the responses, a computational framework named DES-ES-SS is proposed. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DES-ES-SS improves computational efficiency while maintaining the accuracy of the interval uncertainty analysis of the seismic structures whether the seismic acceleration is stationary or non-stationary."
2505.12646,"Differentiable programming is revolutionizing computational science by enabling automatic differentiation (AD) of numerical simulations. While first-order gradients are well-established, second-order derivatives (Hessians) for implicit functions in finite-element-based differentiable physics remain underexplored. This work bridges this gap by deriving and implementing a framework for implicit Hessian computation in PDE-constrained optimization problems. We leverage primitive AD tools (Jacobian-vector product/vector-Jacobian product) to build an algorithm for Hessian-vector products and validate the accuracy against finite difference approximations. Four benchmarks spanning linear/nonlinear, 2D/3D, and single/coupled-variable problems demonstrate the utility of second-order information. Results show that the Newton-CG method with exact Hessians accelerates convergence for nonlinear inverse problems (e.g., traction force identification, shape optimization), while the L-BFGS-B method suffices for linear cases. Our work provides a robust foundation for integrating second-order implicit differentiation into differentiable physics engines, enabling faster and more reliable optimization."
2505.13919,"Data-driven methods offer an effective equation-free solution for predicting physical dynamics. However, the same physical system can exhibit significantly different dynamic behaviors in various environments. This causes prediction functions trained for specific environments to fail when transferred to unseen environments. Therefore, cross-environment prediction requires modeling the dynamic functions of different environments. In this work, we propose a model weight generation method, \texttt{EnvAd-Diff}. \texttt{EnvAd-Diff} operates in the weight space of the dynamic function, generating suitable weights from scratch based on environmental condition for zero-shot prediction. Specifically, we first train expert prediction functions on dynamic trajectories from a limited set of visible environments to create a model zoo, thereby constructing sample pairs of prediction function weights and their corresponding environments. Subsequently, we train a latent space diffusion model conditioned on the environment to model the joint distribution of weights and environments. Considering the lack of environmental prior knowledge in real-world scenarios, we propose a physics-informed surrogate label to distinguish different environments. Generalization experiments across multiple systems demonstrate that a 1M parameter prediction function generated by \texttt{EnvAd-Diff} outperforms a pre-trained 500M parameter foundation model."
2505.1405,"Algorithmic trading has long been an opaque, fragmented domain, guarded by secrecy and built around proprietary systems. In contrast to the open, collaborative evolution in fields like machine learning or software engineering, the algorithmic trading ecosystem has been slow to adopt reproducibility, standardization, and shared infrastructure.

PLUTUS combines a reproducibility standard, a modular development framework, and a growing suite of community-built reference strategies. The project provides a systematic approach to designing, testing, and documenting trading algorithms, regardless of the user's technical or financial background.

2505.14115,"A novel mixed-hybrid method for Kirchhoff-Love shells is proposed that enables the use of classical, possibly higher-order Lagrange elements in numerical analyses. In contrast to purely displacement-based formulations that require higher continuity of shape functions as in IGA, the mixed formulation features displacements and moments as primary unknowns. Thereby the continuity requirements are reduced, allowing equal-order interpolations of the displacements and moments. Hybridization enables an element-wise static condensation of the degrees of freedom related to the moments, at the price of introducing (significantly less) rotational degrees of freedom acting as Lagrange multipliers to weakly enforce the continuity of tangential moments along element edges. The mixed model is formulated coordinate-free based on the Tangential Differential Calculus, making it applicable for explicitly and implicitly defined shell geometries. All mechanically relevant boundary conditions are considered. Numerical results confirm optimal higher-order convergence rates whenever the mechanical setup allows for sufficiently smooth solutions; new benchmark test cases of this type are proposed."
2505.14546,"Objective: Global Maxwell Tomography (GMT) is a noninvasive inverse optimization method for the estimation of electrical properties (EP) from magnetic resonance (MR) measurements. GMT uses the volume integral equation (VIE) in the forward problem and assumes that the sample has negligible effect on the coil currents. Consequently, GMT calculates the coil's incident fields with an initial EP distribution and keeps them constant for all optimization iterations. This can lead to erroneous reconstructions. This work introduces a novel version of GMT that replaces VIE with the volume-surface integral equation (VSIE), which recalculates the coil currents at every iteration based on updated EP estimates before computing the associated fields. Methods: We simulated an 8-channel transceiver coil array for 7 T brain imaging and reconstructed the EP of a realistic head model using VSIE-based GMT. We built the coil, collected experimental MR measurements, and reconstructed EP of a two-compartment phantom. Results: In simulations, VSIE-based GMT outperformed VIE-based GMT by at least 12% for both EP. In experiments, the relative difference with respect to probe-measured EP values in the inner (outer) compartment was 13% (26%) and 17% (33%) for the permittivity and conductivity, respectively. Conclusion: The use of VSIE over VIE enhances GMT's performance by accounting for the effect of the EP on the coil currents. Significance: VSIE-based GMT does not rely on an initial EP estimate, rendering it more suitable for experimental reconstructions compared to the VIE-based GMT."
2505.14701,"Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the transition from nucleate to film boiling, where heat transfer to the working fluid can rapidly deteriorate. Accurate CHF prediction is essential for efficiency, safety, and preventing equipment damage, particularly in nuclear reactors. Although widely used, empirical correlations frequently exhibit discrepancies in comparison with experimental data, limiting their reliability in diverse operational conditions. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated the potential for CHF prediction but have often suffered from limited interpretability, data scarcity, and insufficient knowledge of physical principles. Hybrid model approaches, which combine data-driven ML with physics-based models, mitigate these concerns by incorporating prior knowledge of the domain. This study integrated a purely data-driven ML model and two hybrid models (using the Biasi and Bowring CHF correlations) within the CTF subchannel code via a custom Fortran framework. Performance was evaluated using two validation cases: a subset of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission CHF database and the Bennett dryout experiments. In both cases, the hybrid models exhibited significantly lower error metrics in comparison with conventional empirical correlations. The pure ML model remained competitive with the hybrid models. Trend analysis of error parity indicates that ML-based models reduce the tendency for CHF overprediction, improving overall accuracy. These results demonstrate that ML-based CHF models can be effectively integrated into subchannel codes and can potentially increase performance in comparison with conventional methods."
2505.15315,"Crystal structures are defined by the periodic arrangement of atoms in 3D space, inherently making them equivariant to SO(3) group. A fundamental requirement for crystal property prediction is that the model's output should remain invariant to arbitrary rotational transformations of the input structure. One promising strategy to achieve this invariance is to align the given crystal structure into a canonical orientation with appropriately computed rotations, or called frames. However, existing work either only considers a global frame or solely relies on more advanced local frames based on atoms' local structure. A global frame is too coarse to capture the local structure heterogeneity of the crystal, while local frames may inadvertently disrupt crystal symmetry, limiting their expressivity. In this work, we revisit the frame design problem for crystalline materials and propose a novel approach to construct expressive Symmetry-Preserving Frames, dubbed as SPFrame, for modeling crystal structures. Specifically, this local-global associative frame constructs invariant local frames rather than equivariant ones, thereby preserving the symmetry of the crystal. In parallel, it integrates global structural information to construct an equivariant global frame to enforce SO(3) invariance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SPFrame consistently outperforms traditional frame construction techniques and existing crystal property prediction baselines across multiple benchmark tasks."
2505.1569,"Is natural-language-driven earth observation data analysis now feasible with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs)? For open science in service of public interest, feasibility requires reliably high accuracy, interactive latencies, low (sustainable) costs, open LLMs, and openly maintainable software -- hence, the challenge. What are the techniques and programming system requirements necessary for satisfying these constraints, and what is the corresponding development and maintenance burden in practice? This study lays the groundwork for exploring these questions, introducing an impactful earth science use-case, and providing a software framework with evaluation data and metrics, along with initial results from employing model scaling, prompt-optimization, and inference-time scaling optimization techniques. While we attain high accuracy (near 100%) across 10 of 11 metrics, the analysis further considers cost (token-spend), latency, and maintainability across this space of techniques. Finally, we enumerate opportunities for further research, general programming and evaluation framework development, and ongoing work for a comprehensive, deployable solution. This is a call for collaboration and contribution."
2505.16296,"In this study, we present a finite element solver for a thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model that accurately captures multicomponent ionic transport by incorporating key physical phenomena such as steric effects, solvation, and pressure coupling. The model is rooted in the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and strictly enforces mass conservation, charge neutrality, and entropy production. It extends beyond classical frameworks like the Nernst-Planck system by employing modified partial mass balances, the electrostatic Poisson equation, and a momentum balance expressed in terms of electrostatic potential, atomic fractions, and pressure, thereby enhancing numerical stability and physical consistency. Implemented using the FEniCSx platform, the solver efficiently handles one- and two-dimensional problems with varied boundary conditions and demonstrates excellent convergence behavior and robustness. Validation against benchmark problems confirms its improved physical fidelity, particularly in regimes characterized by high ionic concentrations and strong electrochemical gradients. Simulation results reveal critical electrolyte phenomena, including electric double layer formation, rectification behavior, and the effects of solvation number, Debye length, and compressibility. The solver's modular variational formulation facilitates its extension to complex electrochemical systems involving multiple ionic species with asymmetric valences. We publicly provide the documented and validated solver framework."
2505.16573,"Stock price prediction is a critical area of financial forecasting, traditionally approached by training models using the historical price data of individual stocks. While these models effectively capture single-stock patterns, they fail to leverage potential correlations among stock trends, which could improve predictive performance. Current single-stock learning methods are thus limited in their ability to provide a broader understanding of price dynamics across multiple stocks. To address this, we propose a novel method that merges local patterns into a global understanding through cross-stock pattern integration. Our strategy is inspired by Federated Learning (FL), a paradigm designed for decentralized model training. FL enables collaborative learning across distributed datasets without sharing raw data, facilitating the aggregation of global insights while preserving data privacy. In our adaptation, we train models on individual stock data and iteratively merge them to create a unified global model. This global model is subsequently fine-tuned on specific stock data to retain local relevance. The proposed strategy enables parallel training of individual stock models, facilitating efficient utilization of computational resources and reducing overall training time. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method, demonstrating that it outperforms benchmark models and enhances the predictive capabilities of state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight the efficacy of Cross-Stock Trend Integration (CSTI) in advancing stock price prediction, offering a robust alternative to traditional single-stock learning methodologies."
2505.17459,"Predicting the behavior of complex systems is critical in many scientific and engineering domains, and hinges on the model's ability to capture their underlying dynamics. Existing methods encode the intrinsic dynamics of high-dimensional observations through latent representations and predict autoregressively. However, these latent representations lose the inherent spatial structure of spatiotemporal dynamics, leading to the predictor's inability to effectively model spatial interactions and neglect emerging dynamics during long-term prediction. In this work, we propose SparseDiff, introducing a test-time adaptation strategy to dynamically update the encoding scheme to accommodate emergent spatiotemporal structures during the long-term evolution of the system. Specifically, we first design a codebook-based sparse encoder, which coarsens the continuous spatial domain into a sparse graph topology. Then, we employ a graph neural ordinary differential equation to model the dynamics and guide a diffusion decoder for reconstruction. SparseDiff autoregressively predicts the spatiotemporal evolution and adjust the sparse topological structure to adapt to emergent spatiotemporal patterns by adaptive re-encoding. Extensive evaluations on representative systems demonstrate that SparseDiff achieves an average prediction error reduction of 49.99\% compared to baselines, requiring only 1\% of the spatial resolution."
2505.17524,"De novo peptide sequencing is a fundamental computational technique for ascertaining amino acid sequences of peptides directly from tandem mass spectrometry data, eliminating the need for reference databases. Cutting-edge models usually encode the observed mass spectra into latent representations from which peptides are predicted autoregressively. However, the issue of missing fragmentation, attributable to factors such as suboptimal fragmentation efficiency and instrumental constraints, presents a formidable challenge in practical applications. To tackle this obstacle, we propose a novel computational paradigm called \underline{\textbf{L}}atent \underline{\textbf{I}}mputation before \underline{\textbf{P}}rediction (LIPNovo). LIPNovo is devised to compensate for missing fragmentation information within observed spectra before executing the final peptide prediction. Rather than generating raw missing data, LIPNovo performs imputation in the latent space, guided by the theoretical peak profile of the target peptide sequence. The imputation process is conceptualized as a set-prediction problem, utilizing a set of learnable peak queries to reason about the relationships among observed peaks and directly generate the latent representations of theoretical peaks through optimal bipartite matching. In this way, LIPNovo manages to supplement missing information during inference and thus boosts performance. Despite its simplicity, experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that LIPNovo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins.

2505.17647,"This article presents a dataset used in the article ""Kinematics of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms"", published in the Journal of Biomechanics. The dataset is publicly available for download from the Zenodo data repository (this https URL). The dataset includes time-resolved 3D computed tomography angiography (4D-CTA) images of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) captured throughout the cardiac cycle from ten patients diagnosed with AAA, along with ten patient-specific AAA geometries extracted from these images. Typically, the 4D-CTA dataset for each patient contains ten electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated 3D-CTA image frames acquired over a cardiac cycle, capturing both the systolic and diastolic phases of the AAA configuration. For method verification, the dataset also includes synthetic ground truth data generated from Patient 1's 3D-CTA AAA image in the diastolic phase. The ground truth data includes the patient-specific finite element (FE) biomechanical model and a synthetic systolic 3D-CTA image. The synthetic systolic image was generated by warping Patient 1's diastolic 3D-CTA image using the realistic displacement field obtained from the AAA biomechanical FE model. The images were acquired at Fiona Stanley Hospital in Western Australia and provided to the researchers at the Intelligent Systems for Medicine Laboratory at The University of Western Australia (ISML-UWA), where image-based AAA kinematic analysis was performed. Our dataset enabled the analysis of AAA wall displacement and strain throughout the cardiac cycle using a non-invasive, in vivo, image registration-based approach. The use of widely adopted, open-source file formats (NRRD for images and STL for geometries) facilitates broad applicability and reusability in AAA biomechanics studies that require patient-specific geometry and information about AAA kinematics during cardiac cycle."
2505.18319,"The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate vision and language modalities has unlocked new potentials for scientific reasoning, outperforming prior benchmarks in both natural language and coding domains. Current materials science evaluation datasets such as MaScQA and SciQA remain largely text-based and fail to capture the visual and research-level analytic complexity required in materials discovery and design. We introduce MatVQA, a scalable benchmark specifically designed to address this gap. Generated via an automated pipeline, MArxivAgent, from recent materials literature, MatVQA features 1325 questions across four critical structure-property-performance (SPP) reasoning tasks. Uniquely, MatVQA employs an iterative process to eliminate textual shortcuts, compelling MLLMs to perform fine-grained, low-level visual analysis of material imagery (e.g., microscopy, diffraction patterns) integrated with multi-step scientific reasoning. Benchmarking 17 open- and closed-source MLLMs on MatVQA reveals substantial gaps in current multimodal reasoning capabilities.

2505.18408,"The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for new data infrastructure, as epidemiologists and public health workers raced to harness rapidly evolving data, analytics, and infrastructure in support of cross-sector investigations. To meet this need, we developed AERO, an automated research and data sharing platform for continuous, distributed, and multi-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we describe the AERO design and how it supports the automatic ingestion, validation, and transformation of monitored data into a form suitable for analysis; the automated execution of analyses on this data; and the sharing of data among different entities. We also describe how our AERO implementation leverages capabilities provided by the Globus platform and GitHub for automation, distributed execution, data sharing, and authentication. We present results obtained with an instance of AERO running two public health surveillance applications and demonstrate benchmarking results with a synthetic application, all of which are publicly available for testing."
2505.18621,"This position paper argues that next-generation non-equilibrium-inspired generative models will provide the essential foundation for better modeling real-world complex dynamical systems. While many classical generative algorithms draw inspiration from equilibrium physics, they are fundamentally limited in representing systems with transient, irreversible, or far-from-equilibrium behavior. We show that non-equilibrium frameworks naturally capture non-equilibrium processes and evolving distributions. Through empirical experiments on a dynamic Printz potential system, we demonstrate that non-equilibrium generative models better track temporal evolution and adapt to non-stationary landscapes. We further highlight future directions such as integrating non-equilibrium principles with generative AI to simulate rare events, inferring underlying mechanisms, and representing multi-scale dynamics across scientific domains. Our position is that embracing non-equilibrium physics is not merely beneficial--but necessary--for generative AI to serve as a scientific modeling tool, offering new capabilities for simulating, understanding, and controlling complex systems."

Accurate data on roofing materials is critical for modeling building vulnerability to natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and hurricanes, yet such data remain unavailable. To address this gap, we introduce RoofNet, the largest and most geographically diverse novel multimodal dataset to date, comprising over 51,500 samples from 184 geographically diverse sites pairing high-resolution Earth Observation (EO) imagery with curated text annotations for global roof material classification. RoofNet includes geographically diverse satellite imagery labeled with 14 key roofing types -- such as asphalt shingles, clay tiles, and metal sheets -- and is designed to enhance the fidelity of global exposure datasets through vision-language modeling (VLM). We sample EO tiles from climatically and architecturally distinct regions to construct a representative dataset. A subset of 6,000 images was annotated in collaboration with domain experts to fine-tune a VLM. We used geographic- and material-aware prompt tuning to enhance class separability. The fine-tuned model was then applied to the remaining EO tiles, with predictions refined through rule-based and human-in-the-loop verification. In addition to material labels, RoofNet provides rich metadata including roof shape, footprint area, solar panel presence, and indicators of mixed roofing materials (e.g., HVAC systems). RoofNet supports scalable, AI-driven risk assessment and serves as a downstream benchmark for evaluating model generalization across regions -- offering actionable insights for insurance underwriting, disaster preparedness, and infrastructure policy planning."
2505.19566,"We present a novel formulation for modeling phase-field fracture propagation based on the Integrated Finite Element Neural Network (IFENN) framework. IFENN is a hybrid solver scheme that utilizes neural networks as PDE solvers within FEM, preserving accuracy via residual minimization while achieving speed-up via swift network predictions and reduction of the size of system of equations in coupled problems. In this work, we introduce a radically new formulation of IFENN in which the phase-field variable is calculated using physics-informed convolutional networks (PICNNs), while the equilibrium equation is still solved using FEM to maintain the solver robustness. Unlike conventional approaches, which rely on sequence or time-dependent models, we eliminate the need to include temporal features in the training setup and inference stage. Instead, we show that it is sufficient to learn only the spatial coupling between the strain energy density and the phase-field variable in the vicinity of the fracture process zone, and utilize this information along the advancing crack simulation. We train a single CNN in a purely physics-based, unsupervised manner on just two load increments from a single-notch tension problem, with a total training time of only 5 minutes. Following this exceptionally minimal and fast training, we show that the same PICNN can (when embedded within IFENN) model crack propagation in a very wide range of unseen scenarios, including arbitrarily rectangular domains, single and multiple interacting cracks, varying mesh densities, and arbitrary loading paths. The proposed formulation delivers breakthroughs that address many of the limitations in the existing literature of hybrid modeling, introducing a new paradigm for the development of generalizable, physics-consistent hybrid models that are applicable to fracture and other coupled problems."
2505.19819,"Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) methods show great potential for scaling pre-trained general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to hundreds or thousands of use scenarios. However, their efficacy in high-stakes domains like finance is rarely explored, e.g., passing CFA exams and analyzing SEC filings. In this paper, we present the open-source FinLoRA project that benchmarks LoRA methods on both general and highly professional financial tasks. First, we curated 19 datasets covering diverse financial applications; in particular, we created four novel XBRL analysis datasets based on 150 SEC filings. Second, we evaluated five LoRA methods and five base LLMs. Finally, we provide extensive experimental results in terms of accuracy, F1, and BERTScore and report computational cost in terms of time and GPU memory during fine-tuning and inference stages. We find that LoRA methods achieved substantial performance gains of 36\% on average over base models. Our FinLoRA project provides an affordable and scalable approach to democratize financial intelligence to the general public.

2505.20685,"Bayesian optimization (BO) struggles in high dimensions, where Gaussian-process surrogates demand heavy retraining and brittle assumptions, slowing progress on real engineering and design problems. We introduce GIT-BO, a Gradient-Informed BO framework that couples TabPFN v2, a tabular foundation model that performs zero-shot Bayesian inference in context, with an active-subspace mechanism computed from the model's own predictive-mean gradients. This aligns exploration to an intrinsic low-dimensional subspace via a Fisher-information estimate and selects queries with a UCB acquisition, requiring no online retraining. Across 60 problem variants spanning 20 benchmarks-nine scalable synthetic families and ten real-world tasks (e.g., power systems, Rover, MOPTA08, Mazda)-up to 500 dimensions, GIT-BO delivers a stronger performance-time trade-off than state-of-the-art GP-based methods (SAASBO, TuRBO, Vanilla BO, BAxUS), ranking highest in performance and with runtime advantages that grow with dimensionality. Limitations include memory footprint and dependence on the capacity of the underlying TFM."
2505.20911,"The use of reduced and mixed precision computing has gained increasing attention in high-performance computing (HPC) as a means to improve computational efficiency, particularly on modern hardware architectures like GPUs. In this work, we explore the application of mixed precision arithmetic in compressible turbulent flow simulations using explicit finite difference schemes. We extend the OPS and OpenSBLI frameworks to support customizable precision levels, enabling fine-grained control over precision allocation for different computational tasks. Through a series of numerical experiments on the Taylor-Green vortex benchmark, we demonstrate that mixed precision strategies, such as half-single and single-double combinations, can offer significant performance gains without compromising numerical accuracy. However, pure half-precision computations result in unacceptable accuracy loss, underscoring the need for careful precision selection. Our results show that mixed precision configurations can reduce memory usage and communication overhead, leading to notable speedups, particularly on multi-CPU and multi-GPU systems."
2505.20942,"The use of boundary integral equations in modeling boundary value problems-such as elastic, acoustic, or electromagnetic ones-is well established in the literature and widespread in practical applications. These equations are typically solved numerically using boundary element methods (BEMs), which generally provide accurate and reliable solutions. When the frequency of the wave phenomenon under study increases, the discretization of the problem is typically chosen to maintain a fixed number of unknowns per wavelength. Under these conditions, the BEM over finite-dimensional subspaces of piecewise polynomial basis functions is commonly believed to provide a bounded solution accuracy. If proven, this would constitute a significant advantage of the BEM with respect to finite element and finite difference time domain methods, which, in contrast, are affected by numerical pollution. In this work, we conduct a rigorous spectral analysis of some of the most commonly used boundary integral operators and examine the impact of the BEM discretization on the solution accuracy of widely used integral equations modeling two-dimensional electromagnetic scattering from a perfectly electrically conducting cylinder. We consider both ill-conditioned and well-conditioned equations, the latter being characterized by solution operators bounded independently of frequency. Our analysis, which is capable of tracking the effects of BEM discretization on compositions and sums of different operators, reveals a form of pollution that affects, in different measures, equations of both kinds. After elucidating the mechanism by which the BEM discretization impacts accuracy, we propose a solution strategy that can cure the pollution problem thus evidenced. The defining strength of the proposed theoretical model lies in its capacity to deliver deep insight into the root causes of the phenomenon."
2505.21349,"How can a traffic simulation be designed to faithfully reflect real-world traffic conditions? One crucial step is modeling the volume of traffic demand. But past demand modeling approaches have relied on unrealistic or suboptimal heuristics, and they have failed to adequately account for the effects of noisy and multimodal data on simulation outcomes. In this work, we integrate advances in AI to construct a three-step, end-to-end pipeline for systematically modeling traffic demand from detector data: computer vision for vehicle counting from noisy camera footage, combinatorial optimization for vehicle route generation from multimodal data, and large language models for iterative simulation refinement from natural language feedback. Using a road network from Strongsville, Ohio as a testbed, we show that our pipeline accurately captures the city's traffic patterns in a granular simulation. Beyond Strongsville, incorporating noise and multimodality makes our framework generalizable to municipalities with different levels of data and infrastructure availability."
2505.21688,"We study the statistical properties of passive tracer transport in turbulent flows with a mean gradient, emphasizing tracer intermittency and extreme events. An analytically tractable model is developed, coupling zonal and shear velocity components with both linear and nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Formulating the model in Fourier space, a simple explicit solution for the tracer invariant statistics is derived. Through this model we identify the resonance condition responsible for non-Gaussian behavior and bursts in the tracer. Resonant conditions, that lead to a peak in the tracer variance, occur when the zonal flow and the shear flow phase speeds are equivalent. Numerical experiments across a range of regimes, including different energy spectra and zonal flow models, are performed to validate these findings and demonstrate how the velocity field and stochasticity determines tracer extremes. These results provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying turbulent tracer transport, with implications for uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in geophysical and environmental applications."
2505.2267,"Building Information Modeling (BIM) has revolutionized the construction industry by providing a comprehensive digital representation of building structures throughout their lifecycle. However, existing research lacks effective methods for capturing the complex spatial and topological relationships between components in BIM models, which are essential for understanding design patterns and enhancing decision-making. This study proposes a unified network-based representation method that integrates the ""semantic-spatial-topological"" multi-dimensional design features of BIM models. By extending the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) standard, we introduce local spatial relationships and topological connections between components to enrich the network structure. This representation method enables a more detailed understanding of component interactions, dependencies, and implicit design patterns, effectively capturing the semantic, topological, and spatial relationships in BIM, and holds significant potential for the representation and learning of design patterns."
2505.22761,"Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been emerging as a powerful computational tool for solving differential equations. However, the applicability of these models is still in its initial stages and requires more standardization to gain wider popularity. Through this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of PINNs approaches exploring various aspects related to their architecture, variants, areas of application, real-world use cases, challenges, and so on. Even though existing surveys can be identified, they fail to provide a comprehensive view as they primarily focus on either different application scenarios or limit their study to a superficial level. This survey attempts to bridge the gap in the existing literature by presenting a detailed analysis of all these factors combined with recent advancements and state-of-the-art research in PINNs. Additionally, we discuss prevalent challenges in PINNs implementation and present some of the future research directions as well. The overall contributions of the survey can be summarised into three sections: A detailed overview of PINNs architecture and variants, a performance analysis of PINNs on different equations and application domains highlighting their features. Finally, we present a detailed discussion of current issues and future research directions."
2505.24337,"Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are decentralized exchange protocols that provide continuous access to token liquidity without the need for order books or traditional market makers. However, this innovation has failed to scale when it comes to cross-chain swaps. Modern cross-chain swaps employ double-sided AMMs, which are not only inefficient due to liquidity fragmentation but also require an intermediate token. This introduces inherent volatility risk as well as blockchain and bridging risk, especially in the case of wrapped tokens. This paper describes the inefficiencies of existing AMM invariants, particularly their mixed polynomial nature, and derives a new class of AMMs that do not have bi-state dependency between the assets being swapped. We propose a novel method of value transfer swaps using the described invariant that mitigates the need for bi-state dependency and eliminates the need for intermediate tokens or bridging. Furthermore, we show how this mechanism enables efficient cross-chain swaps with lower gas requirements and no bridging risks. The proposed technology is designed to support cross-chain swaps across any permutation of L1, L2, and L3 blockchains."
2505.2465,"Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a spectrum of tasks in financial services, including report generation, chatbots, sentiment analysis, regulatory compliance, investment advisory, financial knowledge retrieval, and summarization. However, their intrinsic complexity and lack of transparency pose significant challenges, especially in the highly regulated financial sector, where interpretability, fairness, and accountability are critical. As far as we are aware, this paper presents the first application in the finance domain of understanding and utilizing the inner workings of LLMs through mechanistic interpretability, addressing the pressing need for transparency and control in AI systems. Mechanistic interpretability is the most intuitive and transparent way to understand LLM behavior by reverse-engineering their internal workings. By dissecting the activations and circuits within these models, it provides insights into how specific features or components influence predictions - making it possible not only to observe but also to modify model behavior. In this paper, we explore the theoretical aspects of mechanistic interpretability and demonstrate its practical relevance through a range of financial use cases and experiments, including applications in trading strategies, sentiment analysis, bias, and hallucination detection. While not yet widely adopted, mechanistic interpretability is expected to become increasingly vital as adoption of LLMs increases. Advanced interpretability tools can ensure AI systems remain ethical, transparent, and aligned with evolving financial regulations. In this paper, we have put special emphasis on how these techniques can help unlock interpretability requirements for regulatory and compliance purposes - addressing both current needs and anticipating future expectations from financial regulators globally."
2505.24708,"High-dimensional Bayesian inverse analysis (dim >> 100) is mostly unfeasible for computationally demanding, nonlinear physics-based high-fidelity (HF) models. Usually, the use of more efficient gradient-based inference schemes is impeded if the multi-physics models are provided by complex legacy codes. Adjoint-based derivatives are either exceedingly cumbersome to derive or non-existent for practically relevant large-scale nonlinear and coupled multi-physics problems. Similarly, holistic automated differentiation w.r.t. primary variables of multi-physics codes is usually not yet an option and requires extensive code restructuring if not considered from the outset in the software design. This absence of differentiability further exacerbates the already present computational challenges. To overcome the existing limitations, we propose a novel inference approach called Bayesian multi-fidelity inverse analysis (BMFIA), which leverages simpler and computationally cheaper lower-fidelity (LF) models that are designed to provide model derivatives. BMFIA learns a simple, probabilistic dependence of the LF and HF models, which is then employed in an altered likelihood formulation to statistically correct the inaccurate LF response. From a Bayesian viewpoint, this dependence represents a multi-fidelity conditional density (discriminative model). We demonstrate how this multi-fidelity conditional density can be learned robustly in the small data regime from only a few HF and LF simulations (50 to 300), which would not be sufficient for naive surrogate approaches. The formulation is fully differentiable and allows the flexible design of a wide range of LF models."
2506.01101,"We consider the problems of estimation and optimization of two popular convex risk measures: utility-based shortfall risk (UBSR) and Optimized Certainty Equivalent (OCE) risk. We extend these risk measures to cover possibly unbounded random variables. We cover prominent risk measures like the entropic risk, expectile risk, monotone mean-variance risk, Value-at-Risk, and Conditional Value-at-Risk as few special cases of either the UBSR or the OCE risk. In the context of estimation, we derive non-asymptotic bounds on the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean-squared error (MSE) of the classical sample average approximation (SAA) estimators of both, the UBSR and the OCE. Next, in the context of optimization, we derive expressions for the UBSR gradient and the OCE gradient under a smooth parameterization. Utilizing these expressions, we propose gradient estimators for both, the UBSR and the OCE. We use the SAA estimator of UBSR in both these gradient estimators, and derive non-asymptotic bounds on MAE and MSE for the proposed gradient estimation schemes. We incorporate the aforementioned gradient estimators into a stochastic gradient (SG) algorithm for optimization. Finally, we derive non-asymptotic bounds that quantify the rate of convergence of our SG algorithm for the optimization of the UBSR and the OCE risk measure."
2506.0112,"Finding the Lie-algebraic closure of a handful of matrices has important applications in quantum computing and quantum control. For most realistic cases, the closure cannot be determined analytically, necessitating an explicit numerical construction. The standard construction algorithm makes repeated calls to a subroutine that determines whether a matrix is linearly independent from a potentially large set of matrices. Because the common implementation of this subroutine has a high complexity, the construction of Lie closure is practically limited to trivially small matrix sizes. We present efficient alternative methods of linear independence check that simultaneously reduce the computational complexity and memory footprint. An implementation of one of the methods is validated against known results. Our new algorithms enable numerical studies of Lie closure in larger system sizes than was previously possible."
2506.01973,"Financial Large Language Models (FinLLMs), such as open FinGPT and proprietary BloombergGPT, have demonstrated great potential in select areas of financial services. Beyond this earlier language-centric approach, Multimodal Financial Foundation Models (MFFMs) can digest interleaved multimodal financial data, including fundamental data, market data, data analytics, macroeconomic, and alternative data (e.g., natural language, audio, images, and video). In this position paper, presented at the MFFM Workshop joined with ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF) 2024, we describe the progress, prospects, and challenges of MFFMs. This paper also highlights ongoing research on FinAgents in the \textbf{SecureFinAI Lab}\footnote{\this https URL} at Columbia University.

2506.02129,"Machine learning has revolutionized polymer science by enabling rapid property prediction and generative design. Large language models (LLMs) offer further opportunities in polymer informatics by simplifying workflows that traditionally rely on large labeled datasets, handcrafted representations, and complex feature engineering. LLMs leverage natural language inputs through transfer learning, eliminating the need for explicit fingerprinting and streamlining training. In this study, we finetune general purpose LLMs -- open-source LLaMA-3-8B and commercial GPT-3.5 -- on a curated dataset of 11,740 entries to predict key thermal properties: glass transition, melting, and decomposition temperatures. Using parameter-efficient fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization, we benchmark these models against traditional fingerprinting-based approaches -- Polymer Genome, polyGNN, and polyBERT -- under single-task (ST) and multi-task (MT) learning. We find that while LLM-based methods approach traditional models in performance, they generally underperform in predictive accuracy and efficiency. LLaMA-3 consistently outperforms GPT-3.5, likely due to its tunable open-source architecture. Additionally, ST learning proves more effective than MT, as LLMs struggle to capture cross-property correlations, a key strength of traditional methods. Analysis of molecular embeddings reveals limitations of general purpose LLMs in representing nuanced chemo-structural information compared to handcrafted features and domain-specific embeddings. These findings provide insight into the interplay between molecular embeddings and natural language processing, guiding LLM selection for polymer informatics."
2506.02282,"web3 wallets are key to managing user identity on blockchain. The main purpose of a web3 wallet application is to manage the private key for the user and provide an interface to interact with the blockchain. The key management scheme ( KMS ) used by the wallet to store and recover the private key can be either custodial, where the keys are permissioned and in custody of the wallet provider or noncustodial where the keys are in custody of the user. The existing non-custodial key management schemes tend to offset the burden of storing and recovering the key entirely on the user by asking them to remember seed-phrases. This creates onboarding hassles for the user and introduces the risk that the user may lose their assets if they forget or lose their seedphrase/private key. In this paper, we propose a novel method of backing up user keys using a non-custodial key management technique that allows users to save and recover a backup of their private key using any independent sign-in method such as google-oAuth or other 3P oAuth."
2506.02538,"There is growing interest in conducting small-scale tests to gain additional insight into the fracture behaviour of components across a wide range of materials. For example, micro-scale mechanical tests inside of a microscope (\emph{in situ}) enable direct, high-resolution observation of the interplay between crack growth and microstructural phenomena (e.g., dislocation behaviour or the fracture resistance of a particular interface), and sub-size samples are increasingly used when only a limited amount of material is available. However, to obtain quantitative insight and extract relevant fracture parameters, the sample must be sufficiently large for a $J$- (HRR) or a $K$-field to exist. We conduct numerical and semi-analytical studies to map the conditions (sample geometry, material) that result in a valid, quantitative fracture experiment. Specifically, for a wide range of material properties, crack lengths and sample dimensions, we establish the maximum value of the $J$-integral where an HRR field ceases to exist (i.e., the maximum $J$ value at which fracture must occur for the test to be valid, $J_\mathrm{max}$). Maps are generated to establish the maximum valid $J$ value ($J_\mathrm{max}$) as a function of yield strength, strain hardening and minimum sample size. These maps are then used to discuss the existing experimental literature and provide guidance on how to conduct quantitative experiments. Finally, our study is particularised to the analysis of metals that have been embrittled due to hydrogen exposure. The response of relevant materials under hydrogen-containing environments are superimposed on the aforementioned maps, determining the conditions that will enable quantitative insight."
2506.02744,"Spatial representations that capture both structural and semantic characteristics of urban environments are essential for urban modeling. Traditional spatial embeddings often prioritize spatial proximity while underutilizing fine-grained contextual information from places. To address this limitation, we introduce CaLLiPer+, an extension of the CaLLiPer model that systematically integrates Point-of-Interest (POI) names alongside categorical labels within a multimodal contrastive learning framework. We evaluate its effectiveness on two downstream tasks, land use classification and socioeconomic status distribution mapping, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 4% to 11% over baseline methods. Additionally, we show that incorporating POI names enhances location retrieval, enabling models to capture complex urban concepts with greater precision. Ablation studies further reveal the complementary role of POI names and the advantages of leveraging pretrained text encoders for spatial representations. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of integrating fine-grained semantic attributes and multimodal learning techniques to advance the development of urban foundation models."
2506.03329,"The optimization of functional materials is important to enhance their properties, but their complex geometries pose great challenges to optimization. Data-driven algorithms efficiently navigate such complex design spaces by learning relationships between material structures and performance metrics to discover high-performance functional materials. Surrogate-based active learning, continually improving its surrogate model by iteratively including high-quality data points, has emerged as a cost-effective data-driven approach. Furthermore, it can be coupled with quantum computing to enhance optimization processes, especially when paired with a special form of surrogate model ($i.e.$, quadratic unconstrained binary optimization), formulated by factorization machine. However, current practices often overlook the variability in design space sizes when determining the initial data size for optimization. In this work, we investigate the optimal initial data sizes required for efficient convergence across various design space sizes. By employing averaged piecewise linear regression, we identify initiation points where convergence begins, highlighting the crucial role of employing adequate initial data in achieving efficient optimization. These results contribute to the efficient optimization of functional materials by ensuring faster convergence and reducing computational costs in surrogate-based active learning."
2506.04027,"Partitioned methods for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) involve solving the structural and flow problems sequentially. These methods allow for separate settings for the fluid and solid subsystems and thus modularity, enabling reuse of advanced commercial and open-source software. Most partitioned FSI schemes apply a Dirichlet-Neumann (DN) split of the interface conditions. The DN scheme is adequate in a wide range of applications, but it is sensitive to the added-mass effect, and it is susceptible to the incompressibility dilemma, i.e. it completely fails for FSI problems with an incompressible fluid furnished with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the part of its boundary complementary to the interface. In this paper, we show that if the fluid is incompressible and the fluid domain is nearly-closed, i.e. it carries Dirichlet conditions except for a permeable part of the boundary carrying a Robin condition, then the DN partitioned approach is sensitive to the flow resistance at the permeable part, and convergence of the partitioned approach deteriorates as the flow resistance increases. The DN scheme then becomes unstable in the limit as the flow resistance passes to infinity. Based on a simple model problem, we show that in the nearly-closed case, the convergence rate of the DN partitioned method depends on a so-called added-damping effect. The analysis gives insights that can aid to improve robustness and efficiency of partitioned method for FSI problems with contact, e.g. valve applications. In addition, the results elucidate the incompressibility dilemma as a limit of the added-damping effect passing to infinity, and the corresponding challenges related to FSI problems with nearly closed fluid-domain configurations. Via numerical experiments, we consider the generalization of the results of the simple model problem to more complex nearly-closed FSI problems."
2506.04249,"Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a range of configurations in memory capacity tasks."

2506.0496,"This paper presents a Finite Element Model Updating framework for identifying heterogeneous material distributions in planar Bernoulli-Euler beams based on a rotation-free isogeometric formulation. The procedure follows two steps: First, the elastic properties are identified from quasi-static displacements; then, the density is determined from modal data (low frequencies and mode shapes), given the previously obtained elastic properties. The identification relies on three independent discretizations: the isogeometric finite element mesh, a high-resolution grid of experimental measurements, and a material mesh composed of low-order Lagrange elements. The material mesh approximates the unknown material distributions, with its nodal values serving as design variables. The error between experiments and numerical model is expressed in a least squares manner. The objective is minimized using local optimization with the trust-region method, providing analytical derivatives to accelerate computations. Several numerical examples exhibiting large displacements are provided to test the proposed approach. To alleviate membrane locking, the B2M1 discretization is employed when necessary. Quasi-experimental data is generated using refined finite element models with random noise applied up to 4%. The method yields satisfactory results as long as a sufficient amount of experimental data is available, even for high measurement noise. Regularization is used to ensure a stable solution for dense material meshes. The density can be accurately reconstructed based on the previously identified elastic properties. The proposed framework can be straightforwardly extended to shells and 3D continua."
2506.05019,"Pure time series forecasting tasks typically focus exclusively on numerical features; however, real-world financial decision-making demands the comparison and analysis of heterogeneous sources of information. Recent advances in deep learning and large scale language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in capturing sentiment and other qualitative signals, thereby enhancing the accuracy of financial time series predictions. Despite these advances, most existing datasets consist solely of price series and news text, are confined to a single market, and remain limited in scale. In this paper, we introduce FinMultiTime, the first large scale, multimodal financial time series dataset. FinMultiTime temporally aligns four distinct modalities financial news, structured financial tables, K-line technical charts, and stock price time series across both the S&P 500 and HS 300 universes. Covering 5,105 stocks from 2009 to 2025 in the United States and China, the dataset totals 112.6 GB and provides minute-level, daily, and quarterly resolutions, thus capturing short, medium, and long term market signals with high fidelity. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) scale and data quality markedly boost prediction accuracy; (2) multimodal fusion yields moderate gains in Transformer models; and (3) a fully reproducible pipeline enables seamless dataset updates."

2506.06356,"This paper presents a sophisticated multi-day turnover quantitative trading algorithm that integrates advanced deep learning techniques with comprehensive cross-sectional stock prediction for the Chinese A-share market. Our framework combines five interconnected modules: initial stock selection through deep cross-sectional prediction networks, opening signal distribution analysis using mixture models for arbitrage identification, market capitalization and liquidity-based dynamic position sizing, grid-search optimized profit-taking and stop-loss mechanisms, and multi-granularity volatility-based market timing models. The algorithm employs a novel approach to balance capital efficiency with risk management through adaptive holding periods and sophisticated entry/exit timing. Trained on comprehensive A-share data from 2010-2020 and rigorously backtested on 2021-2024 data, our method achieves remarkable performance with 15.2\% annualized returns, maximum drawdown constrained below 5\%, and a Sharpe ratio of 1.87. The strategy demonstrates exceptional scalability by maintaining 50-100 daily positions with a 9-day maximum holding period, incorporating dynamic profit-taking and stop-loss mechanisms that enhance capital turnover efficiency while preserving risk-adjusted returns. Our approach exhibits robust performance across various market regimes while maintaining high capital capacity suitable for institutional deployment."
2506.06622,"Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense promise for revolutionizing financial analysis and decision-making, yet their direct application is often hampered by issues of data hallucination and lack of access to real-time, verifiable financial information. This paper introduces QuantMCP, a novel framework designed to rigorously ground LLMs in financial reality. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized and secure tool invocation, QuantMCP enables LLMs to accurately interface with a diverse array of Python-accessible financial data APIs (e.g., Wind, yfinance).

More critically, once furnished with this verified, structured data, the LLM's analytical capabilities are unlocked, empowering it to perform sophisticated data interpretation, generate insights, and ultimately support more informed financial decision-making processes. QuantMCP provides a robust, extensible, and secure bridge between conversational AI and the complex world of financial data, aiming to enhance both the reliability and the analytical depth of LLM applications in finance."
2506.08563,"Differential equations are involved in modeling many engineering problems. Many efforts have been devoted to solving differential equations. Due to the flexibility of neural networks, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently been proposed to solve complex differential equations and have demonstrated superior performance in many applications. While the L2 loss function is usually a default choice in PINNs, it has been shown that the corresponding numerical solution is incorrect and unstable for some complex equations. In this work, we propose a new PINNs framework named Kernel Packet accelerated PINNs (KP-PINNs), which gives a new expression of the loss function using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm and uses the Kernel Packet (KP) method to accelerate the computation. Theoretical results show that KP-PINNs can be stable across various differential equations. Numerical experiments illustrate that KP-PINNs can solve differential equations effectively and efficiently. This framework provides a promising direction for improving the stability and accuracy of PINNs-based solvers in scientific computing."

Identifying optimal pacing sites remains challenging, largely due to patient-specific anatomical variability and the limitations of current individualized planning strategies. In a step towards constructing an in-silico approach to help address this issue, we develop two geometric deep learning (DL) models, based on graph neural network (GNN) and geometry-informed neural operator (GINO), to predict cardiac activation time map in real-time for CRT planning and optimization. Both models are trained on a large synthetic dataset generated from finite-element (FE) simulations over a wide range of left ventricular (LV) geometries, pacing site configurations, and tissue conductivities. The GINO model significantly outperforms the GNN model, with lower prediction errors (1.14% vs 3.14%) and superior robustness to noise and various mesh discretization. Using the GINO model, we also develop a workflow for optimizing the pacing site in CRT from given activation time map and LV geometry. Compared to randomly selecting a pacing site, the CRT optimization workflow produces a larger reduction in maximum activation time (20% vs. 8%). In conjunction with an interactive web-based graphical user interface (GUI) available atthis https URL, the GINO model shows promising potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized pre-procedural CRT optimization."
2506.09234,"Automatic transaction categorization is crucial for enhancing the customer experience in QuickBooks by providing accurate accounting and bookkeeping. The distinct challenges in this domain stem from the unique formatting of transaction descriptions, the wide variety of transaction categories, and the vast scale of the data involved. Furthermore, organizing transaction data in a relational database creates difficulties in developing a unified model that covers the entire database. In this work, we develop a novel graph-based model, named Rel-Cat, which is built directly over the relational database. We introduce a new formulation of transaction categorization as a link prediction task within this graph structure. By integrating techniques from natural language processing and graph machine learning, our model not only outperforms the existing production model in QuickBooks but also scales effectively to a growing customer base with a simpler, more effective architecture without compromising on accuracy. This design also helps tackle a key challenge of the cold start problem by adapting to minimal data."
2506.09749,"In complex engineering systems, the dependencies among components or development activities are often modeled and analyzed using Design Structure Matrix (DSM). Reorganizing elements within a DSM to minimize feedback loops and enhance modularity or process efficiency constitutes a challenging combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in engineering design and operations. As problem sizes increase and dependency networks become more intricate, traditional optimization methods that rely solely on mathematical heuristics often fail to capture the contextual nuances and struggle to deliver effective solutions. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address such CO problems by leveraging their capabilities for advanced reasoning and contextual understanding. We propose a novel LLM-based framework that integrates network topology with contextual domain knowledge for iterative optimization of DSM sequencing-a common CO problem. Experiments on various DSM cases demonstrate that our method consistently achieves faster convergence and superior solution quality compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines. Notably, incorporating contextual domain knowledge significantly enhances optimization performance regardless of the chosen LLM backbone. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to solve complex engineering CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical reasoning. This approach paves the way towards a new paradigm in LLM-based engineering design optimization."
2506.09755,"Research and practice in Intelligent Design (ID) have significantly enhanced engineering innovation, efficiency, quality, and productivity over recent decades, fundamentally reshaping how engineering designers think, behave, and interact with design processes. The recent emergence of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has demonstrated general knowledge-based reasoning capabilities, and open new avenues for further transformation in engineering design. In this context, this paper introduces Intelligent Design 4.0 (ID 4.0) as an emerging paradigm empowered by foundation model-based agentic AI systems. We review the historical evolution of ID across four distinct stages: rule-based expert systems, task-specific machine learning models, large-scale foundation AI models, and the recent emerging paradigm of foundation model-based multi-agent collaboration. We propose an ontological framework for ID 4.0 and discuss its potential to support end-to-end automation of engineering design processes through coordinated, autonomous multi-agent-based systems. Furthermore, we discuss challenges and opportunities of ID 4.0, including perspectives on data foundations, agent collaboration mechanisms, and the formulation of design problems and objectives. In sum, these insights provide a foundation for advancing Intelligent Design toward greater adaptivity, autonomy, and effectiveness in addressing the growing complexity of engineering design."
2506.09822,"In this short note, we report and analyze a striking event: OpenAI's large language model o3 has outwitted all students in a university exam on thermodynamics. The thermodynamics exam is a difficult hurdle for most students, where they must show that they have mastered the fundamentals of this important topic. Consequently, the failure rates are very high, A-grades are rare - and they are considered proof of the students' exceptional intellectual abilities. This is because pattern learning does not help in the exam. The problems can only be solved by knowledgeably and creatively combining principles of thermodynamics. We have given our latest thermodynamics exam not only to the students but also to OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model, o3, and have assessed the answers of o3 exactly the same way as those of the students. In zero-shot mode, the model o3 solved all problems correctly, better than all students who took the exam; its overall score was in the range of the best scores we have seen in more than 10,000 similar exams since 1985. This is a turning point: machines now excel in complex tasks, usually taken as proof of human intellectual capabilities. We discuss the consequences this has for the work of engineers and the education of future engineers."
2506.1017,"Action observation (AO) therapy is a promising rehabilitative treatment for motor and language function in individuals recovering from neurological conditions, such as stroke. This pilot study aimed to investigate the potential of humanoid robots to support AO therapy in rehabilitation settings. The brain activity of three healthy right-handed participants was monitored with electroencephalography (EEG) while they observed eight different actions performed by two agents, a human actor and a robot, using their left and right arms. Their event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs, changes in the spectral power of neural oscillations in response to an event or stimulus, compared to baseline) in sensorimotor regions were analyzed. The single-subject analysis showed variability in ERSP patterns among all participants, including power suppression in sensorimotor mu and beta rhythms. One participant showed stronger responses to ""robot"" AO conditions than to ""human"" conditions. Strong and positive correlations in ERSP across all conditions were observed for almost all participants and channels, implying common cognitive processes or neural networks at play in the mirror neuron system during AO. The results support the feasibility of using EEG to explore differences in neural responses to observation of robot- and human-induced actions."
2506.10224,"This paper develops an interpretable, non-intrusive reduced-order modeling technique using regularized kernel interpolation. Existing non-intrusive approaches approximate the dynamics of a reduced-order model (ROM) by solving a data-driven least-squares regression problem for low-dimensional matrix operators. Our approach instead leverages regularized kernel interpolation, which yields an optimal approximation of the ROM dynamics from a user-defined reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We show that our kernel-based approach can produce interpretable ROMs whose structure mirrors full-order model structure by embedding judiciously chosen feature maps into the kernel. The approach is flexible and allows a combination of informed structure through feature maps and closure terms via more general nonlinear terms in the kernel. We also derive a computable a posteriori error bound that combines standard error estimates for intrusive projection-based ROMs and kernel interpolants. The approach is demonstrated in several numerical experiments that include comparisons to operator inference using both proper orthogonal decomposition and quadratic manifold dimension reduction."
2506.10711,"Generating accurate and stable long rollouts is a notorious challenge for time-dependent PDEs (Partial Differential Equations). Recently, motivated by the importance of high-frequency accuracy, a refiner model called PDERefiner utilizes diffusion models to refine outputs for every time step, since the denoising process could increase the correctness of modeling high frequency part. For 1-D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, refiner models can degrade the amplitude of high frequency part better than not doing refinement process. However, for some other cases, the spectrum might be more complicated. For example, for a harder PDE like Navior-Stokes equation, diffusion models could over-degrade the higher frequency part. This motivates us to release the constraint that each frequency weighs the same. We enhance our refiner model with doing adjustments on spectral space, which recovers Blurring diffusion models. We developed a new v-prediction technique for Blurring diffusion models, recovering the MSE training objective on the first refinement step. We show that in this case, for different model backbones, such as U-Net and neural operators, the outputs of PDE-SpectralRefiner are more accurate for both one-step MSE loss and rollout loss."
2506.1088,"When modeling propagation and scattering phenomena using integral equations discretized by the boundary element method, it is common practice to approximate the boundary of the scatterer with a mesh comprising elements of size approximately equal to a fraction of the wavelength $\lambda$ of the incident wave, e.g., $\lambda/10$. In this work, by analyzing the spectra of the operator matrices, we show a discrepancy with respect to the continuous operators which grows with the simulation frequency, challenging the common belief that the aforementioned widely used discretization approach is sufficient to maintain the accuracy of the solution constant when increasing the frequency."
2506.11395,"Studying physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling partial differential equations to solve the acoustic wave field has produced promising results for simple geometries in two-dimensional domains. One option is to compute the time-harmonic wave field using the Helmholtz equation. Compared to existing numerical models, the physics-informed neural networks forward problem has to overcome several topics related to the convergence of the optimization toward the ""true"" solution. The topics reach from considering the physical dimensionality (from 2D to 3D), the modeling of realistic sources (from a self-similar source to a realistic confined point source), the modeling of sound-hard (Neumann) boundary conditions, and the modeling of the full wave field by considering the complex solution quantities. Within this contribution, we study 3D room acoustic cases at low frequency, varying the source definition and the number of boundary condition sets and using a complex speed of sound model to account for some degree of absorption. We assess the convergence behavior by looking at the loss landscape of the PINN architecture, the $L^2$ error compared to a finite element reference simulation for each network architecture and configuration. The convergence studies showed that at least six training points per wavelength are necessary for accurate training and subsequent predictions of the PINN. The developments are part of an initiative aiming to model the low-frequency behavior of room acoustics, including absorbers."
2506.1183,"The construction of large-scale, high-quality datasets is a fundamental prerequisite for developing robust and generalizable foundation models in motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG signals collected from different subjects and devices are often plagued by low signal-to-noise ratio, heterogeneity in electrode configurations, and substantial inter-subject variability, posing significant challenges for effective model training. In this paper, we propose CLEAN-MI, a scalable and systematic data construction pipeline for constructing large-scale, efficient, and accurate neurodata in the MI paradigm. CLEAN-MI integrates frequency band filtering, channel template selection, subject screening, and marginal distribution alignment to systematically filter out irrelevant or low-quality data and standardize multi-source EEG datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLEAN-MI on multiple public MI datasets, achieving consistent improvements in data quality and classification performance."
2506.1225,"Classification of ceramic thin sections is fundamental for understanding ancient pottery production techniques, provenance, and trade networks. Although effective, traditional petrographic analysis is time-consuming. This study explores the application of deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), as complementary tools to support the classification of Levantine ceramics based on their petrographic fabrics. A dataset of 1,424 thin section images from 178 ceramic samples belonging to several archaeological sites across the Levantine area, mostly from the Bronze Age, with few samples dating to the Iron Age, was used to train and evaluate these models. The results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly improves classification performance, with a ResNet18 model achieving 92.11% accuracy and a ViT reaching 88.34%. Explainability techniques, including Guided Grad-CAM and attention maps, were applied to interpret and visualize the models' decisions, revealing that both CNNs and ViTs successfully focus on key mineralogical features for the classification of the samples into their respective petrographic fabrics. These findings highlight the potential of explainable AI in archaeometric studies, providing a reproducible and efficient methodology for ceramic analysis while maintaining transparency in model decision-making."
2506.13226,"The Newmark/Newton-Raphson (NNR) method is widely employed for solving nonlinear dynamic systems. However, the current NNR method exhibits limited applicability in complex nonlinear dynamic systems, as the acquisition of the Jacobian matrix required for Newton iterations incurs substantial computational costs and may even prove intractable in certain cases. To address these limitations, we integrate automatic differentiation (AD) into the NNR method, proposing a modified NNR method with AD (NNR-AD) to significantly improve its capability for effectively handling complex nonlinear systems. We have demonstrated that the NNR-AD method can directly solve dynamic systems with complex nonlinear characteristics, and its accuracy and generality have been rigorously validated. Furthermore, automatic differentiation significantly simplifies the computation of Jacobian matrices for such complex nonlinear dynamic systems. This improvement endows the NNR method with enhanced modularity, thereby enabling convenient and effective solutions for complex nonlinear dynamic systems."
2506.13231,"We present a novel combination of numerical techniques to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and robustness of multi-component compressible flow simulations. At the core of our approach is an Entropy-Stable formulation that preserves kinetic energy and integrates a Double-Flux scheme tailored for multi-component flows with variable specific heat ratios. This formulation yields low-dissipation, oscillation-free solutions and enhances stability compared to standard fully conservative methods. To further improve robustness, we introduce a new hybrid dissipation strategy that blends the Entropy-Stable/Double-Flux approach with conventional dissipation mechanisms. We provide a rigorous proof that the resulting numerical flux satisfies a semi-discrete entropy inequality, ensuring consistency with the second law of thermodynamics. For time integration, we employ an explicit Runge-Kutta scheme in combination with adaptive mesh refinement to capture local flow features dynamically. The method is implemented within an existing compressible Navier-Stokes solver based on OpenFOAM. Benchmark cases, including multi-dimensional interface and shock-interface interactions, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results confirm its favorable stability and robustness, validating the approach as a promising advancement for high-fidelity simulations of supersonic flows."
2506.13648,"Anisotropic material properties, such as the thermal conductivities of engineering composites, exhibit variability due to inherent material heterogeneity and manufacturing-related uncertainties. Mathematically, these properties are modeled as symmetric positive definite (SPD) tensors, which reside on a curved Riemannian manifold. Extending this description to a stochastic framework requires preserving both the SPD structure and the underlying spatial symmetries of the tensors. This is achieved through the spectral decomposition of tensors, which enables the parameterization of uncertainties into scale (strength) and rotation (orientation) components. To quantify the impact of strength and orientation uncertainties on the thermal behaviour of the composite, the stochastic material tensor must be propagated through a physics-based forward model. This process necessitates computationally efficient surrogate models, for which a feedforward neural network (FNN) is employed. However, conventional FNN architectures are not well-suited for SPD tensors, as directly using tensor components as input features fails to preserve their underlying geometric structure, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we introduce the Constitutive Manifold Neural Network (CMNN), which incorporates input layers that map SPD tensors from the curved manifold to the local tangent space-a flat vector space-thus preserving the statistical and geometric information in the dataset. A case study involving steady-state heat conduction with stochastic anisotropic conductivity demonstrates that geometry-preserving neural network significantly enhances learning performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). These findings underscore the importance of manifold-aware methods when working with tensor-valued data in engineering applications."
2506.1374,"Gene regulation is central to understanding cellular processes and development, potentially leading to the discovery of new treatments for diseases and personalized medicine. Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data presents significant challenges due to its high dimensionality and complexity. Existing tree-based models, such as GENIE3 and GRNBOOST2, demonstrated scalability and explainability in GRN inference, but they cannot distinguish regulation types nor effectively capture continuous cellular dynamics. In this paper, we introduce scKAN, a novel model that employs a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) with explainable AI to infer GRNs from scRNA-seq data. By modeling gene expression as differentiable functions matching the smooth nature of cellular dynamics, scKAN can accurately and precisely detect activation and inhibition regulations through explainable AI and geometric tools. We conducted extensive experiments on the BEELINE benchmark, and scKAN surpasses and improves the leading signed GRN inference models ranging from 5.40\% to 28.37\% in AUROC and from 1.97\% to 40.45\% in AUPRC. These results highlight the potential of scKAN in capturing the underlying biological processes in gene regulation without prior knowledge of the graph structure."
2506.14424,"This article investigates matrix-free higher-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of the Navier--Stokes equations for incompressible flows with variable viscosity. The viscosity field may be prescribed analytically or governed by a rheological law, as often found in biomedical or industrial applications. The DG discretization of the adapted second-order viscous terms is carried out via the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method, obviating auxiliary variables. Based on this spatial discretization, we compare several linearized variants of saddle point block systems and projection-based splitting time integration schemes in terms of their computational performance. Compared to the velocity-pressure block-system for the former, the splitting scheme allows solving a sequence of simple problems such as mass, convection-diffusion and Poisson equations. We investigate under which conditions the improved temporal stability of fully implicit schemes and resulting expensive nonlinear solves outperform the splitting schemes and linearized variants that are stable under hyperbolic time step restrictions.The key aspects of this work are i) a higher-order DG discretization for incompressible flows with variable viscosity, ii) accelerated nonlinear solver variants and suitable linearizations adopting a matrix-free $hp$-multigrid solver, and iii) a detailed comparison of the monolithic and projection-based solvers in terms of their (non-)linear solver performance.The presented schemes are evaluated in a series of numerical examples verifying their spatial and temporal accuracy, and the preconditioner performance under increasing viscosity contrasts, while their efficiency is showcased in the backward-facing step benchmark."
2506.14453,"Digital twins are transforming engineering and applied sciences by enabling real-time monitoring, simulation, and predictive analysis of physical systems and processes. However, conventional digital twins rely primarily on passive data assimilation, which limits their adaptability in uncertain and dynamic environments. This paper introduces the active digital twin paradigm, based on active inference. Active inference is a neuroscience-inspired, Bayesian framework for probabilistic reasoning and predictive modeling that unifies inference, decision-making, and learning under a unique, free energy minimization objective. By formulating the evolution of the active digital twin as a partially observable Markov decision process, the active inference agent continuously refines its generative model through Bayesian updates and forecasts future states and observations. Decision-making emerges from an optimization process that balances pragmatic exploitation (maximizing goal-directed utility) and epistemic exploration or information gain (actively resolving uncertainty). Actions are dynamically planned to minimize expected free energy, which quantifies both the divergence between predicted and preferred future observations, and the epistemic value of expected information gain about hidden states. This approach enables a new level of autonomy and resilience in digital twins, offering superior spontaneous exploration capabilities. The proposed framework is assessed on the health monitoring and predictive maintenance of a railway bridge."
2506.14638,"Extreme weather events increasingly threaten the insurance and real estate industries, creating conflicts between profitability and homeowner burdens. To address this, we propose the SSC-Insurance Model, which integrates SMOTE, SVM, and C-D-C algorithms to evaluate weather impacts on policies and investments. Our model achieves 88.3% accuracy in Zhejiang and 79.6% in Ireland, identifying a critical threshold (43% weather increase) for insurance viability. Additionally, we develop the TOA-Preservation Model using TOPSIS-ORM and AHP to prioritize building protection, with cultural value scoring highest (weight: 0.3383). Case studies on Nanxun Ancient Town show a 65.32% insurability probability and a protection score of 0.512.

2506.14768,"Layer 2 rollups are rapidly absorbing DeFi activity, securing over $40 billion and accounting for nearly half of Ethereum's DEX volume by Q1 2025, yet their MEV dynamics remain understudied. We address this gap by defining and quantifying optimistic MEV, a form of speculative, on-chain MEV whose detection and execution logic reside largely on-chain in smart contracts. As a result of their speculative nature and lack of off-chain opportunity verification, optimistic MEV transactions frequently decide not to execute any trades.In this work, we focus on cyclic arbitrage, which we find is predominantly executed as optimistic MEV on Layer 2s. Using our multi-stage identification pipeline on Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism, we show that in Q1 2025, transactions from cyclic arbitrage contracts account for over 50% of on-chain gas on Base and Optimism and 7% on Arbitrum, driven mainly by ""interaction"" probes (on-chain computations searching for arbitrage). This speculative probing indicates that cyclic arbitrage on Layer 2s is predominantly executed as optimistic MEV and contributes to generally keeping blocks on Base and Optimism persistently full. Despite consuming over half of on-chain gas, these optimistic MEV transactions pay less than one quarter of total gas fees. Cross-network comparison reveals divergent success rates, differing patterns of code reuse, and sensitivity to varying sequencer ordering and block production times. Finally, OLS regressions link optimistic MEV trade count to ETH volatility, retail trading activity, and DEX aggregator usage. Together, these findings show that optimistic MEV has become a major source of persistent spam-like transaction activity on Layer 2s, dominating blockspace with low-value probes and reshaping the composition of on-chain activity."

Thus, it is necessary to implement automated detection tools related to policies to address the growing criminality in the cryptocurrency realm."
2506.15263,"Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems like cars, trains or airplanes. Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required. We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives, including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design heuristic and genetic optimization.

2506.15405,"Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively used to represent various physical systems across multiple scientific domains. The same can be said for cardiac electrophysiology, wherein fully-connected neural networks (FCNNs) have been employed to predict the evolution of an action potential in a 2D space following the two-parameter phenomenological Aliev-Panfilov (AP) model. In this paper, the training behaviour of PINNs is investigated to determine optimal hyperparameters to predict the electrophysiological activity of the myocardium in 3D according to the AP model, with the inclusion of boundary and material parameters. An FCNN architecture is employed with the governing partial differential equations in their strong form, which are scaled consistently with normalization of network inputs. The finite element (FE) method is used to generate training data for the network. Numerical examples with varying spatial dimensions and parameterizations are generated using the trained models. The network predicted fields for both the action potential and the recovery variable are compared with the respective FE simulations. Network losses are weighed with individual scalar values. Their effect on training and prediction is studied to arrive at a method of controlling losses during training."
2506.16013,"Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is widely used for dimensionality reduction and data analysis. However, PCA results are adversely affected by outliers often observed in real-world data. Existing robust PCA methods are often computationally expensive or exhibit limited robustness. In this work, we introduce a Fast Iterative Robust (FIR) PCA method by efficiently estimating the inliers center location and covariance. Our approach leverages Incremental PCA (IPCA) to iteratively construct a subset of data points that ensures improved location and covariance estimation that effectively mitigates the influence of outliers on PCA projection. We demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy and performance compared to existing robust location and covariance methods while offering improved robustness to outlier contamination. We utilize simulated and real-world datasets to evaluate and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in identifying and preserving underlying data structures in the presence of contamination."
2506.16376,"The PMCHWT integral equation enables the modelling of scattering of time-harmonic fields by penetrable, piecewise homogeneous, systems. They have been generalised to include the modelling of composite systems that may contain junctions, i.e. lines along which three or more materials meet. Linear systems resulting upon discretisation of the PMCHWT are, because of their large dimension, typically solved by Krylov iterative methods. The number of iterations required for this solution critically depends on the eigenvalue distribution of the system matrix. For systems that do not contain junction lines, Calderón preconditioning, which was first applied to the electric field integral equation, has been generalised to the PMCHWT equation. When junctions are present, this approach cannot be applied. Alternative approaches, such as the global multi-trace method, conceptually remove the junction lines and as a result are amenable to Calderón preconditioning. This approach entails a doubling of the degrees of freedom, and the solution that is produced only approximately fulfils the continuity conditions at interfaces separating domains. In this contribution, a single trace quasi-local PMCHWT equation is introduced that requires a number of iterations for its solution that only slowly increases as the mesh size tends to zero. The method is constructed as a generalisation of the classic PMCHWT, and its discretisation is thoroughly discussed. A comprehensive suite of numerical experiments demonstrates the correctness, convergence behaviour, and efficiency of the method. The integral equation is demonstrated to be free from interior resonances."

2506.16746,"Stock selection, which aims to predict stock prices and identify the most profitable ones, is a crucial task in finance. While existing methods primarily focus on developing model structures and building graphs for improved selection, pre-training strategies remain underexplored in this domain. Current stock series pre-training follows methods from other areas without adapting to the unique characteristics of financial data, particularly overlooking stock-specific contextual information and the non-stationary nature of stock prices. Consequently, the latent statistical features inherent in stock data are underutilized. In this paper, we propose three novel pre-training tasks tailored to stock data characteristics: stock code classification, stock sector classification, and moving average prediction. We develop the Stock Specialized Pre-trained Transformer (SSPT) based on a two-layer transformer architecture. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our pre-training methods and provide detailed guidance on their application. Evaluations on five stock datasets, including four markets and two time periods, demonstrate that SSPT consistently outperforms the market and existing methods in terms of both cumulative investment return ratio and Sharpe ratio. Additionally, our experiments on simulated data investigate the underlying mechanisms of our methods, providing insights into understanding price series.

2506.16813,"Traditional technical analysis methods face limitations in accurately predicting trends in today's complex financial markets. This paper introduces ElliottAgents, an multi-agent system that integrates the Elliott Wave Principle with AI for stock market forecasting. The inherent complexity of financial markets, characterized by non-linear dynamics, noise, and susceptibility to unpredictable external factors, poses significant challenges for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, the system employs LLMs to enhance natural language understanding and decision-making capabilities within a multi-agent framework. By leveraging technologies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), ElliottAgents performs continuous, multi-faceted analysis of market data to identify wave patterns and predict future price movements. The research explores the system's ability to process historical stock data, recognize Elliott wave patterns, and generate actionable insights for traders. Experimental results, conducted on historical data from major U.S. companies, validate the system's effectiveness in pattern recognition and trend forecasting across various time frames.

2506.16993,"Systems for the generation and distribution of electrical power represents critical infrastructure and, when extreme weather events disrupt such systems, this imposes substantial costs on consumers. These costs can be conceptualized as deprivation costs, an increasing function of time without service, quantifiable through individuals' willingness to pay for power restoration. Despite widespread recognition of outage impacts, a gap in the research literature exists regarding the systematic measurement of deprivation costs. This study addresses this deficiency by developing and implementing a methodology to estimate deprivation cost functions for electricity outages, using stated preference survey data collected from Harris County, Texas. This study compares multiple discrete choice model architectures, including multinomial logit and mixed logit specifications, as well as models incorporating BoxCox and exponential utility transformations for the deprivation time attribute. The analysis examines heterogeneity in deprivation valuation through sociodemographic interactions, particularly across income groups. Results confirm that power outage deprivation cost functions are convex and strictly increasing with time. Additionally, the study reveals both systematic and random taste variation in how individuals value power loss, highlighting the need for flexible modeling approaches. By providing both methodological and empirical foundations for incorporating deprivation costs into infrastructure risk assessments and humanitarian logistics, this research enables policymakers to better quantify service disruption costs and develop more equitable resilience strategies."
2506.17224,"Hydrogen's role is growing as an energy carrier, increasing the need for efficient production, with methane steam reforming being the most widely used technique. This process is crucial for applications like fuel cells, where hydrogen is converted into electricity, pushing for reactor miniaturization and optimized process control through numerical simulations. Existing models typically address either kinetic or equilibrium regimes, limiting their applicability. Here we show a surrogate model capable of unifying both regimes. An artificial neural network trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes experimental data from kinetic and equilibrium experiments, interpolated data, and theoretical data derived from theoretical models for each regime. Data augmentation and assigning appropriate weights to each data type enhanced training. After evaluating Bayesian Optimization and Random Sampling, the optimal model demonstrated high predictive accuracy for the composition of the post-reaction mixture under varying operating parameters, indicated by a mean squared error of 0.000498 and strong Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.927. The network's ability to provide continuous derivatives of its predictions makes it particularly useful for process modeling and optimization. The results confirm the surrogate model's robustness for simulating methane steam reforming in both kinetic and equilibrium regimes, making it a valuable tool for design and process optimization."
2506.17487,"A variational framework for structural topology optimization is developed, integrating quantum and classical latent encoding strategies within a coordinate-based neural decoding architecture. In this approach, a low-dimensional latent vector, generated either by a variational quantum circuit or sampled from a Gaussian distribution, is mapped to a higher-dimensional latent space via a learnable projection layer. This enriched representation is then decoded into a high-resolution material distribution using a neural network that takes both the latent vector and Fourier-mapped spatial coordinates as input. The optimization is performed directly on the latent parameters, guided solely by physics-based objectives such as compliance minimization and volume constraints evaluated through finite element analysis, without requiring any precomputed datasets or supervised training. Quantum latent vectors are constructed from the expectation values of Pauli observables measured on parameterized quantum circuits, providing a structured and entangled encoding of information. The classical baseline uses Gaussian-sampled latent vectors projected in the same manner. The proposed variational formulation enables the generation of diverse and physically valid topologies by exploring the latent space through sampling or perturbation, in contrast to traditional optimization methods that yield a single deterministic solution. Numerical experiments show that both classical and quantum encodings produce high-quality structural designs. However, quantum encodings demonstrate advantages in several benchmark cases in terms of compliance and design diversity. These results highlight the potential of quantum circuits as an effective and scalable tool for physics-constrained topology optimization and suggest promising directions for applying near-term quantum hardware in structural design."
2506.1783,"In this article, we introduce a finite element method designed for the robust computation of approximate signed distance functions to arbitrary boundaries in two and three dimensions. Our method employs a novel prediction-correction approach, involving first the solution of a linear diffusion-based prediction problem, followed by a nonlinear minimization-based correction problem associated with the Eikonal equation. The prediction step efficiently generates a suitable initial guess, significantly facilitating convergence of the nonlinear correction step. A key strength of our approach is its ability to handle complex interfaces and initial level set functions with arbitrary steep or flat regions, a notable challenge for existing techniques. Through several representative examples, including classical geometries and more complex shapes such as star domains and three-dimensional tori, we demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the method, validating its broad applicability for reinitializing diverse level set functions."
2506.17964,"Florida is particularly vulnerable to hurricanes, which frequently cause substantial economic losses. While prior studies have explored specific contributors to hurricane-induced damage, few have developed a unified framework capable of integrating a broader range of influencing factors to comprehensively assess the sources of economic loss. In this study, we propose a comprehensive modeling framework that categorizes contributing factors into three key components: (1) hurricane characteristics, (2) water-related environmental factors, and (3) socioeconomic factors of affected areas. By integrating multi-source data and aggregating all variables at the finer spatial granularity of the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level, we employ machine learning models to predict economic loss, using insurance claims as indicators of incurred damage. Beyond accurate loss prediction, our approach facilitates a systematic assessment of the relative importance of each component, providing practical guidance for disaster mitigation, risk assessment, and the development of adaptive urban strategies in coastal and storm-exposed areas.

2506.18161,"Recent years have seen a significant interest in using phase field approaches to model hydraulic fracture, so as to optimise a process that is key to industries such as petroleum engineering, mining and geothermal energy extraction. Here, we present a novel theoretical and computational phase field framework to simulate hydraulic fracture. The framework is general and versatile, in that it allows for improved treatments of the coupling between fluid flow and the phase field, and encompasses a universal description of the fracture driving force. Among others, this allows us to bring two innovations to the phase field hydraulic fracture community: (i) a new hybrid coupling approach to handle the fracture-fluid flow interplay, offering enhanced accuracy and flexibility; and (ii) a Drucker-Prager-based strain energy decomposition, extending the simulation of hydraulic fracture to materials exhibiting asymmetric tension-compression fracture behaviour (such as shale rocks) and enabling the prediction of geomechanical phenomena such as fault reactivation and stick-slip behaviour. Four case studies are addressed to illustrate these additional modelling capabilities and bring insight into permeability coupling, cracking behaviour, and multiaxial conditions in hydraulic fracturing simulations. The codes developed are made freely available to the community and can be downloaded from {this https URL"
2506.18175,"This study builds a bridge between two well-studied but distant topics: fractal dimension and Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS). DGGSs are used as covering sets for geospatial vector data to calculate the Minkowski-Bouligand dimension. Using the method on synthetic data yields results within 1% of their theoretical fractal dimensions. A case study on opaque cloud fields obtained from satellite images gives fractal dimension in agreement with that available in the literature. The proposed method alleviates the problems of arbitrary grid placement and orientation, as well as the progression of cell sizes of the covering sets for geospatial data. Using DGGSs further ensure that intersections of the covering sets with the geospatial vector having large geographic extents are calculated by taking the curvature of the earth into account. This paper establishes the validity of DGGSs as covering sets theoretically and discusses desirable properties of DGGSs suitable for this purpose."
2506.18206,"This paper presents a new data-driven finite element framework that is applicable to a broad range of engineering simulation problems. In the data-driven approach, the conservation laws and boundary conditions are satisfied by means of the finite element method, while the experimental data is used directly in numerical simulations, avoiding material models. Critically, we introduce a ""weaker'"" mixed finite element formulation, which relaxes the regularity requirements on the approximation space for the primary field. At the same time, the continuity of the normal flux component is enforced across inner boundaries, allowing the conservation law to be satisfied in the strong sense. The relaxed regularity of the approximation spaces makes it easier to observe how imperfections in the datasets, such as missing or noisy data, result in non-uniqueness of the solution. This can be quantified to predict the uncertainty of the results using methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. Furthermore, this formulation provides a posteriori error indicators tailored for the data-driven approach, providing confidence in the results and enabling efficient solution schemes via adaptive hp-refinement. The capabilities of the formulation are demonstrated on an example of the nonlinear heat transfer in nuclear graphite using synthetically generated material datasets. This work provides an essential component for numerical frameworks for complex engineering systems such as digital twins."
2506.18227,"We propose an efficient framework for amortized conditional inference by leveraging exact conditional score-guided diffusion models to train a non-reversible neural network as a conditional generative model. Traditional normalizing flow methods require reversible architectures, which can limit their expressiveness and efficiency. Although diffusion models offer greater flexibility, they often suffer from high computational costs during inference. To combine the strengths of both approaches, we introduce a two-stage method. First, we construct a training-free conditional diffusion model by analytically deriving an exact score function under a Gaussian mixture prior formed from samples of the underlying joint distribution. This exact conditional score model allows us to efficiently generate noise-labeled data, consisting of initial diffusion Gaussian noise and posterior samples conditioned on various observation values, by solving a reverse-time ordinary differential equation. Second, we use this noise-labeled data to train a feedforward neural network that maps noise and observations directly to posterior samples, eliminating the need for reversibility or iterative sampling at inference time. The resulting model provides fast, accurate, and scalable conditional sampling for high-dimensional and multi-modal posterior distributions, making it well-suited for uncertainty quantification tasks, e.g., parameter estimation of complex physical systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a series of numerical experiments."
2506.18427,"The finite element method (FEM) is a well-established numerical method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, its mesh-based nature gives rise to substantial computational costs, especially for complex multiscale simulations. Emerging machine learning-based methods (e.g., neural operators) provide data-driven solutions to PDEs, yet they present challenges, including high training cost and low model reusability. Here, we propose the neural-operator element method (NOEM) by synergistically combining FEM with operator learning to address these challenges. NOEM leverages neural operators (NOs) to simulate subdomains where a large number of finite elements would be required if FEM was used. In each subdomain, an NO is used to build a single element, namely a neural-operator element (NOE). NOEs are then integrated with standard finite elements to represent the entire solution through the variational framework. Thereby, NOEM does not necessitate dense meshing and offers efficient simulations. We demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of NOEM by performing extensive and systematic numerical experiments, including nonlinear PDEs, multiscale problems, PDEs on complex geometries, and discontinuous coefficient fields."
2506.18554,"We combine state-of-the-art thermo-metallurgical welding process modelling with coupled diffusion-elastic-plastic phase field fracture simulations to predict the failure states of hydrogen transport pipelines. This enables quantitatively resolving residual stress states and the role of brittle, hard regions of the weld such as the heat affected zone (HAZ). Failure pressures can be efficiently quantified as a function of asset state (existing defects), materials and weld procedures adopted, and hydrogen purity. Importantly, simulations spanning numerous relevant conditions (defect size and orientations) are used to build \emph{Virtual} Failure Assessment Diagrams (FADs), enabling a straightforward uptake of this mechanistic approach in fitness-for-service assessment. Model predictions are in very good agreement with FAD approaches from the standards but show that the latter are not conservative when resolving the heterogeneous nature of the weld microstructure. Appropriate, \emph{mechanistic} FAD safety factors are established that account for the role of residual stresses and hard, brittle weld regions."
2506.18565,"Modeling viscoelastic behavior is crucial in engineering and biomechanics, where materials undergo time-dependent deformations, including stress relaxation, creep buckling and biological tissue development. Traditional numerical methods, like the finite element method, often require explicit meshing, artificial perturbations or embedding customised programs to capture these phenomena, adding computational complexity. In this study, we develop an energy-based physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework using an incremental approach to model viscoelastic creep, stress relaxation, buckling, and growth-induced morphogenesis. Physics consistency is ensured by training neural networks to minimize the systems potential energy functional, implicitly satisfying equilibrium and constitutive laws. We demonstrate that this framework can naturally capture creep buckling without pre-imposed imperfections, leveraging inherent training dynamics to trigger instabilities. Furthermore, we extend our framework to biological tissue growth and morphogenesis, predicting both uniform expansion and differential growth-induced buckling in cylindrical structures. Results show that the energy-based PINN effectively predicts viscoelastic instabilities, post-buckling evolution and tissue morphological evolution, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods. This study demonstrates that PINN can be a flexible robust tool for modeling complex, time-dependent material behavior, opening possible applications in structural engineering, soft materials, and tissue development."
2506.18572,"Inspection and maintenance of offshore platforms are associated with high costs, primarily due to the significant personnel requirements and challenging operational conditions. This paper first presents a classification of Power to X platforms. Building upon this foundation, a communication architecture is proposed to enable monitoring, control, and teleoperation for a Power to X platform. To reduce the demand for human labor, a robotic system is integrated to autonomously perform inspection and maintenance tasks. The implementation utilizes a quadruped robot. Remote monitoring, control, and teleoperation of the robot are analyzed within the context of a 5G standalone network. As part of the evaluation, aspects such as availability and latency are recorded, compared, and critically assessed."
2506.18717,"Stock price prediction is vital for investment decisions and risk management, yet remains challenging due to markets' nonlinear dynamics and time-varying inter-stock correlations. Traditional static-correlation models fail to capture evolving stock relationships. To address this, we propose a Differential Graph Transformer (DGT) framework for dynamic relationship modeling and price prediction. Our DGT integrates sequential graph structure changes into multi-head self-attention via a differential graph mechanism, adaptively preserving high-value connections while suppressing noise. Causal temporal attention captures global/local dependencies in price sequences. We further evaluate correlation metrics (Pearson, Mutual Information, Spearman, Kendall's Tau) across global/local/dual scopes as spatial-attention priors. Using 10 years of S&P 500 closing prices (z-score normalized; 64-day sliding windows), DGT with spatial priors outperformed GRU baselines (RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87). Kendall's Tau global matrices yielded optimal results (MAE: 0.11). K-means clustering revealed ""high-volatility growth"" and ""defensive blue-chip"" stocks, with the latter showing lower errors (RMSE: 0.13) due to stable correlations. Kendall's Tau and Mutual Information excelled in volatile sectors. This study innovatively combines differential graph structures with Transformers, validating dynamic relationship modeling and identifying optimal correlation metrics/scopes. Clustering analysis supports tailored quantitative strategies. Our framework advances financial time-series prediction through dynamic modeling and cross-asset interaction analysis."
2506.18724,"Precise and timely simulation of a structure's dynamic behavior is crucial for evaluating its performance and assessing its health status. Traditional numerical methods are often limited by high computational costs and low efficiency, while deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative. However, these data-driven methods still face challenges, such as limited physical interpretability and difficulty in adapting to diverse structural configurations. To address these issues, this study proposes a graph-based digital twin modelling (GDTM) framework to simulate structural dynamic responses across various spatial topologies. In this framework, the adjacency matrix explicitly represents the spatial relationships between structural vertices, enhancing the model's physical interpretability. The effectiveness of the proposed framework was validated through comprehensive numerical and experimental studies. The results demonstrate that the framework accurately simulated structural dynamics across different topological configurations, with Normalized Mean-Squared Error (NMSE) values consistently below 0.005 in numerical simulations and 0.0015 in experimental validations. Furthermore, the framework achieved over 80-fold improvements in computational efficiency compared to traditional finite element methods (FEM). This research promotes the practical application of graph-based structural dynamics modelling, which has the potential to significantly advance structural performance evaluation and health monitoring."
2506.18853,"Skeletal reaction models are derived for a four-component gasoline surrogate model via an instantaneous local sensitivity analysis technique. The sensitivities of the species mass fractions and the temperature with respect to the reaction rates are estimated by a reduced-order modeling (ROM) methodology. Termed ""implicit time-dependent basis CUR (implicit TDB-CUR),"" this methodology is based on the CUR matrix decomposition and incorporates implicit time integration for evolving the bases. The estimated sensitivities are subsequently analyzed to develop skeletal reaction models with a fully automated procedure. The 1389-species gasoline surrogate model developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is selected as the detailed kinetics model. The skeletal reduction procedure is applied to this model in a zero-dimensional constant-pressure reactor over a wide range of initial conditions. The performances of the resulting skeletal models are appraised by comparison against the results via the LLNL detailed model, and also predictions via other skeletal models. Two new skeletal models are developed consisting of 679 and 494 species, respectively. The first is an alternative to an existing model with the same number of species. The predictions with this model reproduces the detailed models vital flame results with less than 1% errors. The errors via the second model are less than 10%."
2506.19049,"Uplift modeling has achieved significant success in various fields, particularly in online marketing. It is a method that primarily utilizes machine learning and deep learning to estimate individual treatment effects. This paper we apply uplift modeling to analyze the effect of company adjustment on their financial status, and we treat these adjustment as treatments or interventions in this study. Although there have been extensive studies and application regarding binary treatments, multiple treatments, and continuous treatments, company adjustment are often more complex than these scenarios, as they constitute a series of multiple time-dependent actions. The effect estimation of company adjustment needs to take into account not only individual treatment traits but also the temporal order of this series of treatments. This study collects a real-world data set about company financial statements and reported behavior in Luxembourg for the experiments. First, we use two meta-learners and three other well-known uplift models to analyze different company adjustment by simplifying the adjustment as binary treatments. Furthermore, we propose a new uplift modeling framework (MTDnet) to address the time-dependent nature of these adjustment, and the experimental result shows the necessity of considering the timing of these adjustment."
2506.19118,"Despite the notable success of current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods across various domains, their effectiveness on medical datasets falls short of expectations. This limitation arises from two key factors: (1) medical images exhibit extensive anatomical variation and low contrast, necessitating a large receptive field to capture critical features, and (2) existing PEFT methods do not explicitly address the enhancement of receptive fields. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Large Kernel Adapter (LKA), designed to expand the receptive field while maintaining parameter efficiency. The proposed LKA consists of three key components: down-projection, channel-wise large kernel convolution, and up-projection. Through extensive experiments on various datasets and pre-trained models, we demonstrate that the incorporation of a larger kernel size is pivotal in enhancing the adaptation of pre-trained models for medical image analysis. Our proposed LKA outperforms 11 commonly used PEFT methods, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 3.5% in top-1 accuracy across five medical datasets."

2506.19534,"In computational engineering, ensuring the integrity and safety of structures in fields such as aerospace and civil engineering relies on accurate stress prediction. However, analytical methods are limited to simple test cases, and displacement-based finite element methods (FEMs), while commonly used, require a large number of unknowns to achieve high accuracy; stress-based numerical methods have so far failed to provide a simple and effective alternative. This work aims to develop a novel numerical approach that overcomes these limitations by enabling accurate stress prediction with improved flexibility for complex geometries and boundary conditions and fewer degrees of freedom (DOFs). The proposed method is based on a spline-based stress function formulation for the principle of minimum complementary energy, which we apply to plane, linear elastostatics. The method is first validated against analytical solutions and then tested on two test cases challenging for current state-of-the-art numerical schemes, a bi-layer cantilever with anisotropic material behavior, and a cantilever with a non-prismatic, parabolic-shaped beam geometry. Results demonstrate that our approach, unlike analytical methods, can be easily applied to general geometries and boundary conditions, and achieves stress accuracy comparable to that reported in the literature for displacement-based FEMs, while requiring significantly fewer DOFs. This novel spline-based stress function approach thus provides an efficient and flexible tool for accurate stress prediction, with promising applications in structural analysis and numerical design."
2506.1961,"Recent advances in multimodal techniques have led to significant progress in Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA). However, most existing models focus on global image features rather than localizing disease-specific regions crucial for diagnosis. Additionally, current research tends to emphasize answer accuracy at the expense of the reasoning pathway, yet both are crucial for clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose From Vision to Text Chain-of-Thought (V2T-CoT), a novel approach that automates the localization of preference areas within biomedical images and incorporates this localization into region-level pixel attention as knowledge for Vision CoT. By fine-tuning the vision language model on constructed R-Med 39K dataset, V2T-CoT provides definitive medical reasoning paths. V2T-CoT integrates visual grounding with textual rationale generation to establish precise and explainable diagnostic results. Experimental results across four Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving substantial improvements in both performance and interpretability."
2506.19657,"The Circular Economy framework emphasizes sustainability by reducing resource consumption and waste through the reuse of components and materials. This paper presents ReLink, a computational framework for the circular design of planar linkage mechanisms using available standard parts. Unlike most mechanism design methods, which assume the ability to create custom parts and infinite part availability, ReLink prioritizes the reuse of discrete, standardized components, thus minimizing the need for new parts. The framework consists of two main components: design generation, where a generative design algorithm generates mechanisms from an inventory of available parts, and inverse design, which uses optimization methods to identify designs that match a user-defined trajectory curve. The paper also examines the trade-offs between kinematic performance and CO2 footprint when incorporating new parts. Challenges such as the combinatorial nature of the design problem and the enforcement of valid solutions are addressed. By combining sustainability principles with kinematic synthesis, ReLink lays the groundwork for further research into computational circular design to support the development of systems that integrate reused components into mechanical products."
2506.19751,"Simulation-driven development of intelligent machines benefits from artificial terrains with controllable, well-defined characteristics. However, most existing tools for terrain generation focus on artist-driven workflows and visual realism, with limited support for parameterization, reproducibility, or scripting. We present a modular, Python-based library for procedural terrain generation that enables users to construct complex, parameterized terrains by chaining together simple modules. The system supports both structured and noise-based terrain elements, and integrates with Blender for rendering and object placement. The framework is designed to support applications such as generating synthetic terrains for training machine learning models or producing ground truth for perception tasks. By using a minimal but extensible set of modules, the system achieves high flexibility while remaining easy to configure and expand. We demonstrate that this enables fine-grained control over features such as slope, roughness, and the number of rocks, as well as extension to additional measures. This makes it well suited for workflows that demand reproducibility, variation, and integration with automated pipelines."
2506.20123,"The detection of malicious accounts on Ethereum - the preeminent DeFi platform - is critical for protecting digital assets and maintaining trust in decentralized finance. Recent advances highlight that temporal transaction evolution reveals more attack signatures than static graphs. However, current methods either fail to model continuous transaction dynamics or incur high computational costs that limit scalability to large-scale transaction networks. Furthermore, current methods fail to consider two higher-order behavioral fingerprints: (1) direction in temporal transaction flows, which encodes money movement trajectories, and (2) account clustering, which reveals coordinated behavior of organized malicious collectives. To address these challenges, we propose DiT-SGCR, an unsupervised graph encoder for malicious account detection. Specifically, DiT-SGCR employs directional temporal aggregation to capture dynamic account interactions, then coupled with differentiable clustering and graph Laplacian regularization to generate high-quality, low-dimensional embeddings. Our approach simultaneously encodes directional temporal dynamics, global topology, and cluster-specific behavioral patterns, thereby enhancing the discriminability and robustness of account representations. Furthermore, DiT-SGCR bypasses conventional graph propagation mechanisms, yielding significant scalability advantages. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that DiT-SGCR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks, achieving F1-score improvements ranging from 3.62% to 10.83%."
2506.20148,"Humans can possess good mechanics intuitions by learning from a few examples, which leads to the question of how to develop artificial mechanics intuitions that can be learned from small data, as we are eagerly entering the era of artificial intelligence. We propose in this Letter the sample-switchable training method, which successfully develops highly-accurate artificial mechanics intuitions that can master brachistochrone problem, catenary problem, and large nonlinear deformation problem of elastic plate by learning from no more than three samples. The model's intuitive prediction ability increases nonlinearly with respect to the number of training samples, suggesting that superb mechanics intuitions can be in-principle achieved based on a finite number of samples, reflecting how human brains form good mechanics intuitions just by learning a few cases. Our current work presents an alternative perspective for educating artificial intelligence capable of intuitively understand and predict how materials deform and move, a scenario that has been frequently seen in Science-Fiction movies."
2506.20472,"Opinion Dynamics (OD) models are a particular case of Agent-Based Models in which the evolution of opinions within a population is studied. In most OD models, opinions evolve as a consequence of interactions between agents, and the opinion fusion rule defines how those opinions are updated. In consequence, despite being simplistic, OD models provide an explainable and interpretable mechanism for understanding the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution. Unfortunately, existing OD models mainly focus on explaining the evolution of (usually synthetic) opinions towards consensus, fragmentation, or polarization, but they usually fail to analyze scenarios of (real-world) highly oscillating opinions. This work overcomes this limitation by studying the ability of several OD models to reproduce highly oscillating dynamics. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem which is further solved using Evolutionary Algorithms, providing both quantitative results on the performance of the optimization and qualitative interpretations on the obtained results. Our experiments on a real-world opinion dataset about immigration from the monthly barometer of the Spanish Sociological Research Center show that the ATBCR, based on both rational and emotional mechanisms of opinion update, is the most accurate OD model for capturing highly oscillating opinions."

2506.20773,"An efficient numerical framework is presented for modeling viscoelasticity and permanent set of polymers. It is based on the hereditary integral form of transient network theory, in which polymer chains belong to distinct networks each with different natural equilibrium states. Chains continually detach from previously formed networks and reattach to new networks in a state of zero stress. The free energy of these networks is given in terms of the deformation gradient relative to the configuration at which the network was born. A decomposition of the kernel for various free energies allows for a recurrence relationship to be established, bypassing the need to integrate over all time history. The technique is established for both highly compressible and nearly incompressible materials through the use of neo-Hookean, Blatz-Ko, Yeoh, and Ogden-Hill material models. Multiple examples are presented showing the ability to handle rate-dependent response and residual strains under complex loading histories."
2506.21362,"Efficient access to high-quality information is vital for online platforms. To promote more useful information, users not only create new content but also evaluate existing content, often through helpfulness voting. Although aggregated votes help service providers rank their user content, these votes are often biased by disparate accessibility per position and the cascaded influence of prior votes. For a fairer assessment of information quality, we propose the Counterfactual Voting Adjustment (CVA), a causal framework that accounts for the context in which individual votes are cast. Through preliminary and semi-synthetic experiments, we show that CVA effectively models the position and herding biases, accurately recovering the predefined content quality. In a real experiment, we demonstrate that reranking content based on the learned quality by CVA exhibits stronger alignment with both user sentiment and quality evaluation assessed by GPT-4o, outperforming system rankings based on aggregated votes and model-based rerankings without causal inference. Beyond the individual quality inference, our embeddings offer comparative insights into the behavioral dynamics of expert user groups across 120 major StackExchange communities."
2506.21743,"Storm surge forecasting plays a crucial role in coastal disaster preparedness, yet existing machine learning approaches often suffer from limited spatial resolution, reliance on coastal station data, and poor generalization. Moreover, many prior models operate directly on unstructured spatial data, making them incompatible with modern deep learning architectures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that projects unstructured water elevation fields onto structured Red Green Blue (RGB)-encoded image representations, enabling the application of Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) networks for end-to-end spatiotemporal surge forecasting. Our model further integrates ground-truth wind fields as dynamic conditioning signals and topo-bathymetry as a static input, capturing physically meaningful drivers of surge evolution. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of synthetic storms in the Gulf of Mexico, our method demonstrates robust 48-hour forecasting performance across multiple regions along the Texas coast and exhibits strong spatial extensibility to other coastal areas. By combining structured representation, physically grounded forcings, and scalable deep learning, this study advances the frontier of storm surge forecasting in usability, adaptability, and interpretability."
2506.21815,"Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is a widely recognized additive manufacturing technology for producing intricate metal components with exceptional accuracy. A key challenge in L-PBF is the formation of complex microstructures affecting product quality. We propose a physics-guided, machine-learning approach to optimize scan paths for desired microstructure outcomes, such as equiaxed grains. We utilized a phase-field method (PFM) to model crystalline grain structure evolution. To reduce computational costs, we trained a surrogate machine learning model, a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network, using single-track phase-field simulations with various laser powers to predict crystalline grain orientations based on initial microstructure and thermal history. We investigated three scanning strategies across various hatch spacings within a square domain, achieving a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup using the surrogate model. To reduce trial and error in designing laser scan toolpaths, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate optimized scan paths for target microstructure. Results from three cases demonstrate the DRL approach's effectiveness. We integrated the surrogate 3D U-Net model into our DRL environment to accelerate the reinforcement learning training process. The reward function minimizes both aspect ratio and grain volume of the predicted microstructure from the agent's scan path. The reinforcement learning algorithm was benchmarked against conventional zigzag approach for smaller and larger domains, showing machine learning methods' potential to enhance microstructure control and computational efficiency in L-PBF optimization."
2506.21918,"Recent research has demonstrated Reservoir Computing's capability to model various chaotic dynamical systems, yet its application to Hamiltonian systems remains relatively unexplored. This paper investigates the effectiveness of Reservoir Computing in capturing rogue wave dynamics from the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, a challenging Hamiltonian system with modulation instability. The model-free approach learns from breather simulations with five unstable modes. A properly tuned parallel Echo State Network can predict dynamics from two distinct testing datasets. The first set is a continuation of the training data, whereas the second set involves a higher-order breather. An investigation of the one-step prediction capability shows remarkable agreement between the testing data and the models. Furthermore, we show that the trained reservoir can predict the propagation of rogue waves over a relatively long prediction horizon, despite facing unseen dynamics. Finally, we introduce a method to significantly improve the Reservoir Computing prediction in autonomous mode, enhancing its long-term forecasting ability. These results advance the application of Reservoir Computing to spatio-temporal Hamiltonian systems and highlight the critical importance of phase space coverage in the design of training data."

As advancements in medical technology and cancer treatment continue, the demand for oncology medications is steadily increasing. Accurate forecasting of cancer drug sales plays a critical role in optimizing production planning, supply chain management, and healthcare policy formulation. The dataset used in this research comprises quarterly sales records of a specific cancer drug in Egypt from 2015 to 2024, including multidimensional information such as date, drug type, pharmaceutical company, price, sales volume, effectiveness, and drug classification. To improve prediction accuracy, a hybrid deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is employed. The CNN component is responsible for extracting local temporal features from the sales data, while the LSTM component captures long-term dependencies and trends. Model performance is evaluated using two widely adopted metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results demonstrate that the CNN-LSTM model performs well on the test set, achieving an MSE of 1.150 and an RMSE of 1.072, indicating its effectiveness in handling nonlinear and volatile sales data.

2506.2287,"The landing gear system is a major aircraft subsystem that must withstand extreme forces during ground maneuvers and absorb vibrations. While traditional systems perform well under normal conditions, their efficiency drops under varying landing and runway scenarios. This study addresses this issue by simultaneously optimizing controller coefficients, parameters of a nonlinear hydraulic actuator integrated into the traditional shock absorber, and a vibration absorber using a bee-inspired multi-objective algorithm. To demonstrate adaptability, the paper includes sensitivity analysis for three-point landings affected by added payload and touchdown speed, and robustness analysis for one- and two-point landings under emergency wind conditions. The dynamic flight equations of an Airbus A320-200 during landing are derived and solved numerically. Results show that the active shock absorber system, optimized via two bee-based algorithms, outperforms the passive system in reducing bounce and pitch displacements and momenta, suspension travel, and impact force in both time and frequency domains. This leads to significantly improved passenger comfort and potentially longer structural fatigue life, demonstrating industrial applicability."
2506.22944,"This study introduces the first 3D spectral-element method (SEM) simulation of ultrasonic wave propagation in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) head. Unlike traditional finite-element methods (FEM), which struggle with high-frequency simulations due to costly linear-system inversions and slower convergence, SEM offers exponential convergence and efficient parallel computation. Using Computed Tomography (CT) scan data, we developed a detailed hexahedral mesh capturing complex anatomical features, such as acoustic fats and jaws. Our simulations of plane and spherical waves confirm SEM's effectiveness for ultrasonic time-domain modeling. This approach opens new avenues for marine biology, contributing to research in echolocation, the impacts of anthropogenic marine noise pollution and the biophysics of hearing and click generation in marine mammals. By overcoming FEM's limitations, SEM provides a powerful scalable tool to test hypotheses about dolphin bioacoustics, with significant implications for conservation and understanding marine mammal auditory systems under increasing environmental challenges."

SparStencil introduces three key techniques: (1) Adaptive Layout Morphing, which restructures stencil patterns into staircase-aligned sparse matrices via a flatten-and-crush pipeline; (2) Structured Sparsity Conversion, which formulates transformation as a graph matching problem to ensure compatibility with 2:4 sparsity constraints; (3) Automatic Kernel Generation, which compiles transformed stencils into optimized sparse MMA kernels via layout search and table-driven memory mapping. Evaluated on 79 stencil kernels spanning diverse scientific domains, SparStencil achieves up to 7.1x speedup (3.1x on average) over state-of-the-art framework while reducing code complexity and matching or exceeding expert-tuned performance in both compute throughput and memory efficiency."

2506.2342,"Spinodoid architected materials have drawn significant attention due to their unique nature in stochasticity, aperiodicity, and bi-continuity. Compared to classic periodic truss-, beam- and plate-based lattice architectures, spinodoids are insensitive to manufacturing defects, scalable for high throughput production, functionally graded by tunable local properties, and material failure resistant due to low-curvature morphology. However, the design of spinodoids is often hindered by the curse of dimensionality with extremely large design space of spinodoid types, material density, orientation, continuity, and anisotropy. From a design optimization perspective, while genetic algorithms are often beyond the reach of computing capacity, gradient-based topology optimization is challenged by the intricate mathematical derivation of gradient fields with respect to various spinodoid parameters. To address such challenges, we propose a data-driven multiscale topology optimization framework. Our framework reformulates the design variables of spinodoid materials as the parameters of neural networks, enabling automated computation of topological gradients. Additionally, it incorporates a Gaussian Process surrogate for spinodoid constitutive models, eliminating the need for repeated computational homogenization and enhancing the scalability of multiscale topology optimization. Compared to 'black-box' deep learning approaches, the proposed framework provides clear physical insights into material distribution. It explicitly reveals why anisotropic spinodoids with tailored orientations are favored in certain regions, while isotropic spinodoids are more suitable elsewhere. This interpretability helps to bridge the gap between data-driven design with mechanistic understanding."
2506.23422,"Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs) made of soft constituents have emerged as promising material-structure systems in potential applications across many engineering disciplines, such as soft robots, actuators, energy harvesting, and tissue engineering. Designing such systems remains challenging due to their multiscale architectures, multiple material phases, and inherent material and geometric nonlinearities. The focus of this paper is to propose a general topology optimization framework that automates the design innovation of multiscale soft FGMs exhibiting nonlinear material behaviors under large deformations. Our proposed topology optimization framework integrates several key innovations: (1) a novel microstructure reconstruction algorithm that generates composite architecture materials from a reduced design space using physically interpretable parameters; (2) a new material homogenization approach that estimates effective properties by combining the stored energy functions of multiple soft constituents; (3) a neural network-based topology optimization that incorporates data-driven material surrogates to enable bottom-up, simultaneous optimization of material and structure; and (4) a generic nonlinear sensitivity analysis technique that computes design sensitivities numerically without requiring explicit gradient derivation. To enhance the convergence of the nonlinear equilibrium equations amid topology optimization, we introduce an energy interpolation scheme and employ a Newton-Raphson solver with adaptive step sizes and convergence criteria. Numerical experiments show that the proposed framework produces distinct topological designs, different from those obtained under linear elasticity, with spatially varying microstructures."
2507.00539,"This paper presents an innovative Reduced-Order Model (ROM) for merging experimental and simulation data using Data Assimilation (DA) to estimate the ""True"" state of a fluid dynamics system, leading to more accurate predictions. Our methodology introduces a novel approach implementing the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) within a reduced-dimensional framework, grounded in a robust theoretical foundation and applied to fluid dynamics. To address the substantial computational demands of DA, the proposed ROM employs low-resolution (LR) techniques to drastically reduce computational costs. This approach involves downsampling datasets for DA computations, followed by an advanced reconstruction technique based on low-cost Singular Value Decomposition (lcSVD). The lcSVD method, a key innovation in this paper, has never been applied to DA before and offers a highly efficient way to enhance resolution with minimal computational resources. Our results demonstrate significant reductions in both computation time and RAM usage through the LR techniques without compromising the accuracy of the estimations. For instance, in a turbulent test case, the LR approach with a compression rate of 15.9 can achieve a speed-up of 13.7 and a RAM compression of 90.9% while maintaining a low Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) of 2.6%, compared to 0.8% in the high-resolution (HR) reference. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of the EnKF in estimating and predicting the state of fluid flow systems based on limited observations and low-fidelity numerical data. This paper highlights the potential of the proposed DA method in fluid dynamics applications, particularly for improving computational efficiency in CFD and related fields. Its ability to balance accuracy with low computational and memory costs makes it suitable for large-scale and real-time applications, such as environmental monitoring or aerospace."

2507.01617,"An enhanced geometric algorithm for automated pore-by-pore contact angle measurement from micro-CT images, is presented that achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods through robust fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interface extrapolation. Using this high resolution data, we generate spatially distributed contact angle maps that reveal previously hidden wettability heterogeneity. Our analysis of mixed-wet systems demonstrates the severe limitations of averaged metrics: a sample with a mean contact angle of 64.7 degrees, conventionally classified as uniformly weakly water-wet, exhibits 40% of its pore space in the intermediate-wetting regime (70-110 degrees). This heterogeneity explains the presence of minimal surface interfaces and fundamentally different pore-filling mechanisms operating within the same sample. By providing open-source tools for spatially-resolved wettability characterization, this work enables more accurate predictions of multiphase flow behavior in heterogeneous porous materials, essential for optimizing subsurface energy storage and recovery processes."
2507.01706,"In this contribution, we address the estimation of the frequency-dependent elastic parameters of polymers in the ultrasound range, which is formulated as an inverse problem. This inverse problem is implemented as a nonlinear regression-type optimization problem, in which the simulation signals are fitted to the measurement signals. These signals consist of displacement responses in waveguides, focusing on hollow cylindrical geometries to enhance the simulation efficiency. To accelerate the optimization and reduce the number of model evaluations and wait times, we propose two novel methods. First, we introduce an adaptation of the Levenberg-Marquardt method derived from a geometrical interpretation of the least-squares optimization problem. Second, we introduce an improved objective function based on the autocorrelated envelopes of the measurement and simulation signals. Given that this study primarily relies on simulation data to quantify optimization convergence, we aggregate the expected ranges of realistic material parameters and derive their distributions to ensure the reproducibility of optimizations with proper measurements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our objective function modification and step adaptation for various materials with isotropic material symmetry by comparing them with a state-of-the-art optimization method. In all cases, our method reduces the total number of model evaluations, thereby shortening the time to identify the material parameters."
2507.02005,"This research introduces a unified approach combining Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to predict fatigue strength in welded transverse stiffener details. It integrates expert-driven feature engineering with algorithmic feature creation to enhance accuracy and explainability.Based on the extensive fatigue test database regression models - gradient boosting, random forests, and neural networks - were trained using AutoML under three feature schemes: domain-informed, algorithmic, and combined. This allowed a systematic comparison of expert-based versus automated feature selection.Ensemble methods (e.g. CatBoost, LightGBM) delivered top performance. The domain-informed model $\mathcal M_2$ achieved the best balance: test RMSE $\approx$ 30.6 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.780% over the full $\Delta \sigma_{c,50\%}$ range, and RMSE $\approx$ 13.4 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.527% within the engineering-relevant 0 - 150 MPa domain. The denser-feature model ($\mathcal M_3$) showed minor gains during training but poorer generalization, while the simpler base-feature model ($\mathcal M_1$) performed comparably, confirming the robustness of minimalist designs.XAI methods (SHAP and feature importance) identified stress ratio $R$, stress range $\Delta \sigma_i$, yield strength $R_{eH}$, and post-weld treatment (TIG dressing vs. as-welded) as dominant predictors. Secondary geometric factors - plate width, throat thickness, stiffener height - also significantly affected fatigue life.This framework demonstrates that integrating AutoML with XAI yields accurate, interpretable, and robust fatigue strength models for welded steel structures. It bridges data-driven modeling with engineering validation, enabling AI-assisted design and assessment. Future work will explore probabilistic fatigue life modeling and integration into digital twin environments."
2507.02436,"Advances in material functionalities drive innovations across various fields, where metamaterials-defined by structure rather than composition-are leading the way. Despite the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design strategies, their impact is limited by task-specific retraining, poor out-of-distribution(OOD) generalization, and the need for separate models for forward and inverse design. To address these limitations, we introduce the Metamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation model inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics of metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse, unseen combinations of material properties and structural responses. It also excels in nonlinear inverse design, even under OOD conditions. By treating metamaterials as an operator that maps material properties to structural responses, MetaFO uncovers intricate structure-property relationships and significantly expands the design space. This scalable and generalizable framework marks a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, paving the way for next-generation innovations."
2507.02524,"Accurately learning solution operators for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) from sparse and irregular data remains a challenging task. Recurrent DeepONet extensions inherit the discrete-time limitations of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) RNN architectures, while neural-ODE surrogates cannot incorporate new inputs after initialization. We introduce NCDE-DeepONet, a continuous-time operator network that embeds a Neural Controlled Differential Equation (NCDE) in the branch and augments the trunk with explicit space-time coordinates. The NCDE encodes an entire load history as the solution of a controlled ODE driven by a spline-interpolated input path, making the representation input-resolution-independent: it encodes different input signal discretizations of the observed samples. The trunk then probes this latent path at arbitrary spatial locations and times, rendering the overall map output-resolution independent: predictions can be queried on meshes and time steps unseen during training without retraining or interpolation. Benchmarks on transient Poisson, elastodynamic, and thermoelastic problems confirm the robustness and accuracy of the framework, achieving almost instant solution prediction. These findings suggest that controlled dynamics provide a principled and efficient foundation for high-fidelity operator learning in transient mechanics."
2507.02678,"Community currency networks are made up of individuals and or companies that share some physical or social characteristics and engage in economic transactions using a virtual currency. This paper investigates the structural and dynamic properties of such mutual credit systems through a case study of Sardex, a community currency initiated and mainly operating in Sardinia, Italy. The transaction network is modeled as a directed weighted graph and analyzed through a graph theoretic framework focused on the analysis of strongly connected components, condensed representations, and behavioral connectivity patterns. Emphasis is placed on understanding the evolution of the network's core and peripheral structures over a three year period, with attention to temporal contraction, flow asymmetries, and structural fragmentation depending on different user types. Our findings reveal persistent deviations from degree based null models and suggest the presence of behavioral imitation, specifically, a user preference for more active peers. We further assess the impact of heterogeneous connections between different type of users, which strengthen the network topology and enhance its resilience."
2507.0273,"The industrialization of catalytic processes hinges on the availability of reliable kinetic models for design, optimization, and control. Traditional mechanistic models demand extensive domain expertise, while many data-driven approaches often lack interpretability and fail to enforce physical consistency. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Physics-Informed Automated Discovery of Kinetics (PI-ADoK) framework. By integrating physical constraints directly into a symbolic regression approach, PI-ADoK narrows the search space and substantially reduces the number of experiments required for model convergence. Additionally, the framework incorporates a robust uncertainty quantification strategy via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which propagates parameter uncertainty to yield credible prediction intervals. Benchmarking our method against conventional approaches across several catalytic case studies demonstrates that PI-ADoK not only enhances model fidelity but also lowers the experimental burden, highlighting its potential for efficient and reliable kinetic model discovery in chemical reaction engineering."
2507.02887,"Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers are pivotal for sustainable hydrogen production, yet their long-term performance is hindered by membrane degradation, which poses reliability and safety challenges. Therefore, accurate modeling of this degradation is essential for optimizing durability and performance. To address these concerns, traditional physics-based models have been developed, offering interpretability but requiring numerous parameters that are often difficult to measure and calibrate. Conversely, data-driven approaches, such as machine learning, offer flexibility but may lack physical consistency and generalizability. To address these limitations, this study presents the first application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model membrane degradation in PEM electrolyzers. The proposed PINN framework couples two ordinary differential equations, one modeling membrane thinning via a first-order degradation law and another governing the time evolution of the cell voltage under membrane degradation. Results demonstrate that the PINN accurately captures the long-term system's degradation dynamics while preserving physical interpretability with limited noisy data. Consequently, this work introduces a novel hybrid modeling approach for estimating and understanding membrane degradation mechanisms in PEM electrolyzers, offering a foundation for more robust predictive tools in electrochemical system diagnostics."
2507.03087,"Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), characterized by neural network-encoded signed distance fields, provide a powerful means to represent complex geometries continuously and efficiently. While successful in computer vision and generative modeling, integrating INRs into computational analysis workflows, such as finite element simulations, remains underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a computational framework that seamlessly combines INRs with the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM) for high-fidelity linear elasticity simulations without explicit geometry transformations. By directly querying the neural implicit geometry, we obtain the surrogate boundaries and distance vectors essential for SBM, effectively eliminating the meshing step. We demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our approach through elasticity simulations on complex geometries (Stanford Bunny, Eiffel Tower, gyroids) sourced from triangle soups and point clouds. Our method showcases significant computational advantages and accuracy, underscoring its potential in biomedical, geophysical, and advanced manufacturing applications."
2507.03197,"CD8+ ""killer"" T cells and CD4+ ""helper"" T cells play a central role in the adaptive immune system by recognizing antigens presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) molecules via T Cell Receptors (TCRs). Modeling binding between T cells and the pMHC complex is fundamental to understanding basic mechanisms of human immune response as well as in developing therapies. While transformer-based models such as TULIP have achieved impressive performance in this domain, their black-box nature precludes interpretability and thus limits a deeper mechanistic understanding of T cell response. Most existing post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) methods are confined to encoder-only, co-attention, or model-specific architectures and cannot handle encoder-decoder transformers used in TCR-pMHC modeling. To address this gap, we propose Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction (QCAI), a new post-hoc method designed to interpret the cross-attention mechanisms in transformer decoders. Quantitative evaluation is a challenge for XAI methods; we have compiled TCR-XAI, a benchmark consisting of 274 experimentally determined TCR-pMHC structures to serve as ground truth for binding. Using these structures we compute physical distances between relevant amino acid residues in the TCR-pMHC interaction region and evaluate how well our method and others estimate the importance of residues in this region across the dataset. We show that QCAI achieves state-of-the-art performance on both interpretability and prediction accuracy under the TCR-XAI benchmark."

Comprehensive knowledge integration in Digital Twins requires the combination of heterogeneous models and a structured representation of model information. The proposed approach uses a standardized description of behavior models, semantic technologies and a graph-based model understanding to enable automatic adaption and selection of suitable models. It is implemented using a graph-based knowledge representation with Neo4j, automatic data extraction from Asset Administration Shells and port matching to ensure compatible model configurations."
2507.04682,"Stormwater infrastructures are decentralized urban water-management systems that face highly unsteady hydraulic and pollutant loadings from episodic rainfall-runoff events. Accurately evaluating their in-situ treatment performance is essential for cost-effective design and planning. Traditional lumped dynamic models (e.g., continuously stirred tank reactor, CSTR) are computationally efficient but oversimplify transport and reaction processes, limiting predictive accuracy and insight. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) resolves detailed turbulent transport and pollutant fate physics but incurs prohibitive computational cost for unsteady and long-term simulations. To address these limitations, this study develops a composite operator-based neural network (CPNN) framework that leverages state-of-the-art operator learning to predict the spatial and temporal dynamics of hydraulics and particulate matter (PM) in stormwater treatment. The framework is demonstrated on a hydrodynamic separator (HS), a common urban treatment device. Results indicate that the CPNN achieves R2 > 0.8 for hydraulic predictions in 95.2% of test cases; for PM concentration predictions, R2 > 0.8 in 72.6% of cases and 0.4 < R2 < 0.8 in 22.6%. The analysis identifies challenges in capturing dynamics under extreme low-flow conditions, owing to their lower contribution to the training loss. Exploiting the automatic-differentiation capability of the CPNN, sensitivity analyses quantify the influence of storm event loading on PM transport. Finally, the potential of the CPNN framework for continuous, long-term evaluation of stormwater infrastructure performance is discussed, marking a step toward robust, climate-aware planning and implementation."
2507.05503,"Structure-based drug design (SBDD) seeks to generate molecules that bind effectively to protein targets by leveraging their 3D structural information. While diffusion-based generative models have become the predominant approach for SBDD, alternative non-autoregressive frameworks remain relatively underexplored. In this work, we introduce MolFORM, a novel generative framework that jointly models discrete (atom types) and continuous (3D coordinates) molecular modalities using multi-flow matching. To further enhance generation quality, we incorporate a preference-guided fine-tuning stage based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), using Vina score as a reward signal.

2507.06133,"Video-diffusion models have recently set the standard in video generation, inpainting, and domain translation thanks to their training stability and high perceptual fidelity. Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional video diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a Sequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse, physics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions. The prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns only the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the S-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution to its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening high-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework is assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity flow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these data sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage counterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the flow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of 81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative errors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial details. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware prior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual learning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy, and (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow to nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural modifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear, time-dependent continua."
2507.06351,"Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) safety is crucial in traffic management and public safety. CMVs account for numerous traffic incidents, so monitoring CMV safety and safety inspections is essential for ensuring safe and efficient highway movement. This paper presents the development and real-world application of CMV dashboards designed under the guidance of CMV safety enforcement professionals from the Maryland State Police (MSP), the Maryland Department of Transportation - State Highway Administration (MDOT - SHA), and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to enable intuitive and efficient analysis of CMV safety performance measures. First, three CMV safety dashboards enable CMV safety professionals to identify sites with a history of safety performance issues. A supplemental dashboard automates the analysis of CMV enforcement initiatives using the same performance measures. These performance measures are based on CMV probe vehicle speeds, inspection/citation data from Truck Weigh and Inspection Stations (TWIS), patrolling enforcement, and Virtual Weigh Stations (VWS). The authors collaborated with MSP to identify a portion of I-81 in Maryland, susceptible to improvement from targeted CMV enforcement. The supplemental enforcement assessment dashboard was employed to evaluate the impact of enforcement, including the post-enforcement halo effect. The results of the post-enforcement evaluation were mixed, indicating a need for more fine-grained citation data."
2507.06444,"Accurate accident anticipation remains challenging when driver cognition and dynamic road conditions are underrepresented in predictive models. In this paper, we propose CAMERA (Context-Aware Multi-modal Enhanced Risk Anticipation), a multi-modal framework integrating dashcam video, textual annotations, and driver attention maps for robust accident anticipation. Unlike existing methods that rely on static or environment-centric thresholds, CAMERA employs an adaptive mechanism guided by scene complexity and gaze entropy, reducing false alarms while maintaining high recall in dynamic, multi-agent traffic scenarios. A hierarchical fusion pipeline with Bi-GRU (Bidirectional GRU) captures spatio-temporal dependencies, while a Geo-Context Vision-Language module translates 3D spatial relationships into interpretable, human-centric alerts.

We study an important generalization of the problem where the agent can either fully open boxes for a certain fee to reveal their exact values or partially open them at a reduced cost. This introduces a new tradeoff between information acquisition and cost efficiency. We establish a hardness result and employ an array of techniques in stochastic optimization to provide a comprehensive analysis of this model. This includes (1) the identification of structural properties of the optimal policy that provide insights about optimal decisions; (2) the derivation of problem relaxations and provably near-optimal solutions; (3) the characterization of the optimal policy in special yet non-trivial cases; and (4) an extensive numerical study that compares the performance of various policies, and which provides additional insights about the optimal policy.

2507.0783,"A model-order reduction framework for the meshless smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is presented. The proposed framework introduces the concept of modal reference spaces to overcome the challenges of discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic, and mixing numerical topology that occurs in SPH simulations. These reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the field equations while maintaining the inherent meshless qualities of SPH. Modal reference spaces are constructed by projecting snapshot data onto a reference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered via traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)). Modal quantities are mapped back to the meshless SPH space via scattered data interpolation during the online predictive stage. The proposed model-order reduction framework is cast into the meshless Galerkin POD and the Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin projection model-order reduction (PMOR) formulation. The PMORs are tested on three numerical experiments: 1) the Taylor--Green vortex; 2) the lid-driven cavity; and 3) the flow past an open cavity. Results show good agreement in reconstructed and predictive velocity fields, which showcase the ability of this framework to evolve the field equations in a low-dimensional subspace on an unstructured, dynamic, and mixing numerical topology. Results also show that the pressure field is sensitive to the projection error due to the stiff weakly-compressible assumption made in the current SPH framework, but this sensitivity can be alleviated through nonlinear approximations, such as the APG approach. The proposed meshless model-order reduction framework reports up to 90,000x dimensional compression within 10% error in quantities of interest, marking a step toward drastic cost reduction in SPH simulations."
2507.08184,"Graph neural networks have shown remarkable performance in forecasting stock movements, which arises from learning complex inter-dependencies between stocks and intra-dynamics of stocks. Existing approaches based on graph neural networks typically rely on static or manually defined factors to model changing inter-dependencies between stocks. Furthermore, these works often struggle to preserve hierarchical features within stocks. To bridge these gaps, this work presents the Energy-based Parallel Graph Attention Neural Network, a novel approach for predicting future movements for multiple stocks. First, it generates a dynamic stock graph with the energy difference between stocks and Boltzmann distribution, capturing evolving inter-dependencies between stocks. Then, a parallel graph attention mechanism is proposed to preserve the hierarchical intra-stock dynamics. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets are conducted to validate the proposed approach, spanning from the US stock markets (NASDAQ, NYSE, SP) and UK stock markets (FTSE, LSE).

2507.09435,"The material point method (MPM), a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian particle method, is increasingly used to simulate large-deformation and history-dependent behavior of geomaterials. While explicit time integration dominates current MPM implementations due to its algorithmic simplicity, such schemes are unsuitable for quasi-static and long-term processes typical in geomechanics. Implicit MPM formulations are free of these limitations but remain less adopted, largely due to the difficulty of computing the Jacobian matrix required for Newton-type solvers, especially when consistent tangent operators should be derived for complex constitutive models. In this paper, we introduce GeoWarp -- an implicit MPM framework for geomechanics built on NVIDIA Warp -- that exploits GPU parallelism and reverse-mode automatic differentiation to compute Jacobians without manual derivation. To enhance efficiency, we develop a sparse Jacobian construction algorithm that leverages the localized particle-grid interactions intrinsic to MPM. The framework is verified through forward and inverse examples in large-deformation elastoplasticity and coupled poromechanics. Results demonstrate that GeoWarp provides a robust, scalable, and extensible platform for differentiable implicit MPM simulation in computational geomechanics."
2507.09527,"With the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), accurate charging demand and station occupancy forecasting are critical for optimizing urban energy and the profit of EVs aggregator. Existing approaches in this field usually struggle to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in EV charging behaviors, and their limited model parameters hinder their ability to learn complex data distribution representations from large datasets. To this end, we propose a novel EV spatio-temporal large language model (EV-STLLM) for accurate prediction. Our proposed framework is divided into two modules. In the data processing module, we utilize variational mode decomposition (VMD) for data denoising, and improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) for data multi-frequency decomposition. Fuzzy information granulation (FIG) for extracting multi-scale information. Additionally, ReliefF is used for feature selection to mitigate redundancy. In the forecasting module, the EV-STLLM is used to directly achieve EV charging and occupancy forecasting. Firstly, we fully capture the intrinsic spatio-temporal characteristics of the data by integrating adjacency matrices derived from the regional stations network and spatio-temporal-frequency embedding information. Then, the partially frozen graph attention (PFGA) module is utilized to maintain the sequential feature modeling capabilities of the pre-trained large model while incorporating EV domain knowledge. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Shenzhen, China, demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve superior accuracy and robustness compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks."
2507.09591,"Wire-arc directed energy deposition (DED) has emerged as a promising additive manufacturing (AM) technology for large-scale structural engineering applications. However, the complex thermal dynamics inherent to the process present challenges in ensuring structural integrity and mechanical properties of fabricated thick walls and plates. While finite element method (FEM) simulations have been conventionally employed to predict thermal history during deposition, their computational demand remains prohibitively high for actual large-scale applications. Given the necessity of multiple repetitive simulations for heat management and the determination of an optimal printing strategy, FEM simulation quickly becomes entirely infeasible. Instead, advancements have been made in using trained neural networks as surrogate models for rapid prediction. However, traditional data-driven approaches necessitate large amounts of relevant and verifiable external data, during the training and validation of the neural network. Regarding large-scale wire-arc DED, none of these data sources are readily available in quantities sufficient for an accurate surrogate. The introduction of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has opened up an alternative simulation strategy by leveraging the existing physical knowledge of the phenomena with advanced machine learning methods. Despite their theoretical advantages, PINNs have seen limited application in the context of large-scale wire-arc DED for structural engineering. This study investigates the scalability of PINNs, focusing on efficient collocation points sampling, a critical factor controlling both the training time and model performance. Results show PINNs can reduce computational time and effort by up to 98.6%, while maintaining the desired accuracy and offering ""super-resolution"". Future directions for enhancing PINN performance in metal AM are discussed."
2507.09675,"Background: Predicting startup success with machine learning is a rapidly growing field, yet findings on key predictors are often fragmented and context-specific. This makes it difficult to discern robust patterns and highlights a need for a systematic synthesis of the evidence.Methods: This study conducts a quantitative meta-analysis to synthesize the literature on predictor importance in AI-based startup evaluation. We performed a systematic review to identify a final sample of 13 empirical studies that report rankable feature importance. From these papers, we extracted and categorized 58 unique predictors, synthesizing their importance using a Weighted Importance Score (WIS) that balances a feature's average rank with its frequency of appearance. We also conducted a moderator analysis to investigate how predictor importance changes with context (e.g., success definition).Results: Our aggregate analysis reveals that the most consistently powerful predictors are a quartet of foundational attributes: Firm Characteristics (e.g., age, location), Investor Structure (e.g., investor quality), Digital and Social Traction (e.g., online momentum), and Funding History. The moderator analysis further reveals that this hierarchy is highly context-dependent. For instance, predicting near-term funding milestones elevates the importance of the deal's immediate context, while predicting long-term exits prioritizes fundamental firm and investor characteristics.Conclusion: The factors that best predict startup success are not universal but are contingent on the startup's goals, stage, and the data used for evaluation. Our findings point to a potential ""convenience bias"" in the literature, where predictor importance may be tied to data accessibility. We conclude by underscoring the need for standardized reporting practices to enable more robust, cumulative knowledge building in the field."
2507.09825,"This paper makes two main contributions. First, we present a pedagogical review of the derivation of the three-term recurrence relation for Legendre polynomials, without relying on the classical Legendre differential equation, Rodrigues' formula, or generating functions. This exposition is designed to be accessible to undergraduate students.Second, we develop a computational framework for Karhunen-Loève expansions of isotropic Gaussian random fields on hyper-rectangular domains. The framework leverages Legendre polynomials and their associated Gaussian quadrature, and it remains efficient even in higher spatial dimensions.A covariance kernel is first approximated by a non-negative mixture of squared-exponentials, obtained via a Newton-optimized fit with a theoretically informed initialization. The resulting separable kernel enables a Legendre-Galerkin discretization in the form of a Kronecker product over single dimensions, with submatrices that exhibit even/odd parity structure. For assembly, we introduce a Duffy-type transformation followed by quadrature. These structural properties significantly reduce both memory usage and arithmetic cost compared to naive approaches. All algorithms and numerical experiments are provided in an open-source repository that reproduces every figure and table in this work."
2507.10196,"Automated material model discovery disrupts the tedious and time-consuming cycle of iteratively calibrating and modifying manually designed models. Non-smooth L1-norm regularization is the backbone of automated model discovery; however, the current literature on automated material model discovery offers limited insights into the robust and efficient minimization of non-smooth objective functions. In this work, we examine the minimization of functions of the form f(w) + a ||w||_1, where w are the material model parameters, f is a metric that quantifies the mismatch between the material model and the observed data, and a is a regularization parameter that determines the sparsity of the solution. We investigate both the straightforward case where f is quadratic and the more complex scenario where it is non-quadratic or even non-convex. Importantly, we do not only focus on methods that solve the sparse regression problem for a given value of the regularization parameter a, but propose methods to efficiently compute the entire regularization path, facilitating the selection of a suitable a. Specifically, we present four algorithms and discuss their roles for automated material model discovery in mechanics: First, we recapitulate a well-known coordinate descent algorithm that solves the minimization problem assuming that f is quadratic for a given value of a, also known as the LASSO. Second, we discuss the algorithm LARS, which automatically determines the critical values of a, at which material parameters in w are set to zero. Third, we propose to use the proximal gradient method ISTA for automated material model discovery if f is not quadratic, and fourth, we suggest a pathwise extension of ISTA for computing the regularization path. We demonstrate the applicability of all algorithms for the discovery of hyperelastic material models from uniaxial tension and simple shear data."
2507.10448,"Financial report generation tasks range from macro- to micro-economics analysis, also requiring extensive data analysis. Existing LLM models are usually fine-tuned on simple QA tasks and cannot comprehensively analyze real financial scenarios. Given the complexity, financial companies often distribute tasks among departments. Inspired by this, we propose FinTeam, a financial multi-agent collaborative system, with a workflow with four LLM agents: document analyzer, analyst, accountant, and consultant. We train these agents with specific financial expertise using constructed datasets. We evaluate FinTeam on comprehensive financial tasks constructed from real online investment forums, including macroeconomic, industry, and company analysis. The human evaluation shows that by combining agents, the financial reports generate from FinTeam achieved a 62.00% acceptance rate, outperforming baseline models like GPT-4o and Xuanyuan. Additionally, FinTeam's agents demonstrate a 7.43% average improvement on FinCUGE and a 2.06% accuracy boost on FinEval. Project is available atthis https URL."
2507.10553,"A three-dimensional SPH computational framework is presented for modeling fluid-structure interactions with structural deformation and failure. We combine weakly compressible SPH with a pseudo-spring-based SPH solver to capture the fluid flow and deformable structures. A unified modeling approach captures the solid boundaries and fluid-structure interfaces without penalty-based contact force. The $\delta$-SPH technique improves the pressure calculations in the fluid phase, while structural damage is modeled using a pseudo-spring approach, with particle interactions limited to its neighbors. The present framework can capture the three-dimensional crack surfaces in structures without any computationally intensive crack-tracking algorithm or visibility criteria. The framework has been proven effective against existing models and experimental data, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness in simulating detailed fracture patterns and offering insights into the impact of hydrodynamic events on structural integrity."
2507.11172,"Understanding the complex behavior of molecular systems is fundamental to fields such as physics, materials science, and biology. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are crucial tools for studying atomic-level dynamics. This work focuses on improving the efficiency of MD simulations involving two-body and three-body interactions. Traditional two-body potentials often can not fully capture the complexity of molecular systems, making the inclusion of three-body interactions important. However, these interactions are in a cubic complexity class, compared to a quadratic one for two-body interactions, and therefore are computationally expensive, even when a cutoff distance is applied. One way to improve efficiency is to use the r-RESPA multiple time-stepping algorithm to reduce the number of three-body interaction calculations. In this work, we investigate this method in the context of High Performance Computing (HPC) methods that parallelize the calculations. In particular, we investigate a communication-reducing distributed-memory parallel method from literature and present a novel shared-memory parallel cutoff method, implemented in the particle simulation library AutoPas. The results and methods are discussed, providing insights into potential advancements in MD simulation efficiency."
2507.11191,"The optimization of industrial processes remains a critical challenge, particularly when no mathematical formulation of objective functions or constraints is available. This study addresses this issue by proposing a surrogate-based, data-driven methodology for optimizing complex real-world manufacturing systems using only historical process data. Machine learning models are employed to approximate system behavior and construct surrogate models, which are integrated into a tailored metaheuristic approach: Data-Driven Differential Evolution with Multi-Level Penalty Functions and Surrogate Models, an adapted version of Differential Evolution suited to the characteristics of the studied process. The methodology is applied to an extrusion process in the tire manufacturing industry, with the goal of optimizing initialization parameters to reduce waste and production time. Results show that the surrogate-based optimization approach outperforms historical best configurations, achieving a 65\% reduction in initialization and setup time, while also significantly minimizing material waste. These findings highlight the potential of combining data-driven modeling and metaheuristic optimization for industrial processes where explicit formulations are unavailable."
2507.1164,"Stirred tanks are vital in chemical and biotechnological processes, particularly as bioreactors. Although computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is widely used to model the flow in stirred tanks, its high computational cost$-$especially in multi-query scenarios for process design and optimization$-$drives the need for efficient data-driven surrogate models. However, acquiring sufficiently large datasets can be costly. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a promising solution to reduce data requirements while maintaining accuracy by embedding underlying physics into neural network (NN) training. This study quantifies the data requirements of vanilla PINNs for developing surrogate models of a flow field in a 2D stirred tank. We compare these requirements with classical supervised neural networks and boundary-informed neural networks (BINNs). Our findings demonstrate that surrogate models can achieve prediction errors around 3% across Reynolds numbers from 50 to 5000 using as few as six datapoints. Moreover, employing an approximation of the velocity profile in place of real data labels leads to prediction errors of around 2.5%. These results indicate that even with limited or approximate datasets, PINNs can be effectively trained to deliver high accuracy comparable to high-fidelity data."
2507.1187,"We introduce a novel Multimodal Neural Operator (MNO) architecture designed to learn solution operators for multi-parameter nonlinear boundary value problems (BVPs). Traditional neural operators primarily map either the PDE coefficients or source terms independently to the solution, limiting their flexibility and applicability. In contrast, our proposed MNO architecture generalizes these approaches by mapping multiple parameters including PDE coefficients, source terms, and boundary conditions to the solution space in a unified manner. Our MNO is motivated by the hierarchical nested bases of the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) and is constructed systematically through three key components: a parameter efficient Generalized FMM (GFMM) block, a Unimodal Neural Operator (UNO) built upon GFMM blocks for single parameter mappings, and most importantly, a multimodal fusion mechanism extending these components to learn the joint map. We demonstrate the multimodal generalization capacity of our approach on both linear and nonlinear BVPs. Our experiments show that the network effectively handles simultaneous variations in PDE coefficients and source or boundary terms."
2507.12233,"Solving cell problems in homogenization is hard, and available deep-learning frameworks fail to match the speed and generality of traditional computational frameworks. More to the point, it is generally unclear what to expect of machine-learning approaches, let alone single out which approaches are promising. In the work at hand, we advocate Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for micromechanics, empowering them by insights from computational micromechanics methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We construct an FNO surrogate mimicking the basic scheme foundational for FFT-based methods and show that the resulting operator predicts solutions to cell problems with arbitrary stiffness distribution only subject to a material-contrast constraint up to a desired accuracy. In particular, there are no restrictions on the material symmetry like isotropy, on the number of phases and on the geometry of the interfaces between materials. Also, the provided fidelity is sharp and uniform, providing explicit guarantees leveraging our physical empowerment of FNOs. To show the desired universal approximation property, we construct an FNO explicitly that requires no training to begin with. Still, the obtained neural operator complies with the same memory requirements as the basic scheme and comes with runtimes proportional to classical FFT solvers. In particular, large-scale problems with more than 100 million voxels are readily handled. The goal of this work is to underline the potential of FNOs for solving micromechanical problems, linking FFT-based methods to FNOs. This connection is expected to provide a fruitful exchange between both worlds."
2507.12557,"Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is an additive manufacturing technique that has gained popularity thanks to its ability to produce geometrically complex, fully dense metal parts. However, these parts are prone to internal defects and geometric inaccuracies, stemming in part from variations in the melt pool. This paper proposes a novel vector-level feedforward control framework for regulating melt pool area in LPBF. By decoupling part-scale thermal behavior from small-scale melt pool physics, the controller provides a scale-agnostic prediction of melt pool area and efficient optimization over it. This is done by operating on two coupled lightweight models: a finite-difference thermal model that efficiently captures vector-level temperature fields and a reduced-order, analytical melt pool model. Each model is calibrated separately with minimal single-track and 2D experiments, and the framework is validated on a complex 3D geometry in both Inconel 718 and 316L stainless steel. Results showed that feedforward vector-level laser power scheduling reduced geometric inaccuracy in key dimensions by 62%, overall porosity by 16.5%, and photodiode variation by 6.8% on average. Overall, this modular, data-efficient approach demonstrates that proactively compensating for known thermal effects can significantly improve part quality while remaining computationally efficient and readily extensible to other materials and machines."
2507.12745,"With the growing demand for renewable energy, countries are accelerating the construction of photovoltaic (PV) power stations. However, accurately forecasting power data for newly constructed PV stations is extremely challenging due to limited data availability. To this end, we propose a novel interpretable dynamic selection network (IDS-Net) based on feature information fusion to achieve accurate few-shot prediction. This transfer learning framework primarily consists of two parts. In the first stage, we pre-train on the large dataset, utilizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to select the source domain dataset most similar to the target domain data distribution. Subsequently, the ReliefF algorithm is utilized for feature selection, reducing the influence of feature redundancy. Then, the Hampel Identifier (HI) is used for training dataset outlier correction. In the IDS-Net model, we first obtain the initial extracted features from a pool of predictive models. Following this, two separate weighting channels are utilized to determine the interpretable weights for each sub-model and the adaptive selection outcomes, respectively. Subsequently, the extracted feature results from each sub-model are multiplied by their corresponding weights and then summed to obtain the weighted extracted features. Then, we perform cross-embedding on the additional features and fuse them with the extracted weighted features. This fused information is then passed through the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) layer to obtain predictions. In the second stage, we design an end-to-end adaptive transfer learning strategy to obtain the final prediction results on the target dataset. We validate the transfer learning process using two PV power datasets from Hebei province, China, to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework and transfer learning strategy."
2507.12835,"Financial trading environments are characterized by high volatility, numerous macroeconomic signals, and dynamically shifting market regimes, where traditional reinforcement learning methods often fail to deliver breakthrough performance. In this study, we design a reinforcement learning framework tailored for financial systems by integrating quantum circuits. We compare (1) the performance of classical A3C versus quantum A3C algorithms, and (2) the impact of incorporating LSTM-based predictions of the following week's economic trends on learning outcomes. The experimental framework adopts a custom Gymnasium-compatible trading environment, simulating discrete trading actions and evaluating rewards based on portfolio feedback. Experimental results show that quantum models - especially when combined with predictive signals - demonstrate superior performance and stability under noisy financial conditions, even with shallow quantum circuit depth."
2507.12901,"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general reasoning capabilities, holding significant potential for applications in the financial domain, a field that requires robust and reliable reasoning. It has been demonstrated that distilling high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales from advanced general reasoning models offers a promising and efficient path to the financial reasoning model. However, existing CoT synthesis methods suffer from shallow CoT sampling, leaving the question of how to construct a well-designed knowledge space for finance reasoning unexplored. In this paper, we present Agentar-DeepFinance-100K, a large-scale financial reasoning dataset characterized by its systematic CoT synthesis optimization. We first introduce a comprehensive CoT synthesis pipeline featuring Multi-perspective Knowledge Extraction (MKE) and Self-Corrective Rewriting (SCR) to generate exhaustive and deep financial reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, a systematic investigation, termed CoT Cube, is conducted to analyze critical factors that influence CoT effectiveness, such as necessity, length and synthesizer, yielding valuable insights for high-quality financial CoT construction. Experiments demonstrate that models trained on our Agentar-DeepFinance-100K achieve significant improvements on financial benchmarks. We publicly release Agentar-DeepFinance-100K , hoping to advance the research in financial reasoning models."
2507.13055,"This study investigates the extent to which local public equity indices can statistically hedge real purchasing power loss during compounded structural macro-financial collapses in emerging markets. We employ a non-linear multiplicative real return calculations consistent with Fisher-parity logics for both domestic and foreign investors with a principled quantile regression, tail dependence copula analysis, and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to assess the explanatory power of macro variables. The analysis focuses on three recent and data-accessible exemplary collapse episodes: Turkey (2018), Nigeria (2020), and Pakistan (2021). Such cases, selected to align with post-2018 improvements in data standardization and crisis comparability, span varied monetary regimes and crisis triggers. Our tail-focused modeling reveals a systematic breakdown in public-equity-based purchasing power protection precisely during simultaneous macroeconomic and monetary dislocations when such protection is most needed. The findings call into question conventional inflation and devaluation hedge presumptions in equity pricing theory, emphasizing the limitations of equity-based protection and the need for context-sensitive strategies during compounded macro-financial distress."
2507.13459,"Surrogate models for the rapid inference of nonlinear boundary value problems in mechanics are helpful in a broad range of engineering applications. However, effective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of deformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an open issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact or, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact planes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that serve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions for detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture that utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time, incorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable bodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft tissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic valve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the loss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits hold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and complex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also demonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries. However, such benefits come with high computational costs during training, resulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the training cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware architectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in up to a thousand-fold speedup for our benchmark problems at inference."
2507.14542,"High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial Electroencephalography (iEEG) are critical biomarkers for localizing the epileptogenic zone in epilepsy treatment. However, traditional rule-based detectors for HFOs suffer from unsatisfactory precision, producing false positives that require time-consuming manual review. Supervised machine learning approaches have been used to classify the detection results, yet they typically depend on labeled datasets, which are difficult to acquire due to the need for specialized expertise. Moreover, accurate labeling of HFOs is challenging due to low inter-rater reliability and inconsistent annotation practices across institutions. The lack of a clear consensus on what constitutes a pathological HFO further challenges supervised refinement approaches. To address this, we leverage the insight that legacy detectors reliably capture clinically relevant signals despite their relatively high false positive rates. We thus propose the Self-Supervised to Label Discovery (SS2LD) framework to refine the large set of candidate events generated by legacy detectors into a precise set of pathological HFOs. SS2LD employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) for morphological pre-training to learn meaningful latent representation of the detected events. These representations are clustered to derive weak supervision for pathological events. A classifier then uses this supervision to refine detection boundaries, trained on real and VAE-augmented data. Evaluated on large multi-institutional interictal iEEG datasets, SS2LD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. SS2LD offers a scalable, label-efficient, and clinically effective strategy to identify pathological HFOs using legacy detectors."
2507.15026,"Condition and structural health monitoring (CM/SHM) is a pivotal component of predictive maintenance (PdM) strategies across diverse industrial sectors, including mechanical rotating machinery, airplane composite wings, offshore wind turbines, and civil engineering structures. Conventional deep learning models, while effective in fault diagnosis and anomaly detection through supervised feature extraction and rule-based data augmentation, often struggle with operational variability, imbalanced or scarce fault datasets, and multimodal sensory data from complex systems. Deep generative models (DGMs) in this regard, including autoregressive models, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, diffusion-based models, and emerging large language models, offer transformative capabilities by synthesizing high-fidelity data samples, reconstructing latent system states, and modeling complex multimodal data streams. This review systematically examines state-of-the-art DGM applications in CM/SHM systems, emphasizing their role in addressing key challenges: data imbalance and imputation, domain adaptation and generalization, multimodal data fusion, and downstream fault diagnosis and anomaly detection tasks, with rigorous comparison among signal processing, conventional machine learning or deep learning models, and DGMs. We also analyze current limitations of DGMs, including challenges of explainable and trustworthy models, computational inefficiencies for edge deployment, and the need for parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. Future research directions can focus on zero-shot and few-shot learning, robust multimodal generalization, hybrid architectures integrating DGMs with physics knowledge, and reinforcement learning with DGMs to enhance robustness and accuracy in industrial scenarios."
2507.1557,"The iterative nature of topology optimization, especially in combination with nonlinear state problems, often requires the solution of thousands of linear equation systems. Furthermore, due to the pixelated design representation, the use of a fine mesh is essential to obtain geometrically well-defined structures and to accurately compute response quantities such as the von Mises stress. Therefore, the computational cost of solving a fine-mesh topology optimization problem quickly adds up. To address this challenge, we consider a multi-level adaptive refinement and coarsening strategy based on configurational forces. Configurational forces based on the Eshelby stress predict configurational changes such as crack propagation or dislocation motion. Due to a relaxation in the calculation of (Eshelby) stresses with respect to the design variables, discrete configurational forces increase not only in highly stressed regions, but also in grey transition regions (design boundaries). For this reason they are an ideal criterion for mesh adaptivity in topology optimization, especially when avoiding stress failure is a priority. By using configurational forces for refinement, we obtain a high-resolution structure where the refined mesh is present along the design boundaries as well as in stress-critical regions. At the same time, multilevel coarsening using the same criterion drastically minimizes the computational effort."
2507.15753,"Generative machine learning models have revolutionized material discovery by capturing complex structure-property relationships, yet extending these approaches to the inverse design of three-dimensional metamaterials remains limited by computational complexity and underexplored design spaces due to the lack of expressive representations. Here, we present DiffuMeta, a generative framework integrating diffusion transformers with a novel algebraic language representation, encoding 3D geometries as mathematical sentences. This compact, unified parameterization spans diverse topologies while enabling direct application of transformers to structural design. DiffuMeta leverages diffusion models to generate novel shell structures with precisely targeted stress-strain responses under large deformations, accounting for buckling and contact while addressing the inherent one-to-many mapping by producing diverse solutions. Uniquely, our approach enables simultaneous control over multiple mechanical objectives, including linear and nonlinear responses beyond training domains. Experimental validation of fabricated structures further confirms the efficacy of our approach for accelerated design of metamaterials and structures with tailored properties."
2507.15787,"Although many problems in science and engineering are modelled by well-established PDEs, they often involve unknown or incomplete relationships, such as material constitutive laws or thermal response, that limit accuracy and generality. Existing surrogate-modelling approaches directly approximate PDE solutions but remain tied to a specific geometry, boundary conditions, and set of physical constraints. To address these limitations, we introduce a fully differentiable finite element-based machine learning (FEBML) framework that embeds trainable operators for unknown physics within a state-of-the-art, general FEM solver, enabling true end-to-end differentiation. At its core, FEBML represents each unknown operator as an encode-process-decode pipeline over finite-element degrees of freedom: field values are projected to nodal coefficients, transformed by a neural network, and then lifted back to a continuous FE function, ensuring the learned physics respects the variational structure. We demonstrate its versatility by recovering nonlinear stress-strain laws from laboratory tests, applying the learned model to a new mechanical scenario without retraining, and identifying temperature-dependent conductivity in transient heat flow."
2507.16069,"Learning-based surrogate models have become a practical alternative to high-fidelity CFD solvers, but their latent representations remain opaque and hinder adoption in safety-critical or regulation-bound settings. This work introduces a posthoc interpretability framework for graph-based surrogate models used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) by leveraging sparse autoencoders (SAEs). By obtaining an overcomplete basis in the node embedding space of a pretrained surrogate, the method extracts a dictionary of interpretable latent features. The approach enables the identification of monosemantic concepts aligned with physical phenomena such as vorticity or flow structures, offering a model-agnostic pathway to enhance explainability and trustworthiness in CFD applications."
2507.1647,"Effective disease treatment often requires precise control of the release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). In this work, we present a computational inverse design approach to determine the optimal drug composition that yields a target release profile. We assume that the drug release is governed by the Noyes-Whitney model, meaning that dissolution occurs at the surface of the drug. Our inverse design method is based on topology optimization. The method optimizes the drug composition based on the target release profile, considering the drug material parameters and the shape of the final drug. Our method is non-parametric and applicable to arbitrary drug shapes. The inverse design method is complemented by robust topology optimization, which accounts for the random drug material parameters. We use the stochastic reduced-order method (SROM) to propagate the uncertainty in the dissolution model. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, SROM requires fewer samples and improves computational performance. We apply our method to designing drugs with several target release profiles. The numerical results indicate that the release profiles of the designed drugs closely resemble the target profiles. The SROM-based drug designs exhibit less uncertainty in their release profiles, suggesting that our method is a convincing approach for uncertainty-aware drug design."
2507.16717,"Traditional approaches to portfolio optimization, often rooted in Modern Portfolio Theory and solved via quadratic programming or evolutionary algorithms, struggle with scalability or flexibility, especially in scenarios involving complex constraints, large datasets and/or multiple conflicting objectives. To address these challenges, we introduce a benchmark framework for multi-objective portfolio optimization (MPO) using gradient descent with automatic differentiation. Our method supports any optimization objective, such as minimizing risk measures (e.g., CVaR) or maximizing Sharpe ratio, along with realistic constraints, such as tracking error limits, UCITS regulations, or asset group restrictions. We have evaluated our framework across six experimental scenarios, from single-objective setups to complex multi-objective cases, and have compared its performance against standard solvers like CVXPY and SKFOLIO.

We aim to provide a practical and extensible tool for researchers and practitioners exploring advanced portfolio optimization problems in real-world conditions."
2507.17353,"Accurate road damage detection is crucial for timely infrastructure maintenance and public safety, but existing vision-only datasets and models lack the rich contextual understanding that textual information can provide. To address this limitation, we introduce RoadBench, the first multimodal benchmark for comprehensive road damage understanding. This dataset pairs high resolution images of road damages with detailed textual descriptions, providing a richer context for model training. We also present RoadCLIP, a novel vision language model that builds upon CLIP by integrating domain specific enhancements. It includes a disease aware positional encoding that captures spatial patterns of road defects and a mechanism for injecting road-condition priors to refine the model's understanding of road damages. We further employ a GPT driven data generation pipeline to expand the image to text pairs in RoadBench, greatly increasing data diversity without exhaustive manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that RoadCLIP achieves state of the art performance on road damage recognition tasks, significantly outperforming existing vision-only models by 19.2%. These results highlight the advantages of integrating visual and textual information for enhanced road condition analysis, setting new benchmarks for the field and paving the way for more effective infrastructure monitoring through multimodal learning."
2507.17448,"Retrosynthesis planning, essential in organic synthesis and drug discovery, has greatly benefited from recent AI-driven advancements. Nevertheless, existing methods frequently face limitations in both applicability and explainability. Traditional graph-based and sequence-to-sequence models often lack generalized chemical knowledge, leading to predictions that are neither consistently accurate nor easily explainable. To address these challenges, we introduce RetroDFM-R, a reasoning-based large language model (LLM) designed specifically for chemical retrosynthesis. Leveraging large-scale reinforcement learning guided by chemically verifiable rewards, RetroDFM-R significantly enhances prediction accuracy and explainability. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that RetroDFM-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a top-1 accuracy of 65.0% on the USPTO-50K benchmark. Double-blind human assessments further validate the chemical plausibility and practical utility of RetroDFM-R's predictions. RetroDFM-R also accurately predicts multistep retrosynthetic routes reported in the literature for both real-world drug molecules and perovskite materials. Crucially, the model's explicit reasoning process provides human-interpretable insights, thereby enhancing trust and practical value in real-world retrosynthesis applications."
2507.17723,"Eliminating warpage in injection molded polymeric parts is one of the most important problems in the injection molding industry today. This situation is critical in geometries that are particularly susceptible to warping due to their geometric features, and this occurs with topologies of great length and slenderness with high changes in thickness. These features are, in these special geometries, impossible to manufacture with traditional technologies to meet the dimensional and sustainable requirements of the industry. This paper presents an innovative green conformal cooling system that is specifically designed for parts with slender geometric shapes that are highly susceptible to warping. Additionally, the work presented by the authors investigates the importance of using highly conductive inserts made of steel alloys in combination with the use of additively manufactured conformal channels for reducing influential parameters, such as warpage, cooling time, and residual stresses in the complex manufacturing of long and slender parts. The results of this real industrial case study indicated that the use of conformal cooling layouts decreased the cycle time by 175.1 s 66% below the current cooling time; the temperature gradient by 78.5% specifically, 18.16 C; the residual stress by 39.78 MPa or 81.88%; and the warpage by 6.9 mm or 90.5%. In this way, it was possible to achieve a final warping in the complex geometry studied of 0.72 mm, which was under the maximum value required at the industrial level of 1 mm. The resulting values obtained by the researchers present a turning point from which the manufacturing and sustainability in the injection molding of said plastic geometries is possible, and they take into account that the geometric manufacturing features analyzed will present a great demand in the coming years in the auto parts manufacturing industry."
2507.18449,"The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence has catalyzed the evolution of Digital Twins (DTs) from conceptual ideas to more implementable realities. Yet, transitioning from academia to industry is complex due to the absence of standardized frameworks. This paper builds upon the authors' previously established functional and informational requirements supporting standardized DT development, focusing on a crucial aspect: transferability. While existing DT research primarily centers on asset transfer, the significance of ""sim-to-real transfer"" and ""real-to-sim transfer""--transferring knowledge between simulations and real-world operations--is vital for comprehensive lifecycle management in DTs. A key challenge in this process is calibrating the ""reality gap,"" the discrepancy between simulated predictions and actual outcomes. Our research investigates the impact of integrating a single Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an existing DT framework to effectively manage both sim-to-real and real-to-sim transfers. This integration is facilitated by data pipelines that connect the RGA module with the existing components of the DT framework, including the historical repository and the simulation model. A case study on a pedestrian bridge at Carnegie Mellon University showcases the performance of different levels of integration of our approach with an existing framework. With full implementation of an RGA module and a complete data pipeline, our approach is capable of bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world operations without compromising efficiency."
2507.18636,"In-service structural health monitoring is a so far rarely exploited, yet potent option for early-stage crack detection and identification in train wheelset axles. This procedure is non-trivial to enforce on the basis of a purely data-driven approach and typically requires the adoption of numerical, e.g. finite element-based, simulation schemes of the dynamic behavior of these axles. Damage in this particular case can be formulated as a breathing crack problem, which further complicates simulation by introducing response-dependent nonlinearities into the picture. In this study, first, a new crack detection feature based on higher-order harmonics of the breathing crack is proposed, termed Higher-Order Transmissibility (HOTr), and, secondly, its sensitivity and efficacy are assessed within the context of crack identification. Next, the mentioned feature is approximated via use of linear system theory, delivering a surrogate model which facilitates the computation and speeds up the crack identification procedure. The accuracy of the proposed method in reproducing the delivered HOTr is compared against the nonlinear simulation model. The obtained results suggest that the approximation of the HOTr can significantly reduce the computational burden by eliminating the need for an iterative solution of the governing nonlinear equation of motion, while maintaining a high level of accuracy when compared against the reference model. This implies great potential for adoption in in-service damage identification for wheelset axles, feasibly within a near real-time context."
2507.18731,"Phase-field equations, mostly solved numerically, are known for capturing the mesoscale microstructural evolution of a material. However, such numerical solvers are computationally expensive as it needs to generate fine mesh systems to solve the complex Partial Differential Equations(PDEs) with good accuracy. Therefore, we propose an alternative approach of predicting the microstructural evolution subjected to periodic boundary conditions using Physics informed Neural Operators (PINOs).In this study, we have demonstrated the capability of PINO to predict the growth of $\theta^{\prime}$ precipitates in Al-Cu alloys by learning the operator as well as by solving three coupled physics equations simultaneously. The coupling is of two second-order Allen-Cahn equation and one fourth-order Cahn-Hilliard equation. We also found that using Fourier derivatives(pseudo-spectral method and Fourier extension) instead of Finite Difference Method improved the Cahn-Hilliard equation loss by twelve orders of magnitude. Moreover, since differentiation is equivalent to multiplication in the Fourier domain, unlike Physics informed Neural Networks(PINNs), we can easily compute the fourth derivative of Cahn-Hilliard equation without converting it to coupled second order derivative."
2507.18816,"Designing mutations to optimize protein thermostability remains challenging due to the complex relationship between sequence variations, structural dynamics, and thermostability, often assessed by \delta\delta G(the change in free energy of unfolding). Existing methods rely on experimental random mutagenesis or prediction models tested with pre-defined datasets, using sequence-based heuristics and treating enzyme design as a one-step process without iterative refinement, which limits design space exploration and restricts discoveries beyond known variations. We present ThermoRL, a framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages graph neural networks (GNN) to design mutations with enhanced thermostability. It combines a pre-trained GNN-based encoder with a hierarchical Q-learning network and employs a surrogate model for reward feedback, guiding the RL agent on where (the position) and which (mutant amino acid) to apply for enhanced thermostability. Experimental results show that ThermoRL achieves higher or comparable rewards than baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. It filters out destabilizing mutations and identifies stabilizing mutations aligned with experimental data. Moreover, ThermoRL accurately detects key mutation sites in unseen proteins, highlighting its strong generalizability. This RL-guided approach powered by GNN embeddings offers a robust alternative to traditional protein mutation design."
2507.19229,"The modeling of genomic sequences presents unique challenges due to their length and structural complexity. Traditional sequence models struggle to capture long-range dependencies and biological features inherent in DNA. In this work, we propose TrinityDNA, a novel DNA foundational model designed to address these challenges. The model integrates biologically informed components, including Groove Fusion for capturing DNA's structural features and Gated Reverse Complement (GRC) to handle the inherent symmetry of DNA sequences. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale attention mechanism that allows the model to attend to varying levels of sequence dependencies, and an evolutionary training strategy that progressively adapts the model to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. TrinityDNA provides a more accurate and efficient approach to genomic sequence modeling, offering significant improvements in gene function prediction, regulatory mechanism discovery, and other genomics applications. Our model bridges the gap between machine learning techniques and biological insights, paving the way for more effective analysis of genomic data. Additionally, we introduced a new DNA long-sequence CDS annotation benchmark to make evaluations more comprehensive and oriented toward practical applications."
2507.19246,"While generally considered computationally expensive, Uncertainty Quantification using Monte Carlo sampling remains beneficial for applications with uncertainties of high dimension. As an extension of the naive Monte Carlo method, the Multi-Level Monte Carlo method reduces the overall computational effort, but is unable to reduce the time to solution in a sufficiently parallel computing environment. In this work, we propose a Uncertainty Quantification method combining Multi-Level Monte Carlo sampling and Parallel-in-Time integration for select samples, exploiting remaining parallel computing capacity to accelerate the computation. While effective at reducing the time-to-solution, Parallel-in-Time integration methods greatly increase the total computational effort. We investigate the tradeoff between time-to-solution and total computational effort of the combined method, starting from theoretical considerations and comparing our findings to two numerical examples. There, a speedup of 12 - 45% compared to Multi-Level Monte Carlo sampling is observed, with an increase of 15 - 18% in computational effort."
2507.19255,"Parametric surrogate models of electric machines are widely used for efficient design optimization and operational monitoring. Addressing geometry variations, spline-based computer-aided design representations play a pivotal role. In this study, we propose a novel approach that combines isogeometric analysis, proper orthogonal decomposition and deep learning to enable rapid and physically consistent predictions by directly learning spline basis coefficients. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated using a parametric nonlinear magnetostatic model of a permanent magnet synchronous machine."
2507.19316,"As demand for high-purity lithium surges with the growth of the electric vehicle (EV) industry, cost-effective extraction from lower-grade North American sources like the Smackover Formation is critical. These resources, unlike high-purity South American brines, require innovative purification techniques to be economically viable. Continuous crystallization is a promising method for producing battery-grade lithium carbonate, but its optimization is challenged by a complex parameter space and limited data. This study introduces a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning framework to optimize the continuous crystallization of lithium carbonate. By integrating human expertise with data-driven insights, our approach accelerates the optimization of lithium extraction from challenging sources. Our results demonstrate the framework's ability to rapidly adapt to new data, significantly improving the process's tolerance to critical impurities like magnesium from the industry standard of a few hundred ppm to as high as 6000 ppm. This breakthrough makes the exploitation of low-grade, impurity-rich lithium resources feasible, potentially reducing the need for extensive pre-refinement processes. By leveraging artificial intelligence, we have refined operational parameters and demonstrated that lower-grade materials can be used without sacrificing product quality. This advancement is a significant step towards economically harnessing North America's vast lithium reserves, such as those in the Smackover Formation, and enhancing the sustainability of the global lithium supply chain."
2507.19388,"Topology optimization (TO) in two dimensions often presents a trade-off between structural performance and manufacturability, with unpenalized (variable-thickness) methods yielding superior but complex designs, and penalized (SIMP) methods producing simpler, truss-like structures with compromised performance. This paper introduces a multi-thickness, density-based topology optimization method designed to bridge this gap. The proposed approach guides the design towards a predefined set of discrete, allowable thicknesses by employing a novel multilevel penalization scheme and a multilevel smoothed Heaviside projection. A continuation strategy for the penalization and projection parameters, combined with an adaptive mesh refinement technique, ensures robust convergence and high-resolution geometric features. The method is validated on standard cantilever and MBB beam benchmarks. Results demonstrate that as the number of allowable thicknesses increases, the designs systematically transition from conventional truss-like structures to high-performance, sheet-like structures. Notably, designs with as few as three discrete thickness levels achieve compliance values within 2\% of those from fully unpenalized, variable-thickness optimization, while significantly outperforming standard SIMP results. The method inherently eliminates impractically thin regions and features, both in the out-of-plane and in-plane directions and produces designs well-suited for both additive manufacturing and conventional fabrication using standard-thickness stock materials, thus maximizing both performance and manufacturability."
2507.19406,"During brittle crack propagation, a smooth crack front curve frequently becomes disjoint, generating a stepped crack and a material ligament that unites the newly formed crack fronts. These universal features fundamentally alter the singular field structure and stability of propagating cracks; however, a quantitative analysis of their mechanics is lacking. Here, we perform in-situ 3D measurements to resolve the deformation field around stepped cracks, and crucially, within the ligament feature. The 3D kinematic data are obtained by scanning a thin laser sheet through the brittle hydrogel samples, while recording the scattered intensity from the embedded tracer particles. We find that the ligament concentrates the strain energy density, and moreover, the apparent fracture energy increases proportionally to the strain energy within the ligament."
2507.20162,"Timely disclosure of insider transactions is a cornerstone of market transparency, yet delays in filing remain widespread and challenging to monitor at scale. This study introduces a comprehensive insider filing delay dataset spanning more than four million Form 4 transactions from 2002 to 2025, enriched with annotations on insider roles, governance attributes, and firm-level indicators. Building on these data, we present a hybrid framework that integrates a state-space encoder with an XGBoost classifier to capture temporal trading patterns while retaining interpretability essential for regulatory auditing. The framework consistently outperforms statistical models, deep sequence learners, and large language model baselines, achieving balanced gains in precision, recall, and F1-score. Feature ablation analyses highlight the predictive importance of insider history, spatiotemporal factors, and governance signals, shedding light on the behavioral drivers of both minor oversights and systematic violations. Beyond accuracy, the dataset and framework establish a reproducible benchmark for studying disclosure compliance, offering regulators and researchers transparent tools to strengthen market integrity."
2507.20535,"Stock price movements are influenced by many factors, and alongside historical price data, tex-tual information is a key source. Public news and social media offer valuable insights into market sentiment and emerging events. These sources are fast-paced, diverse, and significantly impact future stock trends. Recently, LLMs have enhanced financial analysis, but prompt-based methods still have limitations, such as input length restrictions and difficulties in predicting sequences of varying lengths. Additionally, most models rely on dense computational layers, which are resource-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose the FTS- Text-MoE model, which combines numerical data with key summaries from news and tweets using point embeddings, boosting prediction accuracy through the integration of factual textual data. The model uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) Transformer decoder to process both data types. By activating only a subset of model parameters, it reduces computational costs. Furthermore, the model features multi-resolution prediction heads, enabling flexible forecasting of financial time series at different scales. Experimental results show that FTS-Text-MoE outperforms baseline methods in terms of investment returns and Sharpe ratio, demonstrating its superior accuracy and ability to predict future market trends."
2507.20719,"Our fully kinetic, implicit Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of global magnetospheres on up to 32,768 of El Capitan's AMD Instinct MI300A Accelerated Processing Units (APUs) represent an unprecedented computational capability that addresses a fundamental challenge in space physics: resolving the multi-scale coupling between microscopic (electron-scale) and macroscopic (global-scale) dynamics in planetary magnetospheres. The implicit scheme of iPIC3D supports time steps and grid spacing that are up to 10 times larger than those of explicit methods, without sacrificing physical accuracy. This enables the simulation of magnetospheres while preserving fine-scale electron physics, which is critical for key processes such as magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence. Our algorithmic and technological innovations include GPU-optimized kernels, particle control, and physics-aware data compression using Gaussian Mixture Models. With simulation domains spanning 100-1,000 ion skin depths, we reach the global scale of small-to-medium planetary magnetospheres, such as those of Mercury and Ganymede, which supports fully kinetic treatment of global-scale dynamics in systems previously out of reach for fully kinetic PIC codes."
2507.21749,"Training neural networks can be challenging, especially as the complexity of the problem increases. Despite using wider or deeper networks, training them can be a tedious process, especially if a wrong choice of the hyperparameter is made. The learning rate is one of such crucial hyperparameters, which is usually kept static during the training process. Learning dynamics in complex systems often requires a more adaptive approach to the learning rate. This adaptability becomes crucial to effectively navigate varying gradients and optimize the learning process during the training process. In this paper, a dynamic learning rate scheduler (DLRS) algorithm is presented that adapts the learning rate based on the loss values calculated during the training process. Experiments are conducted on problems related to physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and image classification using multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed DLRS accelerates training and improves stability."
2507.2199,"While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress, their application in scientific domains such as chemistry remains hindered by shallow domain understanding and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we focus on the specific field of chemistry and develop a Chemical Reasoner LLM, ChemDFM-R. We first construct a comprehensive dataset of atomized knowledge points to enhance the model's understanding of the fundamental principles and logical structure of chemistry. Then, we propose a mix-sourced distillation strategy that integrates expert-curated knowledge with general-domain reasoning skills, followed by domain-specific reinforcement learning to enhance chemical reasoning. Experiments on diverse chemical benchmarks demonstrate that ChemDFM-R achieves cutting-edge performance while providing interpretable, rationale-driven outputs. Further case studies illustrate how explicit reasoning chains significantly improve the reliability, transparency, and practical utility of the model in real-world human-AI collaboration scenarios."
2507.22195,"This paper introduces a high order numerical framework for efficient and robust simulation of compressible flows. To address the inefficiencies of standard hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods in large scale settings, we develop a macro element HDG method that reduces global and local degrees of freedom by embedding continuous Galerkin structure within macro-elements. This formulation supports matrix free implementations and enables highly parallel local solves, leading to substantial performance gains and excellent scalability on modern architectures. To enhance robustness in under resolved or turbulent regimes, we extend the method using entropy variables and a flux differencing approach to construct entropy stable and kinetic energy preserving variants. These formulations satisfy a discrete entropy inequality and improve stability without compromising high order accuracy. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on benchmark problems including the inviscid isentropic vortex and the Taylor Green vortex in both inviscid and turbulent regimes. Numerical results confirm optimal accuracy, improved robustness, and up to an order of magnitude speedup over standard HDG methods. These developments mark a significant advancement in high order methods for direct numerical simulation (DNS) of compressible flows."
2507.22309,"For centuries, financial institutions have responded to liquidity challenges by forming closed, centralized clearing clubs with strict rules and membership that allow them to collaborate on using the least money to discharge the most debt. As closed clubs, much of the general public has been excluded from participation. But the vast majority of private sector actors consists of micro or small firms that are vulnerable to late payments and generally ineligible for bank loans. This low liquidity environment often results in gridlock and leads to insolvency, and it disproportionately impacts small enterprises and communities.On the other hand, blockchain communities have developed open, decentralized settlement systems, along with a proliferation of store of value assets and new lending protocols, allowing anyone to permissionlessly transact and access credit. However, these protocols remain used primarily for speculative purposes, and so far have fallen short of the large-scale positive impact on the real economy prophesied by their promoters.We address these challenges by introducing Cycles, an open, decentralized clearing, settlement, and issuance protocol. Cycles is designed to enable firms to overcome payment inefficiencies, to reduce their working capital costs, and to leverage diverse assets and liquidity sources, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and lending protocols, in service of clearing more debt with less money. Cycles solves real world liquidity challenges through a privacy-preserving multilateral settlement platform based on a graph optimization algorithm. The design is based on a core insight: liquidity resides within cycles in the payment network's structure and can be accessed via settlement flows optimized to reduce debt."
2507.22678,"Physics-informed holomorphic neural networks (PIHNNs) have recently emerged as efficient surrogate models for solving differential problems. By embedding the underlying problem structure into the network, PIHNNs require training only to satisfy boundary conditions, often resulting in significantly improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). In this work, we improve and extend the application of PIHNNs to two-dimensional problems. First, we introduce a novel holomorphic network architecture based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation (PIHKAN), which achieves higher accuracy with reduced model complexity. Second, we develop mathematical extensions that broaden the applicability of PIHNNs to a wider class of elliptic partial differential equations, including the Helmholtz equation. Finally, we propose a new method based on Laurent series theory that enables the application of holomorphic networks to multiply-connected plane domains, thereby removing the previous limitation to simply-connected geometries."
2507.22804,"This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for performance-driven structural design that combines bottom-up design generation with learned strategies to efficiently search large combinatorial design spaces. Motivated by the limitations of conventional top-down approaches such as optimization, the framework instead models structures as compositions of predefined elements, aligning form finding with practical constraints like constructability and component reuse. With the formulation of the design task as a sequential decision-making problem and a human learning inspired training algorithm, the method adapts reinforcement learning for structural design. The framework is demonstrated by designing steel braced truss frame cantilever structures, where trained policies consistently generate distinct, high-performing designs that display structural performance and material efficiency with the use of structural strategies that align with known engineering principles. Further analysis shows that the agent efficiently narrows its search to promising regions of the design space, revealing transferable structural knowledge."
2507.22838,"Computational modelling offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to experimental studies in biomedical engineering. In cardiac electro-mechanics, finite element method (FEM)-based simulations provide valuable insights into diseased tissue behaviour and the development of assistive systems such as di-electric elastomer actuators. However, the use of automatically generated tetrahedral meshes, commonly applied due to geometric complexity, often leads to numerical issues including overly stiff responses and volume locking, particularly in incompressible materials. Smoothed finite element methods (S-FEMs) offer a promising alternative by softening the stiffness matrix through gradient smoothing over defined smoothing domains. This work extends S-FEM formulations to electro-mechanically coupled problems and compares their performance against standard linear FEM. We implement and evaluate four approaches in the Abaqus environment via custom user elements: standard linear FEM, face-based S-FEM (FS-FEM), node-based S-FEM (NS-FEM), and the hybrid face/node-based S-FEM (FSNS-FEM). Two benchmark problems are studied: the electrically induced contraction of a compressible dielectric elastomer and an incompressible, orthotropic myocardial tissue sample. Reference solutions are obtained using a mesh consisting of higher-order elements. Our results demonstrate that FSNS-FEM provides the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, closely matching reference data. NS-FEM produces softer results, which leads to an overestimation of the true deformation. FS-FEM and standard FEM consistently exhibit overly stiff behaviour, with pronounced volume locking in the myocardial case. These findings support the potential of S-FEMs, in particular FSNS-FEM, for accurate simulation of coupled electro-mechanical behaviour in complex biomedical applications."
2507.22859,"Dental crowns are essential dental treatments for restoring damaged or missing teeth of patients. Recent design approaches of dental crowns are carried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a preparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually define a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a non-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework to determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A dataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to train a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was modified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth into two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary faces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to train 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their results to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and optimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation results. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to represent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the centers of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that an ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest number of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance threshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground truth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the preparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth margin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683). We provide the train and test datasets for the community."
2507.2302,"Digital engineering has transformed the design and development process. However, the utility of digital engineering is fundamentally dependent on the assumption that a simulation provides information consistent with reality. This relationship is described as model fidelity. Despite the widespread use of the term, existing definitions of model fidelity often lack formal rigor in practical application, which leaves ambiguity in how this similarity should be evaluated. This paper presents seven fundamental axioms to aid the development of future fidelity evaluation frameworks. An example of a ground vehicle model is used under an existing fidelity evaluation framework to observe the applicability of these axioms. In addition, these axioms are used as a reference point for considering future opportunities in future work related to model fidelity."
2507.23218,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have garnered significant attention in financial asset pricing, due to their strong capacity for modeling complex nonlinear relationships within financial data. However, sophisticated models are prone to over-fitting to the noise information in financial data, resulting in inferior performance. To address this issue, we propose an information bottleneck asset pricing model that compresses data with low signal-to-noise ratios to eliminate redundant information and retain the critical information for asset pricing. Our model imposes constraints of mutual information during the nonlinear mapping process. Specifically, we progressively reduce the mutual information between the input data and the compressed representation while increasing the mutual information between the compressed representation and the output prediction. The design ensures that irrelevant information, which is essentially the noise in the data, is forgotten during the modeling of financial nonlinear relationships without affecting the final asset pricing. By leveraging the constraints of the Information bottleneck, our model not only harnesses the nonlinear modeling capabilities of deep networks to capture the intricate relationships within financial data but also ensures that noise information is filtered out during the information compression process."
2507.23443,"We introduce an adjoint-based aerodynamic shape optimization framework that integrates a diffusion model trained on existing designs to learn a smooth manifold of aerodynamically viable shapes. This manifold is enforced as an equality constraint to the shape optimization problem. Central to our method is the computation of adjoint gradients of the design objectives (e.g., drag and lift) with respect to the manifold space. These gradients are derived by first computing shape derivatives with respect to conventional shape design parameters (e.g., Hicks-Henne parameters) and then backpropagating them through the diffusion model to its latent space via automatic differentiation. Our framework preserves mathematical rigor and can be integrated into existing adjoint-based design workflows with minimal modification. Demonstrated on extensive transonic RANS airfoil design cases using off-the-shelf and general-purpose nonlinear optimizers, our approach eliminates ad hoc parameter tuning and variable scaling, maintains robustness across initialization and optimizer choices, and achieves superior aerodynamic performance compared to conventional approaches. This work establishes how AI generated priors integrates effectively with adjoint methods to enable robust, high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization through automatic differentiation."
2508.00193,"This work presents a practical finite element modeling strategy, the Crack Element Method (CEM), for simulating the dynamic crack propagation in two-dimensional structures. The method employs an element-splitting algorithm based on the Edge-based Smoothed Finite Element Method (ES-FEM) to capture the element-wise crack growth while reducing the formation of poorly shaped elements that can compromise numerical accuracy and computational performance. A fracture energy release rate formulation is also developed based on the evolving topology of the split elements. The proposed approach is validated through a series of classical benchmark problems, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness in addressing dynamic fracture scenarios. Finally, the applicability of the CEM is illustrated in a case study involving patterned Cu/Ultra Low-k interconnect structures."
2508.00451,"Modeling stochastic dynamics from discrete observations is a key interdisciplinary challenge. Existing methods often fail to estimate the continuous evolution of probability densities from trajectories or face the curse of dimensionality. To address these limitations, we presents a novel paradigm: modeling dynamics directly in the weight space of a neural network by projecting the evolving probability distribution. We first theoretically establish the connection between dynamic optimal transport in measure space and an equivalent energy functional in weight space. Subsequently, we design WeightFlow, which constructs the neural network weights into a graph and learns its evolution via a graph controlled differential equation. Experiments on interdisciplinary datasets demonstrate that WeightFlow improves performance by an average of 43.02\% over state-of-the-art methods, providing an effective and scalable solution for modeling high-dimensional stochastic dynamics."
2508.00654,"In the interdisciplinary field of microscopy research, managing and integrating large volumes of data stored across disparate platforms remains a major challenge. Data types such as bioimages, experimental records, and spectral information are often maintained in separate repositories, each following different management standards. However, linking these data sources across the research lifecycle is essential to align with the FAIR principles of data management: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Despite this need, there is a notable lack of tools capable of effectively integrating and linking data from heterogeneous sources. To address this gap, we present LEO (Linking Electronic Lab Notebooks with OMERO), a web-based platform designed to create and manage links between distributed data systems. LEO was initially developed to link objects between Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) and OMERO, but its functionality has since been extended through a plugin-based architecture, allowing the integration of additional data sources. This extensibility makes LEO a scalable and flexible solution for a wide range of microscopy research workflows."
2508.00773,"Cardiorespiratory coupling (CRC) captures the dynamic interaction between the cardiac and respiratory systems--an interaction strengthened by physical exercise and linked to improved physiological function. We examined CRC at high altitude in two states, rest and post-exercise recovery, and found significant differences (p < 0.05). Quantitative analysis revealed that recovery involved more frequent yet less stable episodes of synchronization between respiration and pulse. Furthermore, we explored the feasibility of non-contact CRC measurement with remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), observing a strong correlation with oximeter-based metrics (Pearson r = 0.96). These findings highlight the potential of CRC as a sensitive marker for autonomic regulation and its future application in contactless monitoring. Source code is available at GitHub:this https URL."
2508.00778,"Smart rings have emerged as uniquely convenient devices for continuous physiological and behavioral sensing, offering unobtrusive, constant access to metrics such as heart rate, motion, and skin temperature. Yet most commercial solutions remain proprietary, hindering reproducibility and slowing innovation in wearable research. We introduce {\tau}-Ring, a commercial-ready platform that bridges this gap through: (i) accessible hardware combining time-synchronized multi-channel PPG, 6-axis IMU, temperature sensing, NFC, and on-board storage; (ii) adjustable firmware that lets researchers rapidly reconfigure sampling rates, power modes, and wireless protocols; and (iii) a fully open-source Android software suite that supports both real-time streaming and 8-hour offline logging. Together, these features enable out-of-the-box, reproducible acquisition of rich physiological and behavioral datasets, accelerating prototyping and standardizing experimentation.

While SSMs are known for their efficiency and long-range modeling capabilities, they are typically trained offline and remain static during deployment. Our method enables online adaptation by continuously updating model parameters in response to incoming data. We evaluate our approach for linear-recurrent-unit SSMs using a small carbon emission dataset collected from embedded automotive hardware. Experimental results show that our method consistently reduces prediction error online during inference, demonstrating its potential for dynamic, resource-constrained environments."
2508.00828,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has emerged as a transformative force in financial analysis and the finance industry, though significant questions remain about the full capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in this domain. We present the Finance Agent Benchmark, featuring challenging and diverse real-world finance research problems that require LLMs to perform complex analysis using recent SEC filings. We construct the benchmark using a taxonomy of nine financial task categories, developed in consultation with experts from banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms. The dataset includes 537 expert-authored questions covering tasks from information retrieval to complex financial modeling, each validated through a rigorous review process to ensure accuracy and relevance. Moreover, we implement an agentic harness that equips LLMs with tools sufficient to produce accurate responses, including Google Search and EDGAR database access. Overall, the Finance Agent Benchmark provides a comprehensive testbed for measuring the progress of LLM-driven finance agents. Our evaluation reveals significant limitations in current AI capabilities - even the best-performing model (OpenAI o3) achieved only 46.8% accuracy at an average cost of $3.79 per query. This underscores the need for further advancements before reliable deployment in high-stakes finance settings."
2508.0083,"We introduce BikeBench, an engineering design benchmark for evaluating generative models on problems with multiple real-world objectives and constraints. As generative AI's reach continues to grow, evaluating its capability to understand physical laws, human guidelines, and hard constraints grows increasingly important. Engineering product design lies at the intersection of these difficult tasks, providing new challenges for AI capabilities. BikeBench evaluates AI models' capabilities to generate bicycle designs that not only resemble the dataset, but meet specific performance objectives and constraints. To do so, BikeBench quantifies a variety of human-centered and multiphysics performance characteristics, such as aerodynamics, ergonomics, structural mechanics, human-rated usability, and similarity to subjective text or image prompts. Supporting the benchmark are several datasets of simulation results, a dataset of 10,000 human-rated bicycle assessments, and a synthetically generated dataset of 1.6M designs, each with a parametric, CAD/XML, SVG, and PNG representation. BikeBench is uniquely configured to evaluate tabular generative models, large language models (LLMs), design optimization, and hybrid algorithms side-by-side. Our experiments indicate that LLMs and tabular generative models fall short of hybrid GenAI+optimization algorithms in design quality, constraint satisfaction, and similarity scores, suggesting significant room for improvement. We hope that BikeBench, a first-of-its-kind benchmark, will help catalyze progress in generative AI for constrained multi-objective engineering design problems.

2508.00831,"Engineering design optimization seeks to automatically determine the shapes, topologies, or parameters of components that maximize performance under given conditions. This process often depends on physics-based simulations, which are difficult to install, computationally expensive, and require domain-specific expertise. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce EngiBench, the first open-source library and datasets spanning diverse domains for data-driven engineering design. EngiBench provides a unified API and a curated set of benchmarks -- covering aeronautics, heat conduction, photonics, and more -- that enable fair, reproducible comparisons of optimization and machine learning algorithms, such as generative or surrogate models. We also release EngiOpt, a companion library offering a collection of such algorithms compatible with the EngiBench interface. Both libraries are modular, letting users plug in novel algorithms or problems, automate end-to-end experiment workflows, and leverage built-in utilities for visualization, dataset generation, feasibility checks, and performance analysis. We demonstrate their versatility through experiments comparing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple engineering design problems, an undertaking that was previously prohibitively time-consuming to perform. Finally, we show that these problems pose significant challenges for standard machine learning methods due to highly sensitive and constrained design manifolds."
2508.00833,"The generation of multiphase porous electrode microstructures with optimum morphological and transport properties is essential in the design of improved electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries. Electrode characteristics directly influence battery performance by acting as the main sites where the electrochemical reactions coupled with transport processes occur. This work presents a generation-optimisation closed-loop algorithm for the design of microstructures with tailored properties. A deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Network is used as a deep kernel and employed to generate synthetic three-phase three-dimensional images of a porous lithium-ion battery cathode material. A Gaussian Process Regression uses the latent space of the generator and serves as a surrogate model to correlate the morphological and transport properties of the synthetic microstructures. This surrogate model is integrated into a deep kernel Bayesian optimisation framework, which optimises cathode properties as a function of the latent space of the generator. A set of objective functions were defined to perform the maximisation of morphological properties (e.g., volume fraction, specific surface area) and transport properties (relative diffusivity). We demonstrate the ability to perform simultaneous maximisation of correlated properties (specific surface area and relative diffusivity), as well as constrained optimisation of these properties. This is the maximisation of morphological or transport properties constrained by constant values of the volume fraction of the phase of interest. Visualising the optimised latent space reveals its correlation with morphological properties, enabling the fast generation of visually realistic microstructures with customised properties."
2508.01081,"Structural health monitoring (SHM) ensures the safety and longevity of structures such as aerospace equipment and wind power installations. Developing a simple, highly flexible, and scalable SHM method that does not depend on baseline models is significant for ensuring the operational integrity of advanced composite structures. In this regard, a hybrid baseline-free damage detection and localization framework incorporating an unsupervised Kolmogorov-Arnold autoencoder (KAE) and modified probabilistic elliptical imaging algorithm (MRAPID) is proposed for damage detection and localization in composite structures. Specifically, KAE was used to process the guided wave signals (GW) without any prior feature extraction process. The KAE continuously learns and adapts to the baseline model of each structure, learning from the response characteristics of its undamaged state. Then, the predictions from KAE are processed, combined with the MRAPID to generate a damage probability map. The performance of the proposed method for damage detection and localization was verified using the simulated damage data obtained on wind turbine blades and the actual damage data obtained on composite flat plates. The results show that the proposed method can effectively detect and localize damage and can achieve multiple damage localization. In addition, the method outperforms classical damage detection algorithms and state-of-the-art baseline-free damage detection and localization methods in terms of damage localization accuracy."
2508.01537,"Learning-based fluid simulation networks have been proven as viable alternatives to traditional numerical solvers for the Navier-Stokes equations. Existing neural methods follow Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) frameworks, which inherently rely only on local inter-particle interactions. However, we emphasize that global context integration is also essential for learning-based methods to stabilize complex fluid simulations. We propose the first Fluid Attention Block (FAB) with a local-global hierarchy, where continuous convolutions extract local features while self-attention captures global dependencies. This fusion suppresses the error accumulation and models long-range physical phenomena. Furthermore, we pioneer the first Transformer architecture specifically designed for continuous fluid simulation, seamlessly integrated within a dual-pipeline architecture. Our method establishes a new paradigm for neural fluid simulation by unifying convolution-based local features with attention-based global context modeling. FluidFormer demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with stronger stability in complex fluid scenarios."
2508.02456,"Systems design processes are increasingly reliant on simulation models to inform design decisions. A pervasive issue within the systems engineering community is trusting in the models used to make decisions about complex systems. This work presents a method of evaluating the trustworthiness of a model to provide utility to a designer making a decision within a design process. Trusting the results of a model is especially important in design processes where the system is complex, novel, or displays emergent phenomena. Additionally, systems that are in the pre-prototype stages of development often do not have sources of ground truth for validating the models. Developing methods of model validation and trust that do not require real-world data is a key challenge facing systems engineers. Model fidelity in this work refers to the adherence of a model to real-world physics and is closely tied to model trust and model validity. Trust and validity directly support a designer's ability to make decisions using physics-based models. The physics that are captured in a model and the complexity of the mathematical representation of the physics contribute to a model's fidelity, and this work leverages the included physical phenomena to develop a means of selecting the most appropriate for a given design decision."
2508.02673,"Decision diagrams (DDs) are a powerful data structure that is used to tackle the state-space explosion problem, not only for discrete systems, but for probabilistic and quantum systems as well. While many of the DDs used in the probabilistic and quantum domains make use of floating-point numbers, this is not without challenges. Floating-point computations are subject to small rounding errors, which can affect both the correctness of the result and the effectiveness of the DD's compression. In this paper, we investigate the numerical stability, i.e. the robustness of an algorithm to small numerical errors, of matrix-vector multiplication with multi-terminal binary decision diagrams (MTBDDs). Matrix-vector multiplication is of particular interest because it is the function that computes successor states for both probabilistic and quantum systems. We prove that the MTBDD matrix-vector multiplication algorithm can be made numerically stable under certain conditions, although in many practical implementations of MTBDDs these conditions are not met. Additionally, we provide a case study of the numerical errors in the simulation of quantum circuits, which shows that the extent of numerical errors in practice varies greatly between instances."
2508.02692,"Optimization-based PDE solvers that minimize scalar loss functions have gained increasing attention in recent years. These methods either define the loss directly over discrete variables, as in Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL), or indirectly through a neural network surrogate, as in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, despite their promise, such methods often converge much more slowly than classical iterative solvers and are commonly regarded as inefficient. This work provides a theoretical insight, attributing the inefficiency to the use of the mean squared error (MSE) loss, which implicitly forms the normal equations, squares the condition number, and severely impairs optimization. To address this, we propose a novel Stabilized Gradient Residual (SGR) loss. By tuning a weight parameter, it flexibly modulates the condition number between the original system and its normal equations, while reducing to the MSE loss in the limiting case. We systematically benchmark the convergence behavior and optimization stability of the SGR loss within both the ODIL framework and PINNs-employing either numerical or automatic differentiation-and compare its performance against classical iterative solvers. Numerical experiments on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that, within the ODIL framework, the proposed SGR loss achieves orders-of-magnitude faster convergence than the MSE loss. Further validation within the PINNs framework shows that, despite the high nonlinearity of neural networks, SGR consistently outperforms the MSE loss. These theoretical and empirical findings help bridge the performance gap between classical iterative solvers and optimization-based solvers, highlighting the central role of loss conditioning, and provide key insights for the design of more efficient PDE solvers."
2508.02728,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the numerical-experimental mechanical behavior modeling of the recycled polymer, that is, recyclable polyethylene terephthalate (rPET), manufactured by a deposition FFF process under compressive stresses for new sustainable designs. In all, 42 test specimens were manufactured and analyzed according to the ASTM D695-15 standards. Eight numerical analyzes were performed on a real design manufactured with rPET using Young's compression modulus from the experimental tests. Finally, eight additional experimental tests under uniaxial compression loads were performed on the real sustainable design for validating its mechanical behavior versus computational numerical tests. As a result of the experimental tests, rPET behaves linearly until it reaches the elastic limit, along each manufacturing axis. The results of this study confirmed the design's structural safety by the load scenario and operating boundary conditions. Experimental and numerical results show a difference of 0.001-0.024 mm, allowing for the rPET to be configured as isotropic in numerical simulation software without having to modify its material modeling equations. The results obtained are of great help to industry, designers and researchers because they validate the use of recycled rPET for the ecological production of real-sustainable products using MEX technology under compressive stress and its configuration for numerical simulations. Major design companies are now using recycled plastic materials in their high-end designs. Validation results have been presented on test specimens and real items, comparing experimental material configuration values with numerical results."
2508.02875,"Soft-walled microchannels arise in many applications, ranging from organ-on-a-chip platforms to soft-robotic actuators. However, despite extensive research on their static and dynamic response, the potential failure of these devices has not been addressed. To this end, we explore fluid--structure interaction in microchannels whose compliant top wall is governed by a nonlocal mechanical theory capable of simulating both deformation and material failure. We develop a one-dimensional model by coupling viscous flow under the lubrication approximation to a state-based peridynamic formulation of an Euler--Bernoulli beam. The peridynamic formulation enables the wall to be modeled as a genuinely nonlocal beam, and the integral form of its equation of motion remains valid whether the deformation field is smooth or contains discontinuities. Through the proposed computational model, we explore the steady and time-dependent behaviors of this fluid--peridynamic structure interaction. We rationalize the wave and damping dynamics observed in the simulations through a dispersion (linearized) analysis of the coupled system, finding that, with increasing nonlocal influence, wave propagation exhibits a clear departure from classical behavior, characterized by a gradual suppression of the phase velocity. The main contribution of our study is to outline the potential failure scenarios of the microchannel's soft wall under the hydrodynamic load of the flow. Specifically, we find a dividing curve in the space spanned by the dimensionless Strouhal number (quantifying unsteady inertia of the beam) and the compliance number (quantifying the strength of the fluid--structure coupling) separating scenarios of potential failure during transient conditions from potential failure at the steady load."
2508.0337,"The core challenge in automotive exterior design is balancing subjective aesthetics with objective aerodynamic performance while dramatically accelerating the development cycle. To address this, we propose a novel, LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates the end-to-end workflow from ambiguous requirements to 3D concept model performance validation. The workflow is structured in two stages: conceptual generation and performance validation. In the first stage, agents collaborate to interpret fuzzy design requirements, generate concept sketches, and produce photorealistic renderings using diffusion models. In the second stage, the renderings are converted to 3D point clouds, where a Drag Prediction Agent, built upon a lightweight surrogate model, provides near-instantaneous predictions of the drag coefficient and pressure fields, replacing time-consuming CFD simulations. The primary contribution of this work is the seamless integration of creative generation with a rapid engineering validation loop within a unified, automated system, which provides a new paradigm for efficiently balancing creative exploration with engineering constraints in the earliest stages of design."
2508.03464,"With the rapid growth in demand for AI-generated content (AIGC), edge AIGC service providers (ASPs) have become indispensable. However, designing incentive mechanisms that motivate ASPs to deliver high-quality AIGC services remains a challenge, especially in the presence of information asymmetry. In this paper, we address bonus design between a teleoperator and an edge ASP when the teleoperator cannot observe the ASP's private settings and chosen actions (diffusion steps). We formulate this as an online learning contract design problem and decompose it into two subproblems: ASP's settings inference and contract derivation. To tackle the NP-hard setting-inference subproblem with unknown variable sizes, we introduce a large language model (LLM)-empowered framework that iteratively refines a naive seed solver using the LLM's domain expertise. Upon obtaining the solution from the LLM-evolved solver, we directly address the contract derivation problem using convex optimization techniques and obtain a near-optimal contract. Simulation results on our Unity-based teleoperation platform show that our method boosts the teleoperator's utility by $5 \sim 40\%$ compared to benchmarks, while preserving positive incentives for the ASP. The code is available atthis https URL."
2508.04014,"Plasmonic devices, fundamental to modern nanophotonics, exploit resonant interactions between light and free electrons in metals to achieve enhanced light trapping and electromagnetic field confinement. However, modeling their complex, nonlinear optical responses remains computationally intensive. In this work, we combine finite-difference time-domain simulations with machine learning to simulate and predict absorbed power behavior in multilayer plasmonic stacks composed of SiO2, gold, silver, and indium tin oxide. By varying Au and Ag thicknesses (10-50nm) across a spectral range of 300-1500nm, we generate spatial absorption maps and integrated power metrics from full-wave solutions to Maxwell's equations. A multilayer perceptron models global absorption behavior with a mean absolute error of 0.0953, while a convolutional neural network predicts spatial absorption distributions with an MAE of 0.0101. SHapley Additive exPlanations identify plasmonic layer thickness and excitation wavelength as dominant contributors to absorption, which peaks between 450 and 850~nm. Gold demonstrates broader and more sustained absorption compared to silver, although both metals exhibit reduced efficiency outside the resonance window. This integrated FDTD-ML framework offers a fast, explainable, and accurate approach for investigating tunable plasmonic behavior in multilayer systems, with applications in optical sensing, photovoltaics, and nanophotonic device design."
2508.04076,"This work presents a novel three-dimensional Crack Element Method (CEM) designed to model transient dynamic crack propagation in quasi-brittle materials efficiently. CEM introduces an advanced element-splitting algorithm that enables element-wise crack growth, including crack branching. Based on the evolving topology of split elements, an original formulation for computing the fracture energy release rate in three dimensions is derived. A series of benchmark examples is conducted to demonstrate that the proposed 3D CEM accurately simulates both single crack propagation and complex crack branching scenarios. Furthermore, all three-dimensional simulations are GPU-accelerated, achieving high levels of computational efficiency, consistency, and accuracy."
2508.04084,"In this work, we perform a comprehensive investigation of autoencoders for reduced-order modeling of three-dimensional multiphase flows. Focusing on the accuracy of reconstructing multiphase flow volume/mass fractions with a standard convolutional architecture, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of different interface representation choices (diffuse, sharp, level set). We use a combination of synthetic data with non-trivial interface topologies and high-resolution simulation data of multiphase homogeneous isotropic turbulence for training and validation. This study clarifies the best practices for reducing the dimensionality of multiphase flows via autoencoders. Consequently, this paves the path for uncoupling the training of autoencoders for accurate reconstruction and the training of temporal or input/output models such as neural operators (e.g., FNOs, DeepONets) and neural ODEs on the lower-dimensional latent space given by the autoencoders. As such, the implications of this study are significant and of interest to the multiphase flow community and beyond."
2508.04157,"As blockchain technology rapidly evolves, researchers face a significant challenge due to diverse and non-standardized simulation parameters, which hinder the replicability and comparability of research methodologies.

GFOBS provides a flexible platform that supports various optimization algorithms, variables, and objectives, thereby catering to a wide range of blockchain research needs. The paper's key contributions are threefold: the development of GFOBS as a versatile tool for blockchain simulation optimization; the introduction of an innovative optimization method using warm starting technique; and the proposition of a novel concurrent multiprocessing technique for simultaneous simulation processes. These advancements collectively enhance the efficiency, replicability, and standardization of blockchain simulation experiments."
2508.04301,"We present a general framework to predict precursors to extreme events in turbulent dynamical systems. The approach combines phase-space reconstruction techniques with recurrence matrices and convolutional neural networks to identify precursors to extreme events. We evaluate the framework across three distinct testbed systems: a triad turbulent interaction model, a prototype stochastic anisotropic turbulent flow, and the Kolmogorov flow. This method offers three key advantages: (1) a threshold-free classification strategy that eliminates subjective parameter tuning, (2) efficient training using only $\mathcal{O}(100)$ recurrence matrices, and (3) ability to generalize to unseen systems. The results demonstrate robust predictive performance across all test systems: 96\% detection rate for the triad model with a mean lead time of 1.8 time units, 96\% for the anisotropic turbulent flow with a mean lead time of 6.1 time units, and 93\% for the Kolmogorov flow with a mean lead time of 22.7 units."
2508.04306,"Compounding error is critical in long-form literature review generation, where minor inaccuracies cascade and amplify across subsequent steps, severely compromising the faithfulness of the final output. To address this challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Taskforce Collaboration (MATC) framework, which proactively mitigates errors by orchestrating LLM-based agents into three specialized taskforces: (1) an exploration taskforce that interleaves retrieval and outlining using a tree-based strategy to establish a grounded structure; (2) an exploitation taskforce that iteratively cycles between fact location and draft refinement to ensure evidential support; and (3) a feedback taskforce that leverages historical experience for self-correction before errors propagate. Experimental results show that MATC achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks (AutoSurvey and SurveyEval), significantly outperforming strong baselines in both citation quality (e.g., +15.7% recall) and content quality. We further contribute TopSurvey, a new large-scale benchmark of 195 peer-reviewed survey topics, on which MATC maintains robust performance, demonstrating its generalizability."
2508.04307,"We demonstrate that Principal Component Analysis (PCA), when applied in a structured manner, either to polar-transformed images or segment-wise to token sequences, enables extreme compression of neural models without sacrificing performance. Across three case studies, we show that a one-layer classifier trained on PCA-compressed polar MNIST achieves over 98 percent accuracy using only 840 parameters. A two-layer transformer trained on 70-dimensional PCA-reduced MiniLM embeddings reaches 76.62 percent accuracy on the 20 Newsgroups dataset with just 81000 parameters. A decoder-only transformer generates coherent token sequences from 70-dimensional PCA embeddings while preserving over 97 percent cosine similarity with full MiniLM representations, using less than 17 percent of the parameter count of GPT-2. These results highlight PCA-based input compression as a general and effective strategy for aligning model capacity with information content, enabling lightweight architectures across multiple modalities."
2508.04538,"Reliable assessment of concrete degradation is critical for ensuring structural safety and longevity of engineering structures. This study proposes a self-supervised domain adaptation framework for robust concrete damage classification using coda wave signals. To support this framework, an advanced virtual testing platform is developed, combining multiscale modeling of concrete degradation with ultrasonic wave propagation simulations. This setup enables the generation of large-scale labeled synthetic data under controlled conditions, reducing the dependency on costly and time-consuming experimental labeling. However, neural networks trained solely on synthetic data often suffer from degraded performance when applied to experimental data due to domain shifts. To bridge this domain gap, the proposed framework integrates domain adversarial training, minimum class confusion loss, and the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) strategy. These components work jointly to facilitate effective knowledge transfer from the labeled simulation domain to the unlabeled experimental domain, achieving accurate and reliable damage classification in concrete. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves notable performance improvements, reaching an accuracy of 0.7762 and a macro F1 score of 0.7713, outperforming both the plain 1D CNN baseline and six representative domain adaptation techniques. Moreover, the method exhibits high robustness across training runs and introduces only minimal additional computational cost. These findings highlight the practical potential of the proposed simulation-driven and label-efficient framework for real-world applications in structural health monitoring."
2508.04875,"Electricity price forecasting in Europe presents unique challenges due to the continent's increasingly integrated and physically interconnected power market. While recent advances in deep learning and foundation models have led to substantial improvements in general time series forecasting, most existing approaches fail to capture the complex spatial interdependencies and uncertainty inherent in electricity markets. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset across 24 European countries (38 regions), spanning from 2022-01-01 to 2025-01-01. Building on this groundwork, we propose PriceFM, a spatiotemporal foundation model that integrates graph-based inductive biases to capture spatial interdependencies across interconnected electricity markets. The model is designed for multi-region, multi-timestep, and multi-quantile probabilistic electricity price forecasting. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm the model's effectiveness, consistently outperforming competitive baselines and highlighting the importance of spatial context in electricity markets.

2508.04975,"Traditionally, traders and quantitative analysts address alpha decay by manually crafting formulaic alphas, mathematical expressions that identify patterns or signals in financial data, through domain expertise and trial-and-error. This process is often time-consuming and difficult to scale. With recent advances in large language models (LLMs), it is now possible to automate the generation of such alphas by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates a prompt-based LLM with a Transformer model for stock price prediction. The LLM first generates diverse and adaptive alphas using structured inputs such as historical stock features (Close, Open, High, Low, Volume), technical indicators, sentiment scores of both target and related companies. These alphas, instead of being used directly for trading, are treated as high-level features that capture complex dependencies within the financial data. To evaluate the effectiveness of these LLM-generated formulaic alphas, the alpha features are then fed into prediction models such as Transformer, LSTM, TCN, SVR, and Random Forest to forecast future stock prices. Experimental results demonstrate that the LLM-generated alphas significantly improve predictive accuracy. Moreover, the accompanying natural language reasoning provided by the LLM enhances the interpretability and transparency of the predictions, supporting more informed financial decision-making."
2508.05418,"Shockwave classification in shadowgraph imaging is challenging due to limited labeled data and complex flow structures. This study presents a hybrid framework that combines unsupervised autoencoder models with a fuzzy inference system to generate and interpret anomaly maps. Among the evaluated methods, the hybrid $\beta$-VAE autoencoder with a fuzzy rule-based system most effectively captured coherent shock features, integrating spatial context to enhance anomaly classification. The resulting approach enables interpretable, unsupervised classification of flow disruptions and lays the groundwork for real-time, physics-informed diagnostics in experimental and industrial fluid applications."
2508.05425,"Despite their significant economic contributions, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) face persistent barriers to securing traditional financing due to information asymmetries. Cash flow lending has emerged as a promising alternative, but its effectiveness depends on accurate modelling of transaction-level data. The main challenge in SME transaction analysis lies in the unstructured nature of textual descriptions, characterised by extreme abbreviations, limited context, and imbalanced label distributions. While consumer transaction descriptions often show significant commonalities across individuals, SME transaction descriptions are typically nonstandard and inconsistent across businesses and industries. To address some of these challenges, we propose a bank categorisation pipeline that leverages synthetic data generation to augment existing transaction data sets. Our approach comprises three core components: (1) a synthetic data generation module that replicates transaction properties while preserving context and semantic meaning; (2) a fine-tuned classification model trained on this enriched dataset; and (3) a calibration methodology that aligns model outputs with real-world label distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves 73.49% (+-5.09) standard accuracy on held-out data, with high-confidence predictions reaching 90.36% (+-6.52) accuracy. The model exhibits robust generalisation across different types of SMEs and transactions, which makes it suitable for practical deployment in cash-flow lending applications. By addressing core data challenges, namely, scarcity, noise, and imbalance, our framework provides a practical solution to build robust classification systems in data-sparse SME lending contexts."
2508.05491,"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into startup evaluation represents a significant technological shift, yet the academic research underpinning this transition remains methodologically fragmented. Existing studies often employ ad-hoc approaches, leading to a body of work with inconsistent definitions of success, atheoretical features, and a lack of rigorous validation. This fragmentation severely limits the comparability, reliability, and practical utility of current predictive models.To address this critical gap, this paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of 57 empirical studies. We deconstruct the current state-of-the-art by systematically mapping the features, algorithms, data sources, and evaluation practices that define the AI-driven startup prediction landscape. Our synthesis reveals a field defined by a central paradox: a strong convergence on a common toolkit -- venture databases and tree-based ensembles -- but a stark divergence in methodological rigor. We identify four foundational weaknesses: a fragmented definition of ""success,"" a divide between theory-informed and data-driven feature engineering, a chasm between common and best-practice model validation, and a nascent approach to data ethics and explainability.In response to these findings, our primary contribution is the proposal of the Systematic AI-driven Startup Evaluation (SAISE) Framework. This novel, five-stage prescriptive roadmap is designed to guide researchers from ad-hoc prediction toward principled evaluation. By mandating a coherent, end-to-end methodology that emphasizes stage-aware problem definition, theory-informed data synthesis, principled feature engineering, rigorous validation, and risk-aware interpretation, the SAISE framework provides a new standard for conducting more comparable, robust, and practically relevant research in this rapidly maturing domain"
2508.05624,"Topology optimization enables the automated design of efficient structures by optimally distributing material within a defined domain. However, traditional gradient-based methods often scale poorly with increasing resolution and dimensionality due to the need for repeated finite element analyses and sensitivity evaluations. In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines latent diffusion models (LDMs) with variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable fast, conditional generation of optimized topologies. Unlike prior approaches, our method conditions the generative process on physically meaningful fields, specifically von Mises stress, strain energy density, volume fraction, and loading information, embedded as dense input channels. To further guide the generation process, we introduce auxiliary loss functions that penalize floating material, load imbalance, and volume fraction deviation, thereby encouraging physically realistic and manufacturable designs. Numerical experiments on a large synthetic dataset demonstrate that our VAE-LDM framework outperforms existing diffusion-based methods in compliance accuracy, volume control, and structural connectivity, providing a robust and scalable alternative to conventional"
2508.06234,"Benchmark scenarios are widely used in transportation research to evaluate routing algorithms, simulate infrastructure interventions, and test new technologies under controlled conditions. However, the structural and behavioral fidelity of these benchmarks remains largely unquantified, raising concerns about the external validity of simulation results. In this study, we introduce a mathematical framework based on higher-order network models to evaluate the representativeness of benchmark networks, focusing on the widely used Sioux Falls scenario. Higher-order network models encode empirical and simulated trajectory data into memory-aware network representations, which we use to quantify sequential dependencies in mobility behavior and assess how well benchmark networks capture real-world structural and functional patterns. Applying this framework to the Sioux Falls network, as well as real-world trajectory data, we quantify structural complexity, optimal memory length, link prediction accuracy, and centrality alignment. Our results show and statistically quantify that the classical Sioux Falls network exhibits limited path diversity, rapid structural fragmentation at higher orders, and weak alignment with empirical routing behavior. These results illustrate the potential of higher-order network models to bridge the gap between simulation-based and real-world mobility analysis, providing a robust foundation for more accurate and generalizable insights in transportation research."
2508.06312,"Alpha factor mining is a fundamental task in quantitative trading, aimed at discovering interpretable signals that can predict asset returns beyond systematic market risk. While traditional methods rely on manual formula design or heuristic search with machine learning, recent advances have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated factor discovery. However, existing LLM-based alpha mining approaches remain limited in terms of automation, generality, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Chain-of-Alpha, a novel, simple, yet effective and efficient LLM-based framework for fully automated formulaic alpha mining. Our method features a dual-chain architecture, consisting of a Factor Generation Chain and a Factor Optimization Chain, which iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine candidate alpha factors using only market data, while leveraging backtest feedback and prior optimization knowledge. The two chains work synergistically to enable high-quality alpha discovery without human intervention and offer strong scalability. Extensive experiments on real-world A-share benchmarks demonstrate that Chain-of-Alpha outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, presenting a promising direction for LLM-driven quantitative research."
2508.06386,"Agricultural landscapes face the dual challenge of sustaining food production while reversing biodiversity loss. Agri-environmental policies often fall short of delivering ecological functions such as landscape connectivity, in part due to a persistent disconnect between farm-level economic decisions and landscape-scale spatial planning. We introduce a novel hierarchical optimization framework that bridges this gap. First, an Ecological Intensification (EI) model determines the economically optimal allocation of land to margin and habitat interventions at the individual farm level. These farm-specific intervention levels are then passed to an Ecological Connectivity (EC) model, which spatially arranges them across the landscape to maximize connectivity while preserving farm-level profitability. Finally, we introduce a Bayesian Optimization (BO) approach that translates these spatial outcomes into simple, cost effective, and scalable policy instruments, such as subsidies and eco-premiums, using non-spatial, farm-level policy parameters. Applying the framework to a Canadian agricultural landscape, we demonstrate how it enhances connectivity under real-world economic constraints. Our approach provides a globally relevant tool for aligning farm incentives with biodiversity goals, advancing the development of agri-environmental policies that are economically viable and ecologically effective."
2508.06771,"We study parallel particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for low-temperature plasmas (LTPs), which discretize kinetic formulations that capture the time evolution of the probability density function of particles as a function of position and velocity. We use a kinetic description for electrons and a fluid approximation for heavy species. In this paper, we focus on GPU acceleration of algorithms for velocity-space interactions and in particular, collisions of electrons with neutrals, ions, and electrons. Our work has two thrusts. The first is algorithmic exploration and analysis. The second is examining the viability of rapid-prototyping implementations using Python-based HPC tools, in particular PyKokkos. We discuss several common PIC kernels and present performance results on NVIDIA Volta V100 and AMD MI250X GPUs. Overall, the MI250X is slightly faster for most kernels but shows more sensitivity to register pressure. We also report scaling results for a distributed memory implementation on up to 16 MPI ranks."
2508.07076,"Biodiversity monitoring represents a pressing global priority, and assessing forest community composition plays a crucial role due to its influence on ecosystem functions. The spatial distribution of forest species becomes essential for understanding biodiversity dynamics, territorial planning, aiding nature conservation and enhancing ecosystem resilience amid global change. Association Rule Mining, commonly applied to other scientific contexts, is now innovatively adopted in the ecological field to explore the relationships among co-occurring plant species and extract hidden interpretable patterns, also with abiotic and biotic conditions. Multiple heterogeneous data sources were integrated through data preprocessing into a unique dataset, including georeferenced information about 151 plant species monitored within 6,784 plots across Italy and several bioclimatic indices, soil-related factors, and variables from earth observations. The Frequent Pattern Growth algorithm, used for association rule mining, provided interesting and encouraging findings, suggesting ecological rules among plant species and environmental conditions. Indeed, temperature seasonality between 650-700 and precipitation seasonality between 45-50 resulted very correlated with Picea abies (confidence = 90.9%, lift = 7.13). Patterns detected for Picea abies highlighted its ecological specificity, indicating a strong association with cold, highly seasonal environments, and particular plant communities. Some species appeared acting as community ""hubs"", frequently co-occurring with other species, suggesting ties to specific environmental or biotic conditions. These findings represent a valuable resource for future research, especially in regions with similar environmental settings and when prior ecological knowledge exists, also underlining the importance of publicly accessible, high-quality ecological data."
2508.07309,"The Harmonic Balance-Alternating Frequency-Time domain (HB-AFT) method is extensively employed for dynamic response analysis of nonlinear systems. However, its application to high-dimensional complex systems is constrained by the manual derivation of Jacobian matrices during Newton-Raphson iterations, which become computationally intractable or error-prone for intricate nonlinearities. The Harmonic Balance-Automatic Differentiation (HB-AD) method is proposed to address this limitation, in which AD is integrated with the harmonic balance framework. This approach eliminates all manual derivations by leveraging AD to compute exact Jacobians numerically, enabling generic and efficient analysis of high-dimensional complex nonlinear systems. The implementation utilizes advanced deep learning frameworks for native parallel computing and CUDA acceleration, and combines AD with arc-length continuation, establishing an out-of-the-box and high efficiency computational architecture. Users need only supply the system's dynamic equations, HB-AD then autonomously trace the complete panorama of periodic responses -- including stable/unstable solution branches. Computational experiments on a rotor system with squeeze-film damper (SFD) demonstrate HB-AD's capability in handling complex nonlinear expressions with automated Jacobian calculations. For a high-dimensional aero-engine rotor-bearing-casing system with complex bearing nonlinearities, HB-AD achieves 17-fold higher efficiency than traditional HB-AFT and 144-fold acceleration over the Newmark method. The HB-AD method is a synergistic merger of computational mechanics and machine learning primitives, delivers an easy to use, general-purpose, high efficiency platform for high-fidelity dynamic characterization of high-dimensional engineering systems."
2508.07476,"Understanding the architecture of the human heart requires analysis of its microstructural organization across scales. With the advent of high-resolution imaging techniques such as synchrotron-based tomography, it has become possible to visualize entire hearts at micron-scale resolution. However, translating these large, complex volumetric datasets into interpretable, quantitative descriptors of cardiac organization remains a major challenge. Here we present cardiotensor, an open-source Python package designed to quantify 3D cardiomyocyte orientation in whole- or partial-heart imaging datasets. It provides efficient, scalable implementations of structure tensor analysis, enabling extraction of directional metrics such as helical angle (HA), intrusion angle (IA), and fractional anisotropy (FA). The package supports datasets reaching teravoxel-scale and is optimized for high-performance computing environments, including parallel and chunk-based processing pipelines. In addition, cardiotensor includes tractography functionality to reconstruct continuous cardiomyocyte trajectories. This enables multi-scale myoaggregate visualization down to the myocyte level, depending on resolution. These capabilities enable detailed structural mapping of cardiac tissue, supporting the assessment of anatomical continuity and regional organization."
2508.07831,"We propose Material Fingerprinting, a new method for the rapid discovery of mechanical material models from direct or indirect data that avoids solving potentially non-convex optimization problems. The core assumption of Material Fingerprinting is that each material exhibits a unique response when subjected to a standardized experimental setup. We can interpret this response as the material's fingerprint, essentially a unique identifier that encodes all pertinent information about the material's mechanical characteristics. Consequently, once we have established a database containing fingerprints and their corresponding mechanical models during an offline phase, we can rapidly characterize an unseen material in an online phase. This is accomplished by measuring its fingerprint and employing a pattern recognition algorithm to identify the best matching fingerprint in the database. In our study, we explore this concept in the context of hyperelastic materials, demonstrating the applicability of Material Fingerprinting across different experimental setups. Initially, we examine Material Fingerprinting through experiments involving homogeneous deformation fields, which provide direct strain-stress data pairs. We then extend this concept to experiments involving complexly shaped specimens with heterogeneous deformation fields, which provide indirect displacement and reaction force measurements. We show that, in both cases, Material Fingerprinting is an efficient tool for model discovery, bypassing the challenges of potentially non-convex optimization. We believe that Material Fingerprinting provides a powerful and generalizable framework for rapid material model identification across a wide range of experimental designs and material behaviors, paving the way for numerous future developments."
2508.0832,"Acknowledging the ever-increasing demand for composites in the engineering industry, this paper focuses on the failure of composites at the microscale and augmenting the use of multiscale modelling techniques to make them better for various applications. This work aims to increase the representativeness of the volume element by attenuating the mesh and size sensitivities in representative volume element (RVE) modelling. A technique to alleviate mesh sensitivity in RVE modelling is proposed, which equalises the fracture energy observed from computational analysis with the real phenomenon, thereby keeping the response independent of the bandwidth of strain localisation. Based on the hypothesis that ensuring periodicity of strain, in addition to displacement periodicity across the domain boundary and supplementing the capability of periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) to attenuate the size dependency in RVE modelling, a set of modified PBCs (MPBCs) are formulated. One thousand two hundred RVE samples falling into combinations of five fibre volume fractions and four RVE sizes are analysed under transverse loading, and the ability of MPBCs to attenuate the effect of RVE size on the precision of material response, particularly in the inelastic regime, is verified. This work also focuses on various factors affecting damage initiation in 2D composite RVEs. The arrangement of a pair of fibres with their members placed close to each other, such that the angle between the direction of loading and an imaginary line drawn between their centres is less, is observed to make the region between them more favourable to damage."
2508.09589,"This paper presents a novel space-time topology optimisation framework for time-dependent thermal conduction problems, aiming to significantly reduce the time-to-solution. By treating time as an additional spatial dimension, we discretise the governing equations using a stabilised continuous Galerkin space-time finite element method. The resulting large all-at-once system is solved using an iterative Krylov solver preconditioned with a parallel space-time multigrid method employing a semi-coarsening strategy. Implemented in a fully parallel computing framework, the method yields a parallel-in-time method that demonstrates excellent scalability on a distributed-memory supercomputer, solving problems up to 4.2 billion degrees of freedom. Comparative studies show up to 52x speed-up over traditional time-stepping approaches, with only moderate increases in total computational cost in terms of core-hours. The framework is validated on benchmark problems with both time-constant and time-varying designs, and its flexibility is demonstrated through variations in material properties. These results establish the proposed space-time method as a promising approach for large-scale time-dependent topology optimisation in thermal applications."
2508.09641,"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold great promise for automating complex financial analysis. To comprehensively evaluate their capabilities, we introduce VisFinEval, the first large-scale Chinese benchmark that spans the full front-middle-back office lifecycle of financial tasks. VisFinEval comprises 15,848 annotated question-answer pairs drawn from eight common financial image modalities (e.g., K-line charts, financial statements, official seals), organized into three hierarchical scenario depths: Financial Knowledge & Data Analysis, Financial Analysis & Decision Support, and Financial Risk Control & Asset Optimization. We evaluate 21 state-of-the-art MLLMs in a zero-shot setting. The top model, Qwen-VL-max, achieves an overall accuracy of 76.3%, outperforming non-expert humans but trailing financial experts by over 14 percentage points. Our error analysis uncovers six recurring failure modes-including cross-modal misalignment, hallucinations, and lapses in business-process reasoning-that highlight critical avenues for future research. VisFinEval aims to accelerate the development of robust, domain-tailored MLLMs capable of seamlessly integrating textual and visual financial information.

2508.09897,"Deriving governing equations from observational data, known as Symbolic Regression (SR), is a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Large Language Models, (LLMs) have shown promise in this task by leveraging their vast cross-disciplinary scientific knowledge. However, existing LLM-based methods primarily rely on direct inference or prompt engineering, often requiring excessive inference iterations to converge on correct formulas or failing to treat complex equation targets. These limitations in effectiveness and generalization stem from an inherent tension between pre-trained LLMs' proficiency in approximate reasoning and the high-precision demands of SR tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose to fine-tune LLMs for enhanced SR capability. Yet, the absence of dedicated datasets for SR-oriented fine-tuning remains a critical barrier. We thus introduce SymbArena, specifically engineered to optimize LLMs for SR. This benchmark comprises over 148,000 diverse equations formulated as corpora of 1.83 billion tokens for LLM utilization, enabling effective training and inference. Further, to ensure a more comprehensive and fair evaluation, SymbArena proposes a heuristics metric to precisely quantify form-level consistency, going beyond existing SR numerical-oriented evaluation strategies. With this benchmark, we explore mainstream LLM fine-tuning techniques for SR tasks and establish Symbolic-R1, a simple yet effective LLM-based SR strong baseline. Experimental results validate Symbolic-R1 as the first LLM to exceed traditional numerical methods in both numerical precision and symbolic form accuracy, outperforming the second-best LLM baseline with improvements of 2-fold gains in R2 score and 10.3% in form-level consistency score."
2508.10216,"The chemical industry is increasingly prioritising sustainability, with a focus on reducing carbon footprints to achieve net zero. By 2026, the Together for Sustainability (TfS) consortium will require reporting of biogenic carbon content (BCC) in chemical products, posing a challenge as BCC depends on feedstocks, value chain configuration, and process-specific variables. While carbon-14 isotope analysis can measure BCC, it is impractical for continuous industrial monitoring. This work presents CarAT (Carbon Atom Tracker), an automated methodology for calculating BCC across industrial value chains, enabling dynamic and accurate sustainability reporting. The approach leverages existing Enterprise Resource Planning data in three stages: (1) preparing value chain data, (2) performing atom mapping in chemical reactions using chemistry language models, and (3) applying a linear program to calculate BCC given known inlet compositions. The methodology is validated on a 27-node industrial toluene diisocyanate value chain. Three scenarios are analysed: a base case with fossil feedstocks, a case incorporating a renewable feedstock, and a butanediol value chain with a recycle stream. Results are visualised with Sankey diagrams showing the flow of carbon attributes across the value chain. The key contribution is a scalable, automated method for real-time BCC calculation under changing industrial conditions. CarAT supports compliance with upcoming reporting mandates and advances carbon neutrality goals by enabling systematic fossil-to-biogenic substitution. Through transparent, auditable tracking of carbon sources in production networks, it empowers data-driven decisions to accelerate the transition to sustainable manufacturing."
2508.1032,"Compositionally Graded Alloys (CGAs) offer unprecedented design flexibility by enabling spatial variations in composition; tailoring material properties to local loading conditions. This flexibility leads to components that are stronger, lighter, and more cost-effective than traditional monolithic counterparts. The fabrication of CGAs have become increasingly feasible owing to recent advancements in additive manufacturing (AM), particularly in multi-material printing and improved precision in material deposition. However, AM of CGAs requires imposition of manufacturing constraints; in particular limits on the maximum spatial gradation of composition.This paper introduces a topology optimization (TO) based framework for designing optimized CGA components with controlled compositional gradation. In particular, we represent the constrained composition distribution using a band-limited coordinate neural network. By regulating the network's bandwidth, we ensure implicit compliance with gradation limits, eliminating the need for explicit constraints. The proposed approach also benefits from the inherent advantages of TO using coordinate networks, including mesh independence, high-resolution design extraction, and end-to-end differentiability. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated through various elastic and thermo-elastic TO examples."
2508.10696,"In the real world, a molecule is a 3D geometric structure. Compared to 1D SMILES sequences and 2D molecular graphs, 3D molecules represent the most informative molecular modality. Despite the rapid progress of autoregressive-based language models, they cannot handle the generation of 3D molecular conformation due to several challenges: 1) 3D molecular structures are incompatible with LLMs' discrete token space, 2) integrating heterogeneous inputs like proteins, ligands, and text remains difficult within a unified model, and 3) LLMs lack essential scientific priors, hindering the enforcement of physical and chemical constraints during generation. To tackle these issues, we present Chem3DLLM, a unified protein-conditioned multimodal large language model. Our approach designs a novel reversible text encoding for 3D molecular structures using run-length compression, achieving 3x size reduction while preserving complete structural information. This enables seamless integration of molecular geometry with protein pocket features in a single LLM architecture. We employ reinforcement learning with stability-based rewards to optimize chemical validity and incorporate a lightweight protein embedding projector for end-to-end training. Experimental results on structure-based drug design demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with a Vina score of -7.21, validating our unified multimodal approach for practical drug discovery applications."
2508.11967,"The microstructure critically governs the properties of materials used in energy and chemical engineering technologies, from catalysts and filters to thermal insulators and sensors. Therefore, accurate design is based on quantitative descriptors of microstructural features. Here we show that eight key descriptors can be extracted by a single workflow that fuses computational topology with assembly-learning-based regression. First, 1312 synthetic three-dimensional microstructures were generated and evaluated using established algorithms, and a labeled data set of ground-truth parameters was built. Converting every structure into a persistence image allowed us to train a deep neural network that predicts the eight descriptors. In an independent test set, the model achieved on average R^2 ~ 0.84 and Pearson r ~ 0.92, demonstrating both precision and generality. The approach provides a unified and scalable tool for rapid characterization of functional porous materials."

2508.12799,"The 2015 Paris Agreement on global warming specifies national objectives for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In support of Switzerland's energy and climate strategy for 2050, researchers investigate scenarios for the transition of energy systems towards a higher share of renewables, assessing their social, environmental and economic impact. Their results guide stakeholders and policy makers in designing resilient and sustainable systems. Political scientists use surveys to quantify public acceptance of energy policy, but the complexity and long time horizon of the subject creates difficulties, both for researchers in posing contextually relevant questions, and for respondents in assimilating enough information to give meaningful answers. A population survey was therefore augmented with an online serious game in which players experience an accurate simulation of current and future energy provision and manage transition towards a sustainable future. This interactive environment allows better informed and engaged decisions, and provides richer information on public opinion. In this paper we motivate and describe the design of the game and report initial findings on player characteristics and engagement. We show that a serious game can successfully attract participants from diverse societal groups and highlight the challenge of balancing complexity and entertainment."
2508.13097,"Programmable structures are systems whose undeformed geometries and material property distributions are deliberately designed to achieve prescribed deformed configurations under specific loading conditions. Inflatable structures are a prominent example, using internal pressurization to realize large, nonlinear deformations in applications ranging from soft robotics and deployable aerospace systems to biomedical devices and adaptive architecture. We present a generative design framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for the inverse design of elastic structures undergoing large, nonlinear deformations under pressure-driven actuation. The method formulates the inverse design as a conditional generation task, using geometric descriptors of target deformed states as inputs and outputting image-based representations of the undeformed configuration. Representing these configurations as simple images is achieved by establishing a pre- and postprocessing pipeline that involves a fixed image processing, simulation setup, and descriptor extraction methods. Numerical experiments with scalar and higher-dimensional descriptors show that the framework can quickly produce diverse undeformed configurations that achieve the desired deformations when inflated, enabling parallel exploration of viable design candidates while accommodating complex constraints."
2508.13164,"The paper presents an innovative methodology based on the use of a new predictive algorithm created by the researchers capable of obtaining the elastic modulus of a plastic material manufactured with MEX and its mechanical behaviour in the elastic zone under compressive loads. The predictive algorithm only needs as input the compressive elastic modulus of the isotropic plastic material filament and the manufacturing parameters of the MEX process. The smart developed algorithm calculates the stiffness of each layer considering the number of holes in the projected area. The innovative predictive algorithm has been experimentally and numerically validated using PETG Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol material and PLA Polylactic Acid on test specimens and on a case study of variable topology. The predictive algorithm is valid for each print pattern and manufacturing direction. The new algorithm improves the existing state of the art significantly since this algorithm extends its utility to most plastic polymer materials suitable for MEX 3D printing, provided that the mechanical and elastic properties of the filament are known. Its versatility extends to complex component geometries subjected to uniaxial compression loads, eliminating the need for mechanical analysis software or expensive experimental validations."
2508.13491,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for financial applications, yet their suitability for this high-stakes domain remains largely unproven due to inadequacies in existing benchmarks. Existing benchmarks solely rely on score-level evaluation, summarizing performance with a single score that obscures the nuanced understanding of what models truly know and their precise limitations. They also rely on datasets that cover only a narrow subset of financial concepts, while overlooking other essentials for real-world applications. To address these gaps, we introduce FinCDM, the first cognitive diagnosis evaluation framework tailored for financial LLMs, enabling the evaluation of LLMs at the knowledge-skill level, identifying what financial skills and knowledge they have or lack based on their response patterns across skill-tagged tasks, rather than a single aggregated number. We construct CPA-KQA, the first cognitively informed financial evaluation dataset derived from the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) examination, with comprehensive coverage of real-world accounting and financial skills. It is rigorously annotated by domain experts, who author, validate, and annotate questions with high inter-annotator agreement and fine-grained knowledge labels. Our extensive experiments on 30 proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs show that FinCDM reveals hidden knowledge gaps, identifies under-tested areas such as tax and regulatory reasoning overlooked by traditional benchmarks, and uncovers behavioral clusters among models. FinCDM introduces a new paradigm for financial LLM evaluation by enabling interpretable, skill-aware diagnosis that supports more trustworthy and targeted model development, and all datasets and evaluation scripts will be publicly released to support further research."
2508.13763,"Multi-dimensional breakage is a ubiquitous phenomenon in natural systems, yet the systematic discovery of underlying governing equations remains a long-standing challenge. Current inverse solution techniques are restricted to one-dimensional cases and typically depend on the availability of a priori system knowledge, thus limiting their applicability. By leveraging advances in data-driven sparse regression techniques, we develop the Multi-Dimensional Breakage Population Balance Equation Identification (mPBE ID) algorithm for discovering multi-dimensional breakage population balance equations (mPBEs) directly from data. Our mPBE-ID enables tractable identification of mPBEs by incorporating several key strategies, namely, a breakage-informed constrained sparse regression, targeted candidate library functions construction via insights from Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), and robust handling of noisy/limited data through ensembling (bagging/bragging). Notably, we demonstrate how the DMD is indispensable for distilling dominant breakage dynamics which can then be used to facilitate the systematic inclusion of candidate library terms. We showcase the ability of the mPBE-ID to discover different forms of mPBE (including those with discontinuous stoichiometric kernels) even when tested against noisy and limited data. We anticipate that the mPBE-ID will serve as a foundational framework for future extensions to generalize the discovery of multi-dimensional PBEs for various high-dimensional particulate phenomena."

To bring it closer to home, we identify critical gaps in the African insurance market and highlight key local efforts, players, and partnership opportunities. Finally, we call upon actuaries, insurers, regulators, and tech leaders to a collaborative effort aimed at creating inclusive, sustainable, and equitable AI strategies and solutions: by and for Africans."
2508.15923,"Plastic anisotropy in metals remains challenging to model. This is partly because conventional phenomenological yield criteria struggle to combine a highly descriptive, flexible representation with constraints, such as convexity, dictated by thermodynamic consistency. To address this gap, we employ architecturally-constrained neural networks and develop two data-driven frameworks: (i) a hybrid model that augments the Hill yield criterion with an Input Convex Neural Network (ICNN) to get an anisotropic yield function representation in the six-dimensional stress space and (ii) a permutation-invariant input convex neural network (PI-ICNN) that learns an isotropic yield function representation in the principal stress space and embeds anisotropy through linear stress transformations. We calibrate the proposed frameworks on a sparse Al-7079 extrusion experimental dataset comprising 12 uniaxial samples with measured yield stresses and Lankford ratios. To test the robustness of each framework, nine datasets were generated using k-fold cross-validation. These datasets were then used to quantitatively compare Hill-48, Yld2004-18p, pure ICNNs, the hybrid approach, and the PI-ICNN frameworks. While ICNNs and hybrid approaches can almost perfectly fit the training data, they exhibit significant over-fitting, resulting in high validation and test losses. In contrast, both PI-ICNN frameworks demonstrate better generalization capabilities, even outperforming Yld2004-18p on the validation and test data. These results demonstrate that PI-ICNNs unify physics-based constraints with the flexibility of neural networks, enabling the accurate prediction of both yield loci and Lankford ratios from minimal data. The approach opens a path toward rapid, thermodynamically consistent constitutive models for advanced forming simulations and future exploration of coupled hardening or microstructure-informed design."
2508.15926,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in social science simulations. While their performance on reasoning and optimization tasks has been extensively evaluated, less attention has been paid to their ability to simulate human decision-making's variability and adaptability. We propose a process-oriented evaluation framework with progressive interventions (Intrinsicality, Instruction, and Imitation) to examine how LLM agents adapt under different levels of external guidance and human-derived noise. We validate the framework on two classic economics tasks, irrationality in the second-price auction and decision bias in the newsvendor problem, showing behavioral gaps between LLMs and humans.We find that LLMs, by default, converge on stable and conservative strategies that diverge from observed human behaviors. Risk-framed instructions impact LLM behavior predictably but do not replicate human-like diversity. Incorporating human data through in-context learning narrows the gap but fails to reach human subjects' strategic variability. These results highlight a persistent alignment gap in behavioral fidelity and suggest that future LLM evaluations should consider more process-level realism. We present a process-oriented approach for assessing LLMs in dynamic decision-making tasks, offering guidance for their application in synthetic data for social science research."
2508.16316,"A growing challenge in research and industrial engineering applications is the need for repeated, systematic analysis of large-scale computational models, for example, patient-specific digital twins of diseased human organs: The analysis requires efficient implementation, data, resource management, and parallelization, possibly on distributed systems. To tackle these challenges and save many researchers from annoying, time-consuming tasks, we present QUEENS (Quantification of Uncertain Effects in Engineering Systems), an open-source Python framework for composing and managing simulation analyses with arbitrary (physics-based) solvers on distributed computing infrastructures. Besides simulation management capabilities, QUEENS offers a comprehensive collection of efficiently implemented state-of-the-art algorithms ranging from routines for convergence studies and common optimization algorithms to more advanced sampling algorithms for uncertainty quantification and Bayesian inverse analysis. Additionally, we provide our latest cutting-edge research in multi-fidelity uncertainty quantification, efficient multi-fidelity Bayesian inverse analysis, and probabilistic machine learning. QUEENS adopts a Bayesian, probabilistic mindset but equally supports standard deterministic analysis without requiring prior knowledge of probability theory. The modular architecture allows rapid switching between common types of analyses and facilitates building sophisticated hierarchical algorithms. Encouraging natural incremental steps and scaling towards complexity allows researchers to consider the big picture while building towards it through smaller, manageable steps.

2508.16334,"Alpha mining, which discovers signals that predict asset returns, has long been attractive for automatic quantitative investment. This problem is typically formulated as a tree-based symbolic regression with handcrafted market data features and arithmetic operators. Unfortunately, existing symbolic methods are concerned with computational inefficiency and dependence on prior knowledge. Recent implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs) show that they can automatically generate executable codes for various tasks efficiently, thus can be considered as a new promising way for alpha mining. Specifically, LLMs-driven methods evolve a set of heuristics, including thoughts and codes, where the thoughts are usually represented as plain-text prompts of codes. Unfortunately, trivially adopting them in alpha mining ignores the fact that alphas are with hierarchical tree structures. This paper introduces Tree-structured thought Evolution (TreEvo), which evolves hierarchical reasoning ideas solely at the thought level. Experiments on four real-market datasets demonstrate that TreEvo can obtain better alphas with much less computational time and human expert efforts. And this superiority hardly holds without the tree-structured thoughts and the compatible evolutionary operators."
2508.1637,"A key factor in reducing the cost of green hydrogen production projects using water electrolysis systems is to minimize the degradation of the electrolyzer stacks, as this impacts the lifetime of the stacks and therefore the frequency of their replacement. To create a better understanding of the economics of stack degradation, we present a linear optimization approach minimizing the costs of a green hydrogen supply chain including an electrolyzer with degradation modeling. By calculating the levelized cost of hydrogen depending on a variable degradation threshold, the cost optimal time for stack replacement can be identified. We further study how this optimal time of replacement is affected by uncertainties such as the degradation scale, the load-dependency of both degradation and energy demand, and the costs of the electrolyzer. The variation of the identified major uncertainty degradation scale results in a difference of up to 9 years regarding the cost optimal time for stack replacement, respectively lifetime of the stacks. Therefore, a better understanding of the degradation impact is imperative for project cost reductions, which in turn would support a proceeding hydrogen market ramp-up."
2508.16378,"This paper presents a dynamic cryptocurrency portfolio optimization strategy that integrates technical indicators and sentiment analysis to enhance investment decision-making. The proposed method employs the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) and 14-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) to capture market momentum, while sentiment scores are extracted from news articles using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model, with compound scores quantifying overall market tone. The large language model Google Gemini is used to further verify the sentiment scores predicted by VADER and give investment decisions. These technical indicator and sentiment signals are incorporated into the expected return estimates before applying mean-variance optimization with constraints on asset weights. The strategy is evaluated through a rolling-window backtest over cryptocurrency market data, with Bitcoin (BTC) and an equal-weighted portfolio of selected cryptocurrencies serving as benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a cumulative return of 38.72, substantially exceeding Bitcoin's 8.85 and the equal-weighted portfolio's 21.65 over the same period, and delivers a higher Sharpe ratio (1.1093 vs. 0.8853 and 1.0194, respectively). However, the strategy exhibits a larger maximum drawdown (-18.52%) compared to Bitcoin (-4.48%) and the equal-weighted portfolio (-11.02%), indicating higher short-term downside risk. These results highlight the potential of combining sentiment and technical signals to improve cryptocurrency portfolio performance, while also emphasizing the need to address risk exposure in volatile markets."
2508.17564,"Topology Optimization (TO) holds the promise of designing next-generation compact and efficient fluidic devices. However, the inherent complexity of fluid-based TO systems, characterized by multiphysics nonlinear interactions, poses substantial barriers to entry for researchers.Beyond the inherent intricacies of forward simulation models, design optimization is further complicated by the difficulty of computing sensitivities, i.e., gradients. Manual derivation and implementation of sensitivities are often laborious and prone to errors, particularly for non-trivial objectives, constraints, and material models. An alternative solution is automatic differentiation (AD). Although AD has been previously demonstrated for simpler TO problems, extending its use to complex nonlinear multiphysics systems, specifically in fluidic optimization, is key to reducing the entry barrier.To this end, we introduce TOFLUX, a TO framework for fluid devices leveraging the JAX library for high-performance automatic differentiation. The flexibility afforded by AD enables the rapid exploration and evaluation of various objectives and constraints. We illustrate this capability through challenging examples encompassing thermo-fluidic coupling, fluid-structure interaction, and non-Newtonian flows. Additionally, we demonstrate the seamless integration of our framework with neural networks and machine learning methodologies, enabling modern approaches to scientific computing. Ultimately, the framework aims to provide a foundational resource to accelerate research and innovation in fluid-based TO.

2508.1817,"Reliability assessment of engineering systems is often hindered by the need to evaluate limit-state functions through computationally expensive simulations, rendering standard sampling impractical. An effective solution is to approximate the limit-state function with a surrogate model iteratively refined through active learning, thereby reducing the number of expensive simulations. At each iteration, an acquisition strategy selects the next sample by balancing two competing goals: exploration, to reduce global predictive uncertainty, and exploitation, to improve accuracy near the failure boundary. Classical strategies, such as the U-function and the Expected Feasibility Function (EFF), implicitly condense exploration and exploitation into a scalar score derived from the surrogate predictive mean and variance, concealing the trade-off and biasing sampling. We introduce a multi-objective optimization (MOO) formulation for sample acquisition in reliability analysis, where exploration and exploitation are explicit, competing objectives. Within our framework, U and EFF correspond to specific Pareto-optimal solutions, providing a unifying perspective that connects classical and Pareto-based approaches. Solving the MOO problem discards dominated candidates, yielding a compact Pareto set, with samples representing a quantifiable exploration-exploitation trade-off. To select samples from the Pareto set, we adopt the knee point and the compromise solution, and further propose a strategy that adjusts the trade-off according to reliability estimates. Across benchmark limit-state functions, we assess the sample efficiency and active learning performance of all strategies. Results show that U and EFF exhibit case-dependent performance, knee and compromise are generally effective, and the adaptive strategy is robust, consistently reaching strict targets and maintaining relative errors below 0.1%."
2509.00224,"This paper generalizes recent advances on quadratic manifold (QM) dimensionality reduction by developing kernel methods-based nonlinear-augmentation dimensionality reduction. QMs, and more generally feature map-based nonlinear corrections, augment linear dimensionality reduction with a nonlinear correction term in the reconstruction map to overcome approximation accuracy limitations of purely linear approaches. While feature map-based approaches typically learn a least-squares optimal polynomial correction term, we generalize this approach by learning an optimal nonlinear correction from a user-defined reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our approach allows one to impose arbitrary nonlinear structure on the correction term, including polynomial structure, and includes feature map and radial basis function-based corrections as special cases. Furthermore, our method has relatively low training cost and has monotonically decreasing error as the latent space dimension increases. We compare our approach to proper orthogonal decomposition and several recent QM approaches on data from several example problems."
2509.00604,"Coupled multiphysics simulations for high-dimensional, large-scale problems can be prohibitively expensive due to their computational demands. This article presents a novel framework integrating a deep operator network (DeepONet) with the Finite Element Method (FEM) to address coupled thermoelasticity and poroelasticity problems. This integration occurs within the context of I-FENN, a framework where neural networks are directly employed as PDE solvers within FEM, resulting in a hybrid staggered solver. In this setup, the mechanical field is computed using FEM, while the other coupled field is predicted using a neural network (NN). By decoupling multiphysics interactions, the hybrid framework reduces computational cost by simplifying calculations and reducing the FEM unknowns, while maintaining flexibility across unseen scenarios. The proposed work introduces a new I-FENN architecture with extended generalizability due to the DeepONets ability to efficiently address several combinations of natural boundary conditions and body loads. A modified DeepONet architecture is introduced to accommodate multiple inputs, along with a streamlined strategy for enforcing boundary conditions on distinct boundaries. We showcase the applicability and merits of the proposed work through numerical examples covering thermoelasticity and poroelasticity problems, demonstrating computational efficiency, accuracy, and generalization capabilities. In all examples, the test cases involve unseen loading conditions. The computational savings scale with the model complexity while preserving an accuracy of more than 95\% in the non-trivial regions of the domain."
2509.01079,"A thermo-mechanical fracture modeling is proposed to address thermal failure issues, where the temperature field is calculated by a heat conduction model based on classical continuum mechanics (CCM), while the deformation field with discontinuities is calculated by the peridynamic (PD) model. The model is calculated by a CCM/PD alternating solution based on the finite element discretization, which ensures the calculation accuracy and facilitates engineering applications. The original PD model defines damage solely based on the number of broken bonds in the vicinity of the material point, neglecting the distribution of these bonds. To address this limitation, a new definition of the PD damage accounting for both the number of broken bonds and their specific distribution is proposed. As a result, damage in various directions can be captured, enabling more realistic thermal fracture simulations based on a unified mesh discretization. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by comparing numerical examples with analytical solutions. Moreover, simulation results of quasi-static and dynamic crack propagation demonstrate the model's ability to aid in understanding the initiation and propagation mechanisms of complex thermal fractures."
2509.01234,"Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators, two leading scientific machine learning (SciML) paradigms, have emerged as powerful tools for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Although increasing the training sample size generally enhances network performance, it also increases computational costs for physics-informed or data-driven training. To address this trade-off, different sampling strategies have been developed to sample more points in regions with high PDE residuals. However, existing sampling methods are computationally demanding for high-dimensional problems, such as high-dimensional PDEs or operator learning tasks. Here, we propose a residual-based adversarial-gradient moving sample (RAMS) method, which moves samples according to the adversarial gradient direction to maximize the PDE residual via gradient-based optimization. RAMS can be easily integrated into existing sampling methods. Extensive experiments, ranging from PINN applied to high-dimensional PDEs to physics-informed and data-driven operator learning problems, have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of RAMS. Notably, RAMS represents the first efficient adaptive sampling approach for operator learning, marking a significant advancement in the SciML field."
2509.01274,"Biofilms are complex structures which are inhabited by numerous amount of different species of microorganisms. Due to their ubiquity, they influence human life on an everyday basis. It is therefore important to understand the interactions between different biofilm components and reactions to outside conditions. For this purpose, mathematical models and in silico experiments have proven themselves to be fundamental. In combination with in vitro and in vivo experiments, they can give more insights and focus researchers' attention, reducing costs in the process. In this work, a comprehensive multi-species continuum-based biofilm model is presented. This model is capable of replicating a variety of different biofilm interactions with an arbitrary number of species, while still being comprehensive to encourage usage by researchers less familiar with mathematical modeling. In addition to a nutrient source, antibiotic agents and their effect on the biofilm can also be depicted. The model is derived using Hamilton's principle of stationary action, ensuring thermodynamic consistency automatically. The results show good quantitative agreement with biofilm behavior."
2509.01393,"This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework that employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to dynamically optimize the weights of multiple large language model (LLM)-generated formulaic alphas for stock trading strategies. Formulaic alphas are mathematically defined trading signals derived from price, volume, sentiment, and other data. Although recent studies have shown that LLMs can generate diverse and effective alphas, a critical challenge lies in how to adaptively integrate them under varying market conditions. To address this gap, we leverage the deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b model to generate fifty alphas for five major stocks: Apple, HSBC, Pepsi, Toyota, and Tencent, and then use PPO to adjust their weights in real time. Experimental results demonstrate that the PPO-optimized strategy achieves strong returns and high Sharpe ratios across most stocks, outperforming both an equal-weighted alpha portfolio and traditional benchmarks such as the Nikkei 225, S&P 500, and Hang Seng Index. The findings highlight the importance of reinforcement learning in the allocation of alpha weights and show the potential of combining LLM-generated signals with adaptive optimization for robust financial forecasting and trading."

Based on the developed fracture energy release rate formulation of split elementary topology, the Multiple Crack-tips Tracking algorithm is proposed and a series of benchmark examples are provided to validate effectiveness and efficiency in modeling crack branching and fragmentation. Besides, the proposed MCR-2D-CEM can still model single crack propagation but extra micro-cracks are introduced. GPU acceleration is employed in all two-dimensional simulations, providing high computational efficiency, consistency, and accuracy."
2509.01963,"In response to recent FIA regulations reducing Formula 1 team wind tunnel hours (from 320 hours for last-place teams to 200 hours for championship leaders) and strict budget caps of 135 million USD per year, more efficient aerodynamic development tools are needed by teams. Conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, though offering high fidelity results, require large computational resources with typical simulation durations of 8-24 hours per configuration analysis. This article proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for the fast prediction of Formula 1 front wing aerodynamic coefficients. The suggested methodology combines CFD simulation data from SimScale with first principles of fluid dynamics through a hybrid loss function that constrains both data fidelity and physical adherence based on Navier-Stokes equations. Training on force and moment data from 12 aerodynamic features, the PINN model records coefficient of determination (R-squared) values of 0.968 for drag coefficient and 0.981 for lift coefficient prediction while lowering computational time. The physics-informed framework guarantees that predictions remain adherent to fundamental aerodynamic principles, offering F1 teams an efficient tool for the fast exploration of design space within regulatory constraints."
2509.02237,"We propose a non-intrusive, Autoencoder-based framework for reduced-order modeling in continuum mechanics. Our method integrates three stages: (i) an unsupervised Autoencoder compresses high-dimensional finite element solutions into a compact latent space, (ii) a supervised regression network maps problem parameters to latent codes, and (iii) an end-to-end surrogate reconstructs full-field solutions directly from input parameters.To overcome limitations of existing approaches, we propose two key extensions: a force-augmented variant that jointly predicts displacement fields and reaction forces at Neumann boundaries, and a multi-field architecture that enables coupled field predictions, such as in thermo-mechanical systems. The framework is validated on nonlinear benchmark problems involving heterogeneous composites, anisotropic elasticity with geometric variation, and thermo-mechanical coupling. Across all cases, it achieves accurate reconstructions of high-fidelity solutions while remaining fully non-intrusive.These results highlight the potential of combining deep learning with dimensionality reduction to build efficient and extensible surrogate models. Our publicly available implementation provides a foundation for integrating data-driven model order reduction into uncertainty quantification, optimization, and digital twin applications."
2509.02242,"Process optimization in chemical engineering may be hindered by the limited availability of reliable thermodynamic data for fluid mixtures. Remarkable progress is being made in predicting thermodynamic mixture properties by machine learning techniques. The vast information provided by these prediction methods enables new possibilities in process optimization. This work introduces a novel modelfluid representation that is designed to seamlessly integrate these ML-predicted data directly into flowsheet optimization. Tailored for distillation, our approach is built on physically interpretable and continuous features derived from core vapor liquid equilibrium phenomena. This ensures compatibility with existing simulation tools and gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate the power and accuracy of this ML-fueled modelfluid by applying it to the problem of entrainer selection for an azeotropic separation. The results show that our framework successfully identifies optimal, thermodynamically consistent entrainers with high fidelity compared to conventional models. Ultimately, this work provides a practical pathway to incorporate large-scale property prediction into efficient process design and optimization, overcoming the limitations of both traditional thermodynamic models and complex molecular-based equations of state."
2509.02486,"The stomach plays a central role in digestion through coordinated muscle contractions, known as gastric peristalsis, driven by slow-wave electrophysiology. Understanding this process is critical for treating motility disorders such as gastroparesis, dyspepsia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Computer simulations can be a valuable tool to deepen our understanding of these disorders and help to develop new therapies. However, existing approaches often neglect spatial heterogeneity, fail to capture large anisotropic deformations, or rely on computationally expensive three-dimensional formulations. We present here a computational framework of human gastric electromechanics, that combines a nonlinear, rotation-free shell formulation with a constrained mixture material model. The formulation incorporates active-strain, constituent-specific prestress, and spatially non-uniform parameter fields. Numerical examples demonstrate that the framework can reproduce characteristic features of gastric motility, including slow-wave entrainment, conduction velocity gradients, and large peristaltic contractions with physiologically realistic amplitudes. The proposed framework enables robust electromechanical simulations of the whole stomach at the organ scale. It thus provides a promising basis for future in silico studies of both physiological function and pathological motility disorders."
2509.02572,"Various aspects of the methods of physical and physicochemical modification of components of filled thermoplastic composite materials are analyzed, aimed at improving the surface properties of the fillers and the technological properties of the polymer matrix during their interaction. It is noted that the improvement of the interfacial interaction of the components of polymer reactoplastic composites, including adhesive strength, is a key factor for improving the reliability of the cured filled composite. As a promising area of research, a modification of the surface of the reinforcing fibrous filler and the technological characteristics of the liquid polymer binder, aimed at increasing their contact properties in the composite, was chosen. The effectiveness of the physical method of modifying the components of composites in the form of low-frequency ultrasonic processing is described. The peculiarities of cluster formation and physicochemical modification of epoxy polymers filled with dispersed fillers are analyzed. Attention is focused on the effectiveness of ultrasonic processing in the cavitation mode for deagglomeration and uniform distribution of nanoparticles in a liquid medium during the creation of nanocomposites. Experimentally confirmed is the improvement of the technological properties of liquid epoxy polymers, modified by ultrasound, used for the impregnation of oriented fibrous fillers, as well as the improvement of the physicomechanical properties of the sonicated epoxy matrices. Some issues of biological modifications of components of polymers for functional application are briefly reviewed."
2509.03687,"High-order derivatives of Green's functions are a key ingredient in Taylor-based fast multipole methods, Barnes-Hut $n$-body algorithms, and quadrature by expansion (QBX). In these settings, derivatives underpin either the formation, evaluation, and/or translation of Taylor expansions.In this article, we provide hybrid symbolic-numerical procedures that generate recurrences to attain an $O(n)$ cost for the the computation of $n$ derivatives (i.e. $O(1)$ per derivative) for arbitrary radially symmetric Green's functions. These procedures are general--only requiring knowledge of the PDE that the Green's function solves. We show that the algorithm has controlled, theoretically-understood error.We apply these methods to the method of quadrature by expansion, a method for the evaluation of singular layer potentials, which requires higher-order derivatives of Green's functions. In doing so, we contribute a new rotation-based method for target-specific QBX evaluation in the Cartesian setting that attains dramatically lower cost than existing symbolic approaches.Numerical experiments support our claims of accuracy and cost."
2509.04115,"Due to the strongly nonlinear behavior of ferromagnetic yokes, the numerical analysis of fast-ramping magnets is highly cumbersome and, therefore, in practice overly simplified by means of anhysteretic material descriptions and a posteriori loss formulae. This paper establishes the use of a dynamic ferromagnetic model combining a preconditioned energy-based hysteresis description and a thin-sheet eddy-current model in time-domain. The model was successfully employed in the analysis of a normal-conducting bending magnet in order to precisely calculate losses and fields."
2509.0421,"Chronic obesity management requires continuous monitoring of energy balance behaviors, yet traditional self-reported methods suffer from significant underreporting and recall bias, and difficulty in integration with modern digital health systems. This study presents COBRA (Chronic Obesity Behavioral Recognition Architecture), a novel deep learning framework for objective behavioral monitoring using wrist-worn multimodal sensors. COBRA integrates a hybrid D-Net architecture combining U-Net spatial modeling, multi-head self-attention mechanisms, and BiLSTM temporal processing to classify daily activities into four obesity-relevant categories: Food Intake, Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Daily Living. Validated on the WISDM-Smart dataset with 51 subjects performing 18 activities, COBRA's optimal preprocessing strategy combines spectral-temporal feature extraction, achieving high performance across multiple architectures. D-Net demonstrates 96.86% overall accuracy with category-specific F1-scores of 98.55% (Physical Activity), 95.53% (Food Intake), 94.63% (Sedentary Behavior), and 98.68% (Daily Living), outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 1.18% in accuracy. The framework shows robust generalizability with low demographic variance (<3%), enabling scalable deployment for personalized obesity interventions and continuous lifestyle monitoring."
2509.04971,"We consider a one-dimensional fracture problem modelled using either the phase-field or lip-field approach. In both cases, we optimise the incremental potential with respect to the displacement and damage fields and the nodal coordinates of the mesh. This is thus a variational mesh study. We observe that, as the damage reaches its maximum value, the optimisation drives the most damaged element to zero size as the damage reaches its maximum value. This peculiar element provides a precise displacement jump representation as the bar breaks. The overall solution is also shown to be much more accurate than the fixed mesh solution. This work forms part of an exploration into the capabilities of extreme meshes in computational mechanics (X-Mesh)."
2509.05061,"Accurately estimating the probability of failure in engineering systems under uncertainty is a fundamental challenge, particularly in high-dimensional settings and for rare events. Conventional reliability analysis methods often become computationally intractable or exhibit high estimator variance when applied to problems with hundreds of uncertain parameters or highly concentrated failure regions. In this work, we investigate the use of the recently proposed Deep Inverse Rosenblatt Transport (DIRT) framework for reliability analysis in solid mechanics. DIRT combines a TT decomposition with an inverse Rosenblatt transformation to construct a low-rank approximation of the posterior distribution, enabling efficient sampling and probability estimation in high-dimensional spaces. By representing the optimal importance density in the TT format, DIRT scales linearly in the input dimension while maintaining a compact, reusable surrogate of the target distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the DIRT framework on three analytical reliability problems and one numerical example with dimensionality ranging from 2 to 250. Compared to established methods such as Bayesian updating with Subset Simulation (BUS-SuS), DIRT seems to lower the estimator variance while accurately capturing rare event probabilities for the benchmark problems of this study."
2509.05448,"This position paper argues that machine learning for scientific discovery should shift from inductive pattern recognition to axiom-based reasoning. We propose a game design framework in which scientific inquiry is recast as a rule-evolving system: agents operate within environments governed by axioms and modify them to explain outlier observations. Unlike conventional ML approaches that operate within fixed assumptions, our method enables the discovery of new theoretical structures through systematic rule adaptation. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach through preliminary experiments in logic-based games, showing that agents can evolve axioms that solve previously unsolvable problems. This framework offers a foundation for building machine learning systems capable of creative, interpretable, and theory-driven discovery."
2509.05641,"Inverse design is a common yet challenging engineering problem, particularly for nonlinear functional responses such as mechanical behavior or spectral analysis. Deep generative models are motivated by intractability, non-existence or non-uniqueness of solutions, and the need for rapid solution-space exploration. In this study, we show that deep generative model-based and optimization-based approaches can provide incomplete solutions or hallucinate given out-of-distribution targets. To address this, we propose the Generative and Uncertainty-informed Inverse Design (GUIDe) framework, which leverages probabilistic machine learning, statistical inference, and Markov chain Monte Carlo to generate designs with targeted nonlinear behaviors. Instead of inverse mappings, i.e., response $\mapsto$ design, GUIDe adopts design $\mapsto$ response: a forward model predicts each design's nonlinear functional response and evaluates the confidence under a user-specified tolerance. Sampling the solution space by this confidence yields diverse feasible designs. Our validation on nacre-inspired materials finds solutions beyond the training range, even under out-of-distribution targets."
2509.058,"Topology optimization enables the design of highly efficient and complex structures, but conventional iterative methods, such as SIMP-based approaches, often suffer from high computational costs and sensitivity to initial conditions. Although machine learning methods have recently shown promise for accelerating topology generation, existing models either remain iterative or struggle to match ground-truth performance. In this work, we propose a transformer-based machine learning model for topology optimization that embeds critical boundary and loading conditions directly into the tokenized domain representation via a class token mechanism. We implement this model on static and dynamic datasets, using transfer learning and FFT encoding of dynamic loads to improve our performance on the dynamic dataset. Auxiliary loss functions are introduced to promote the realism and manufacturability of the generated designs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, including compliance error, volume fraction error, floating material percentage, and load discrepancy error, and benchmark it against state-of-the-art non-iterative and iterative generative models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model approaches the fidelity of diffusion-based models while remaining iteration-free, offering a significant step toward real-time, high-fidelity topology generation."
2509.05857,"Reverse engineering can be used to derive a 3D model of an existing physical part when such a model is not readily available. For parts that will be fabricated with subtractive and formative manufacturing processes, existing reverse engineering techniques can be readily applied, but parts produced with additive manufacturing can present new challenges due to the high level of process-induced distortions and unique part attributes. This paper introduces an integrated 3D scanning and process simulation data-driven framework to minimize distortions of reverse-engineered additively manufactured components. This framework employs iterative finite element simulations to predict geometric distortions to minimize errors between the predicted and measured geometrical deviations of the key dimensional characteristics of the part. The effectiveness of this approach is then demonstrated by reverse engineering two Inconel-718 components manufactured using laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing. This paper presents a remanufacturing process that combines reverse engineering and additive manufacturing, leveraging geometric feature-based part compensation through process simulation. Our approach can generate both compensated STL and parametric CAD models, eliminating laborious experimentation during reverse engineering. We evaluate the merits of STL-based and CAD-based approaches by quantifying the errors induced at the different steps of the proposed approach and analyzing the influence of varying part geometries. Using the proposed CAD-based method, the average absolute percent error between simulation-predicted distorted dimensions and actual measured dimensions of the manufactured parts was 0.087%, with better accuracy than the STL-based method."
2509.0645,"Key components of the Earth system can undergo abrupt and potentially irreversible transitions when the magnitude or rate of external forcing exceeds critical thresholds. In this study, we use the example of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) to demonstrate the challenges associated with anticipating such transitions when the system is susceptible to bifurcation-induced, rate-induced, and noise-induced tipping. Using a calibrated AMOC box model, we conduct large ensemble simulations and show that transition behavior is inherently probabilistic: under identical freshwater forcing scenarios, some ensemble members exhibit transitions while others do not. In this stochastic regime, traditional early warning indicators based on critical slowing down are unreliable in predicting impending transitions. To address this limitation, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach that identifies higher-order statistical differences between transitioning and non-transitioning trajectories within the ensemble realizations. This method enables the real-time prediction of transition probabilities for individual trajectories prior to the onset of tipping. Our results show that the CNN-based indicator provides effective early warnings in a system where transitions can be induced by bifurcations, critical forcing rates, and noise. These findings underscore the potential in identifying safe operating spaces and early warning indicators for abrupt transitions of Earth system components under uncertainty."
2509.06638,"Surrogate modeling is a powerful methodology in chemical process engineering, frequently employed to accelerate optimization tasks where traditional flowsheet simulators are computationally prohibitive. However, the state-of-the-art is dominated by surrogate models trained for a narrow range of fixed chemical systems and operating conditions, limiting their reusability. This work introduces a paradigm shift towards reusable surrogates by developing a single model for distillation columns that generalizes across a vast design space. The key enabler is a novel ML-fueled modelfluid representation which allows for the generation of datasets of more than $1,000,000$ samples. This allows the surrogate to generalize not only over column specifications but also over the entire chemical space of homogeneous ternary vapor-liquid mixtures. We validate the model's accuracy and demonstrate its practical utility in a case study on entrainer distillation, where it successfully screens and ranks candidate entrainers, significantly reducing the computational effort compared to rigorous optimization."
2509.07283,"Parameter identification for mechanistic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models underpins prediction and control in several applications, yet remains a manual and labor-intensive process: datasets are noisy and partial, models can be stiff and complex, and differentiable implementations demand framework expertise. An agentic AI workflow is presented that converts a lightweight, human-readable specification into a compiled, parallel, and differentiable model calibration pipeline. Users supply an XML description of the problem and fill in a Python code skeleton; the agent automatically validates consistency between problem definition and code, and auto-corrects pathologies in the input deck. It transforms Python callables into pure JAX functions for efficient just-in-time compilation and parallelization. The system then orchestrates a two-stage search comprising global exploration of the parameter space followed by gradient-based refinement. The result is an AD-native, reproducible workflow that lowers the barrier to advanced calibration while preserving expert control. An open-source implementation with a documented API and examples is released, enabling rapid movement from problem statement to interpretable ODE models with minimal effort."
2509.07303,"Scientific discovery drives progress across disciplines, from fundamental physics to industrial applications. However, identifying physical laws automatically from gathered datasets requires identifying the structure and parameters of the formula underlying the data, which involves navigating a vast search space and consuming substantial computational resources. To address these issues, we build on the Buckingham $\Pi$ theorem and Taylor's theorem to create a unified representation of diverse formulas, which introduces latent variables to form a two-stage structure. To minimize the search space, we initially focus on determining the structure of the latent formula, including the relevant contributing inputs, the count of latent variables, and their interconnections. Following this, the process of parameter identification is expedited by enforcing dimensional constraints for physical relevance, favoring simplicity in the formulas, and employing strategic optimization techniques. Any overly complex outcomes are refined using symbolic regression for a compact form. These general strategic techniques drastically reduce search iterations from hundreds of millions to just tens, significantly enhancing the efficiency of data-driven formula discovery. We performed comprehensive validation to demonstrate FIND's effectiveness in discovering physical laws, dimensionless numbers, partial differential equations, and uniform critical system parameters across various fields, including astronomy, physics, chemistry, and electronics. The excellent performances across 11 distinct datasets position FIND as a powerful and versatile tool for advancing data-driven scientific discovery in multiple domains."
2509.07532,"Android malware detection continues to face persistent challenges stemming from long-term concept drift and class imbalance, as evolving malicious behaviors and shifting usage patterns dynamically reshape feature distributions. Although continual learning (CL) mitigates drift, existing replay-based methods suffer from inherent bias. Specifically, their reliance on classifier uncertainty for sample selection disproportionately prioritizes the dominant benign class, causing overfitting and reduced generalization to evolving malware. To address these limitations, we propose a novel uncertainty-guided CL framework. First, we introduce a hierarchical balanced sampler that employs a dual-phase uncertainty strategy to dynamically balance benign and malicious samples while simultaneously selecting high-information, high-uncertainty instances within each class. This mechanism ensures class equilibrium across both replay and incremental data, thereby enhancing adaptability to emerging threats. Second, we augment the framework with a vector retrieval mechanism that exploits historical malware embeddings to identify evolved variants via similarity-based retrieval, thereby complementing classifier updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under strict low-label conditions (50 labels per phase). It achieves a true positive rate (TPR) of 92.95\% and a mean accuracy (mACC) of 94.26\%, which validates its efficacy for sustainable Android malware detection."
2509.07627,"Designing full-length, epitope-specific TCR {\alpha}\b{eta} remains challenging due to vast sequence space, data biases and incomplete modeling of immunogenetic constraints. We present LSMTCR, a scalable multi-architecture framework that separates specificity from constraint learning to enable de novo, epitope-conditioned generation of paired, full-length TCRs. A diffusion-enhanced BERT encoder learns time-conditioned epitope representations; conditional GPT decoders, pretrained on CDR3\b{eta} and transferred to CDR3{\alpha}, generate chain-specific CDR3s under cross-modal conditioning with temperature-controlled diversity; and a gene-aware Transformer assembles complete {\alpha}/\b{eta} sequences by predicting V/J usage to ensure immunogenetic fidelity. Across GLIPH, TEP, MIRA, McPAS and our curated dataset, LSMTCR achieves higher predicted binding than baselines on most datasets, more faithfully recovers positional and length grammars, and delivers superior, temperature-tunable diversity. For {\alpha}-chain generation, transfer learning improves predicted binding, length realism and diversity over representative methods. Full-length assembly from known or de novo CDR3s preserves k-mer spectra, yields low edit distances to references, and, in paired {\alpha}/\b{eta} co-modelling with epitope, attains higher pTM/ipTM than single-chain settings. LSMTCR outputs diverse, gene-contextualized, full-length TCR designs from epitope input alone, enabling high-throughput screening and iterative optimization."
2509.07632,"Explicit time integration for immersed finite element discretizations severely suffers from the influence of poorly cut elements. In this contribution, we propose a generalized eigenvalue stabilization (GEVS) strategy for the element mass matrices of cut elements to cure their adverse impact on the critical time step size of the global system. We use spectral basis functions, specifically $C^0$ continuous Lagrangian interpolation polynomials defined on Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) points, which, in combination with its associated GLL quadrature rule, yield high-order convergent diagonal mass matrices for uncut elements. Moreover, considering cut elements, we combine the proposed GEVS approach with the finite cell method (FCM) to guarantee definiteness of the system matrices. However, the proposed GEVS stabilization can directly be applied to other immersed boundary finite element methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the stabilization strategy achieves optimal convergence rates and recovers critical time step sizes of equivalent boundary-conforming discretizations. This also holds in the presence of weakly enforced Dirichlet boundary conditions using either Nitsche's method or penalty formulations."
2509.08137,"During hypersonic flight, air reacts with a planetary re-entry vehicle's thermal protection system (TPS), creating reaction products that deplete the TPS. Reliable assessment of TPS performance depends on accurate ablation models. New finite-rate gas-surface chemistry models are advancing state-of-the-art in TPS ablation modeling, but model reductions that omit chemical species and reactions may be necessary in some cases for computational tractability. This work develops hybrid physics-based and data-driven enrichments to improve the predictive capability and quantify uncertainties in such low-fidelity models while maintaining computational tractability. We focus on discrepancies in predicted carbon monoxide production that arise because the low-fidelity model tracks only a subset of reactions. To address this, we embed targeted enrichments into the low-fidelity model to capture the influence of omitted reactions. Numerical results show that the hybrid enrichments significantly improve predictive accuracy while requiring the addition of only three reactions."
2509.08609,"Computational modeling of contact is fundamental to many engineering applications, yet accurately and efficiently solving complex contact problems remains challenging. In this work, we propose a new contact algorithm that computes contact forces by taking the gradient of an energy function of the contact volume (overlap) with respect to the geometry descriptors. While elegant in concept, evaluating this gradient is non-trivial due to the arbitrary geometry of the contact region. Inspired by the recently proposed Fiber Monte Carlo (FMC) method, we develop an algorithm that accurately computes contact forces based on the overlap volume between bodies with complex geometries. Our computational framework operates independently of mesh conformity, eliminating the need for master-slave identification and projection iterations, thus handling arbitrary discretizations. Moreover, by removing explicit complementarity constraints, the method retains a simple structure that can be easily incorporated into existing numerical solvers, such as the finite element method. In this paper, numerical examples cover a wide range of contact scenarios, from classical small-deformation static contact to complex large-deformation dynamic contact in both two- and three-dimensional settings with nonlinear material behavior. These cases include Hertzian contact for small-deformation verification; contact between wedge- and cone-shaped bodies to assess pressure and displacement predictions at non-smooth boundaries; contact involving Neo-Hookean hyperelastic materials for evaluating nonlinear responses under finite deformation; and dynamic collision cases to examine transient behavior."
2509.08708,"Model-form uncertainty (MFU) in assumptions made during physics-based model development is widely considered a significant source of uncertainty; however, there are limited approaches that can quantify MFU in predictions extrapolating beyond available data. As a result, it is challenging to know how important MFU is in practice, especially relative to other sources of uncertainty in a model, making it difficult to prioritize resources and efforts to drive down error in model predictions. To address these challenges, we present a novel method to quantify the importance of uncertainties associated with model assumptions. We combine parameterized modifications to assumptions (called MFU representations) with grouped variance-based sensitivity analysis to measure the importance of assumptions. We demonstrate how, in contrast to existing methods addressing MFU, our approach can be applied without access to calibration data. However, if calibration data is available, we demonstrate how it can be used to inform the MFU representation, and how variance-based sensitivity analysis can be meaningfully applied even in the presence of dependence between parameters (a common byproduct of calibration)."
2509.08977,"We investigate the implications of a given symmetry of a random microstructure on the obtained effective tensor and its fluctuation in the context of thermal conductivity, and study strategies for enforcing these symmetries in postprocessing via orthogonal projectors. Within the framework of the representative volume element (RVE) method, we establish the invariance conditions for the effective tensor and its fluctuation under different symmetry groups of the microstructure. Interestingly, the symmetry of the considered cell type in the RVE method may break the ensemble symmetry and compromise the approximation of the effective properties. To rectify this issue, we introduce dedicated techniques which permit to enforce the expected symmetries in postprocessing and study the implications on the bounds for the effective properties as well as the total, the random and the systematic errors. We provide theoretical arguments that suitable projections lead to unbiased variance-reduction strategies which furthermore enforce the expected symmetries exactly. Through large-scale FFT-based homogenization simulations, we study the symmetry structure of the estimated effective conductivities and their fluctuations. Moreover, we demonstrate the power of the symmetry-projection techniques for fiber-reinforced composite microstructures of industrial scale."
2509.09796,"This study presents a multi-objective optimization framework for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, integrating artificial neural networks (ANNs) within a mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) formulation. By embedding data-driven surrogate models into the mathematical optimization structure, the proposed methodology addresses key limitations of conventional superstructure-based approaches, enabling simultaneous optimization of discrete process choices and continuous operating parameters. The framework captures variable input and output stream compositions, facilitating the joint optimization of target product composition and system design. Application to Fischer-Tropsch (FT) kerosene production demonstrates that cost-minimizing configurations under unconstrained CO2 emissions are dominated by the fossil-based autothermal reforming (ATR) route. Imposing carbon emission constraints necessitates the integration of biomass gasification and direct air capture coupled with carbon sequestration (DAC-CS), resulting in substantially reduced net emissions but higher production costs. At the zero-emission limit, hybrid configurations combining ATR and biomass gasification achieve the lowest costs (~2.38 \$/kg-kerosene), followed closely by biomass gasification-only (~2.43 \$/kg), both of which outperform the ATR-only pathway with DAC-CS (~2.65 \$/kg). In contrast, DAC-only systems relying exclusively on atmospheric CO2 and water electrolysis are prohibitively expensive (~10.8 \$/kg). The results highlight the critical role of the embedded ANNs: optimal process conditions, such as FT reactor pressure and gasification temperature, adapt to changing circumstances, consistently outperforming fixed setups and achieving up to 20% cost savings."
2509.09928,"With the rapid growth of e-commerce, online payment fraud has become increasingly complex, posing serious threats to financial security and consumer trust. Traditional detection methods often struggle to capture the intricate relational structures inherent in transactional data. This study presents a novel fraud detection framework that combines Large Language Models (LLM) with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to effectively identify fraudulent activities in e-commerce online payment transactions. A dataset of 2,840,000 transactions was collected over 14 days from major platforms such as Amazon, involving approximately 2,000 U.S.-based consumers and 30 merchants. With fewer than 6000 fraudulent instances, the dataset represents a highly imbalanced scenario. Consumers and merchants were modeled as nodes and transactions as edges to form a heterogeneous graph, upon which a GCN was applied to learn complex behavioral patterns. Semantic features extracted via GPT-4o and Tabformer were integrated with structural features to enhance detection performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.98, effectively balancing precision and sensitivity in fraud detection. This framework offers a scalable and real-time solution for securing online payment environments and provides a promising direction for applying graph-based deep learning in financial fraud prevention."
2509.09995,"Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in financial reasoning and market understanding. Multi-agent LLM frameworks such as TradingAgent and FINMEM augment these models to long-horizon investment tasks by leveraging fundamental and sentiment-based inputs for strategic decision-making. However, these approaches are ill-suited for the high-speed, precision-critical demands of High-Frequency Trading (HFT). HFT typically requires rapid, risk-aware decisions driven by structured, short-horizon signals, such as technical indicators, chart patterns, and trend features. These signals stand in sharp contrast to the long-horizon, text-driven reasoning that characterizes most existing LLM-based systems in finance. To bridge this gap, we introduce QuantAgent, the first multi-agent LLM framework explicitly designed for high-frequency algorithmic trading. The system decomposes trading into four specialized agents--Indicator, Pattern, Trend, and Risk--each equipped with domain-specific tools and structured reasoning capabilities to capture distinct aspects of market dynamics over short temporal windows. Extensive experiments across nine financial instruments, including Bitcoin and Nasdaq futures, demonstrate that QuantAgent consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher predictive accuracy at both 1-hour and 4-hour trading intervals across multiple evaluation metrics. Our findings suggest that coupling structured trading signals with LLM-based reasoning provides a viable path for traceable, real-time decision systems in high-frequency financial markets."
2509.10157,"Battery electric freight trains are crucial for decarbonization by providing zero-emission transportation alternatives. The proper adoption of battery electric freight trains depends on an efficient battery electrification strategy, involving both infrastructure setup and charge scheduling. The study presents a comprehensive model for the optimal design of charging infrastructure and charge scheduling for each train. To provide more refueling flexibility, we allow batteries to be either charged or swapped in a deployed station, and each train can carry multiple batteries. This problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model. To obtain real-time solutions for a large scale network, we develop three algorithms to solve the optimization problem: (1) a Rectangle Piecewise Linear Approximation technique, (2) a Fixed Algorithm heuristic, and (3) Benders Decomposition algorithm. In computational experiments, we use the three proposed algorithms to solve instances with up to 25 stations. Statistical analysis verifies that Benders Decomposition outperforms the other two algorithms with respect to the objective function value, closely followed by the Rectangle Piecewise Linear Approximation technique, and the Fixed Algorithm provides the least optimal solution."
2509.10185,"In this work, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is applied to active flow control (AFC) over a threedimensional SD7003 wing at a Reynolds number of Re = 60,000 and angle of attack of AoA = 14 degrees. In the uncontrolled baseline case, the flow exhibits massive separation and a fully turbulent wake. Using a GPU-accelerated CFD solver and multi-agent training, DRL discovers control strategies that enhance lift (79%), reduce drag (65%), and improve aerodynamic efficiency (408%). Flow visualizations confirm reattachment of the separated shear layer, demonstrating the potential of DRL for complex and turbulent flows."
2509.10195,"This study explores the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) to reduce flow separation on wings at high angles of attack. Concretely, here the DRL agent controls the flow over the three-dimensional NACA0012 wing section at the Reynolds number Re = 1,000 and angle of attack AoA = 20 degrees, autonomously identifying optimal control actions through real-time flow data and a reward function focused on improving aerodynamic performance. The framework integrates the GPU-accelerated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver SOD2D with the TF-Agents DRL library via a Redis in-memory database, enabling rapid training. This work builds on previous DRL flow-control studies, demonstrating DRL potential to address complex aerodynamic challenges and push the boundaries of traditional AFC methods."
2509.10272,"This paper presents TubeBEND, a real-world dataset comprising 318 rotary tube bending processes, which were collected and sorted by experts from various fields to evaluate machine learning and signal analysis methods. The dataset addresses the industrial challenge of predicting the geometry of a first-stage bend, which can be beneficial for designing machine clamping molds for the second-stage bend in two-stage rotary draw bending. Some geometry criteria, such as the tube's final bent angle (or springback) and its cross-sectional deformation, are being recorded in this dataset. This dataset gives us the possibility to build and test machine learning models that can predict the geometry and help the machine operators with a better machine setup to optimize the tube's springback and deformation. Moreover, by recording some process parameters, such as tool movements and forces or torques applied to them, we deliver detailed information about their impacts on the final tube geometry. The focus of our work is to discover solutions that can replace traditional methods, such as trial-and-error or simulation-based predictions, by including experimental process variables in ML algorithms. Our dataset is publicly available atthis https URLandthis https URLas a benchmark to improve data-driven methods in this field."
2509.10962,"Using machine learning (ML), high performance computing, and a large body of geospatial information, we develop surrogate models to predict soil liquefaction across regional scales. Two sets of models - one global and one specific to New Zealand - are trained by learning to mimic geotechnical models at the sites of in-situ tests. Our geospatial approach has conceptual advantages in that predictions: (i) are anchored to mechanics, which encourages more sensible response and scaling across the domains of soil, site, and loading characteristics; (ii) are driven by ML, which allows more predictive information to be used, with greater potential for it to be exploited; (iii) are geostatistically updated by subsurface data, which anchors the predictions to known conditions; and (iv) are precomputed everywhere on earth for all conceivable earthquakes, which allows the models to be executed very easily, thus encouraging user adoption and evaluation. Test applications suggest that: (i) the proposed models outperform others to a statistically significant degree; (ii) the geostatistical updating further improves performance; and (iii) the anticipated advantages of region-specific models may largely be negated by the benefits of learning from larger global datasets. These models are best suited for regional-scale liquefaction hazard simulation and near-real-time response and are accompanied by variance products that convey where, and to what degree, the ML-predicted liquefaction response is influenced by local geotechnical data."
2509.10965,"Recent large-magnitude earthquakes have demonstrated the damaging consequences of soil liquefaction and reinforced the need to understand and plan for liquefaction hazards at a regional scale. In the United States, the Pacific Northwest is uniquely vulnerable to such consequences given the potential for crustal, intraslab, and subduction zone earthquakes. In this study, the liquefaction hazard is predicted geospatially at high resolution and across regional scales for 85 scenario earthquakes in the states of Washington and Oregon. This is accomplished using an emergent geospatial model that is driven by machine learning, and which predicts the probability of damaging ground deformation by surrogating state-of-practice geotechnical models. The adopted model shows improved performance and has conceptual advantages over prior regional-scale modeling approaches in that predictions (i) are informed by mechanics, (ii) employ more geospatial information using machine learning, and (iii) are geostatistically anchored to known subsurface conditions. The utility of the resulting predictions for the 85 scenarios is then demonstrated via asset and network infrastructure vulnerability assessments. The liquefaction hazard forecasts are published in a GIS-ready, public repository and are suitable for disaster simulations, evacuation route planning, network vulnerability analysis, land-use planning, insurance loss modeling, hazard communication, public investment prioritization, and other regional-scale applications."
2509.10966,"Soil liquefaction remains an important and interesting problem that has attracted the development of enumerable prediction models. Increasingly, these models are utilizing algorithmic learning, or ""artificial intelligence"" (AI). The rapid growth of AI in the liquefaction literature is unsurprising, given its ease of implementation and potential advantages over traditional statistical methods. However, AI liquefaction models have been widely ignored by practitioners and researchers alike; the objective of this paper is to investigate ""why?"" Through a sample review of 75 publications, we identify several good reasons. Namely, these models frequently: (i) are not compared to state-of-practice models, making it unclear why they should be adopted; (ii) depart from best practices in model development; (iii) use AI in ways that may not be useful; (iv) are presented in ways that overstate their complexity and make them unapproachable; and (v) are discussed but not actually provided, meaning that no one can use the models even if they wanted to. These prevailing problems must be understood, identified, and remedied, but this does not mean that AI itself is problematic, or that all prior efforts have been without merit or utility. Instead, understanding these recurrent shortcomings can help improve the direction and perceptions of this growing body of work. Towards this end, we highlight papers that are generally free from these shortcomings, and which demonstrate applications where AI is more likely to provide value in the near term: permitting new modeling approaches and potentially improving predictions of liquefaction phenomena."
2509.11447,"Software development has entered a new era where large language models (LLMs) now serve as general-purpose reasoning engines, enabling natural language interaction and transformative applications across diverse domains. This paradigm is now extending into computer-aided engineering (CAE). Recent applications of LLMs in CAE have successfully automated routine tasks, including CAD model generation and FEM simulations. Nevertheless, these contributions, which primarily serve to reduce manual labor, are often insufficient for addressing the significant computational challenges posed by large-scale, high-dimensional systems. To this aim, we first introduce the concept of LLM-empowered CAE agent, where LLMs act as autonomous collaborators that plan, execute, and adapt CAE workflows. Then, we propose an LLM-empowered CAE agent for data-free model order reduction (MOR), a powerful yet underused approach for ultra-fast large-scale parametric analysis due to the intrusive nature and labor-intensive redevelopment of solvers. LLMs can alleviate this barrier by automating derivations, code restructuring, and implementation, making intrusive MOR both practical and broadly accessible. To demonstrate feasibility, we present an LLM-empowered CAE agent for solving ultra-large-scale space-parameter-time (S-P-T) physical problems using Tensor-decomposition-based A Priori Surrogates (TAPS). Our results show that natural language prompts describing parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) can be translated into efficient solver implementations, substantially reducing human effort while producing high-fidelity reduced-order models. Moreover, LLMs can synthesize novel MOR solvers for unseen cases such as nonlinear and high-dimensional parametric problems based on their internal knowledge base. This highlights the potential of LLMs to establish the foundation for next-generation CAE systems."
2509.11658,"This paper proposes a human-centered conceptual model integrating lean and Industry 4.0 based on the literature review and validated it through a case study in the context of an advanced automotive first-tier supplier.

2509.11762,"Very-low-field MRIs are becoming increasingly popular due to their portability and adaptability to different environments. They are being successfully used for various clinical applications, leading to a paradigm shift in the way imaging care is typically performed. The development of low-cost MRI scanner prototypes began a few years ago, with some interesting and promising open-source projects emerging in both hardware and software design. Using permanent magnets (PMs) to generate the static magnetic field B0 can substantially reduce the manufacturing cost of low-field scanners while achieving satisfactory homogeneity. This article focuses on characterizing magnet performance in terms of B0 spatial homogeneity. Specifically, it investigates its sensitivity to various factors and explores the reasons for discrepancies between numerical expectations and actual measurements on fabricated magnets. The analysis also examines the consequences of using different numerical model approximations, revisiting concepts most frequently used in other design contexts. While these assumptions simplify the numerical model and may improve its performance in terms of computational time, this paper demonstrates that they also impact the reliability of the obtained results."
2509.11784,"We propose a computational framework, Hetero-EUCLID, for segmentation and parameter identification to characterize the full hyperelastic behavior of all constituents of a heterogeneous material. In this work, we leverage the Bayesian-EUCLID (Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery) framework to efficiently solve the heterogenized formulation through parsimonious model selection using sparsity-promoting priors and Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling. We utilize experimentally observable 3D surface displacement and boundary-averaged force data generated from Finite Element simulations of non-equi-biaxial tension tests on heterogeneous specimens. The framework broadly consists of two steps -- residual force-based segmentation, and constitutive parameter identification. We validate and demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to segment the domain, and characterize the constituent materials on various types of thin square heterogeneous domains. We validate of the framework's ability to segment and characterize materials with various levels of displacement noises and non-native mesh discretizations, i.e, using different meshes for the forward FE simulations and the inverse EUCLID problem. This demonstrates Hetero-EUCLID framework's applicability in Digital Image/Volume Correlation-based experimental scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed framework performs successful segmentation and material characterizations based on data from a single experiment, thereby making it viable for rapid, interpretable model discovery in domains such as aerospace and defense composites and for characterization of selective tissue stiffening in medical conditions such as fibroatheroma, atherosclerosis, or cancer."
2509.11883,"In plasma edge simulations, kinetic Monte Carlo (MC) is often used to simulate neutral particles and estimate source terms. For large-sized reactors, like ITER and DEMO, high particle collision rates lead to a substantial computational cost for such schemes. To address this challenge, an asymptotic-preserving kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo (KDMC) simulation method and a corresponding fluid estimation technique have been proposed in the literature. In this work, we perform numerical analysis on the convergence of KDMC with the fluid estimation. To do so, we compare the accuracy of the analyzed algorithm with the accuracy of an approximate fluid method using the kinetic MC method as a reference. In a one-dimensional test case, KDMC with the fluid estimation achieves at least one order of magnitude lower errors than the fluid method for both high- and low-collisional regimes. Moreover, KDMC with the fluid estimation outperforms the kinetic MC method with a clear speed-up. Overall, our analysis confirms the effectiveness of the discussed algorithm."
2509.12042,"Financial disclosures such as 10-K filings present challenging retrieval problems due to their length, regulatory section hierarchy, and domain-specific language, which standard retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models underuse. We introduce FinGEAR (Financial Mapping-Guided Enhanced Answer Retrieval), a retrieval framework tailored to financial documents. FinGEAR combines a finance lexicon for Item-level guidance (FLAM), dual hierarchical indices for within-Item search (Summary Tree and Question Tree), and a two-stage cross-encoder reranker. This design aligns retrieval with disclosure structure and terminology, enabling fine-grained, query-aware context selection. Evaluated on full 10-Ks with queries aligned to the FinQA dataset, FinGEAR delivers consistent gains in precision, recall, F1, and relevancy, improving F1 by up to 56.7% over flat RAG, 12.5% over graph-based RAGs, and 217.6% over prior tree-based systems, while also increasing downstream answer accuracy with a fixed reader. By jointly modeling section hierarchy and domain lexicon signals, FinGEAR improves retrieval fidelity and provides a practical foundation for high-stakes financial analysis."
2509.12436,"Additive manufacturing (AM) allows for manufacturing of complex three-dimensional geometries not typically realizable with standard subtractive manufacturing practices. The internal microstructure of a 3D printed component can have a significant impact on its mechanical, vibrational, and shock properties and allows for a richer design space when this is controllable. Due to the complex interactions of the internal geometry of an extrusion-based AM component, it is common practice to assume a homogeneous behavior or to perform characterization testing on the specific toolpath configurations. To avoid unnecessary testing or material waste, it is necessary to develop an accurate and consistent numerical simulation framework with relevant boundary value problems that can handle the complicated geometry of internal material microstructure present in AM components. Herein, a framework is proposed to directly create computational meshes suitable for finite element analysis (FEA) of the fine-scale features generated from extrusion-based AM tool paths to maintain a strong process-structure-property-performance linkage. This mesh can be manually or automatically analyzed using standard FEA simulations such as quasi-static preloading, modal analysis, or thermal analysis. The framework allows an in-silico assessment of a target AM geometry where fine-scale features may greatly impact quantities of design interest such as in soft elastomeric lattices where toolpath infill can greatly influence the self contact of a structure in compression, which we will use as a motivating exemplar. This approach greatly reduces the waste of both time and resources consumed through traditional build and test design cycles for non-intuitive design spaces. It also further allows for the exploration of toolpath infill to optimize component properties beyond simple linear properties such as density and stiffness."
2509.12519,"Financial news plays a critical role in the information diffusion process in financial markets and is a known driver of stock prices. However, the information in each news article is not necessarily self-contained, often requiring a broader understanding of the historical news coverage for accurate interpretation. Further, identifying and incorporating the most relevant contextual information presents significant challenges. In this work, we explore the value of historical context in the ability of large language models to understand the market impact of financial news. We find that historical context provides a consistent and significant improvement in performance across methods and time horizons. To this end, we propose an efficient and effective contextualization method that uses a large LM to process the main article, while a small LM encodes the historical context into concise summary embeddings that are then aligned with the large model's representation space. We explore the behavior of the model through multiple qualitative and quantitative interpretability tests and reveal insights into the value of contextualization. Finally, we demonstrate that the value of historical context in model predictions has real-world applications, translating to substantial improvements in simulated investment performance."
2509.1255,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening condition characterized by permanent enlargement of the aorta, often detected incidentally during imaging for unrelated conditions. Current management relies primarily on aneurysm diameter and growth rate, which may not reliably predict patient-specific rupture risk. Computation of AAA wall stress and strain has the potential to improve individualized risk assessment, but these analyses depend on image-derived geometry, which is subject to segmentation uncertainty and lacks a definitive ground truth for the wall boundary. While the effect of geometric uncertainty on wall stress has been studied, its influence on wall strain remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the impact of geometric uncertainty on AAA wall strain computed using deformable image registration of time-resolved 3D computed tomography angiography (4D-CTA). Controlled perturbations were applied to the wall geometry along the surface normal, parameterized by the standard deviation for random variation and the mean for systematic inward or outward bias, both scaled relative to wall thickness. Results show that uncertainties in AAA wall geometry reduce the accuracy of computed strain, with inward bias (toward the blood lumen and intraluminal thrombus) consistently causing greater deviations than outward bias (toward regions external to the aortic wall). Peak strain is more sensitive but less robust, whereas the 99th percentile strain remains more stable under perturbations. We concluded that, for sufficiently accurate strain estimation, geometric uncertainty should remain within one wall thickness (typically 1.5 mm)."
2509.12638,"Financial sentiment analysis (FSA) has attracted significant attention, and recent studies increasingly explore large language models (LLMs) for this field. Yet most work evaluates only classification metrics, leaving unclear whether sentiment signals align with market behavior. We propose FinSentLLM, a lightweight multi-LLM framework that integrates an expert panel of sentiment forecasting LLMs, and structured semantic financial signals via a compact meta-classifier. This design captures expert complementarity, semantic reasoning signal, and agreement/divergence patterns without costly retraining, yielding consistent 3-6% gains over strong baselines in accuracy and F1-score on the Financial PhraseBank dataset. In addition, we also provide econometric evidence that financial sentiment and stock markets exhibit statistically significant long-run comovement, applying Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH (DCC-GARCH) and the Johansen cointegration test to daily sentiment scores computed from the FNSPID dataset and major stock indices. Together, these results demonstrate that FinSentLLM delivers superior forecasting accuracy for financial sentiment and further establish that sentiment signals are robustly linked to long-run equity market dynamics."
2509.14054,"Inferring parameters of high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) poses significant computational and inferential challenges, primarily due to the curse of dimensionality and the inherent limitations of traditional numerical methods. This paper introduces a novel two-stage Bayesian framework that synergistically integrates training, physics-based deep kernel learning (DKL) with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to robustly infer unknown PDE parameters and quantify their uncertainties from sparse, exact observations. The first stage leverages physics-based DKL to train a surrogate model, which jointly yields an optimized neural network feature extractor and robust initial estimates for the PDE parameters. In the second stage, with the neural network weights fixed, HMC is employed within a full Bayesian framework to efficiently sample the joint posterior distribution of the kernel hyperparameters and the PDE parameters. Numerical experiments on canonical and high-dimensional inverse PDE problems demonstrate that our framework accurately estimates parameters, provides reliable uncertainty estimates, and effectively addresses challenges of data sparsity and model complexity, offering a robust and scalable tool for diverse scientific and engineering applications."
2509.14437,"Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising machine learning approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, PINNs face significant challenges in balancing multi-objective losses, as multiple competing loss terms such as physics residuals, boundary conditions, and initial conditions must be appropriately weighted. While various loss balancing schemes have been proposed, they have been implemented within neural network architectures with fixed activation functions, and their effectiveness has been assessed using simpler PDEs. We hypothesize that the effectiveness of loss balancing schemes depends not only on the balancing strategy itself, but also on the loss function design and the neural network's inherent function approximation capabilities, which are influenced by the choice of activation function. In this paper, we extend existing solutions by incorporating trainable activation functions within the neural network architecture and evaluate the proposed approach on complex fluid flow applications modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations. Our evaluation across diverse Navier-Stokes problems demonstrates that this proposed solution achieves root mean square error (RMSE) improvements ranging from 7.4% to 95.2% across different scenarios. These findings highlight the importance of carefully designing the loss function and selecting activation functions for effective loss balancing."
2509.14586,"Data assimilation (DA) integrates observational data with numerical models to improve the prediction of complex physical systems. However, traditional DA methods often struggle with nonlinear dynamics and multi-scale variability, particularly when implemented directly in the physical domain. To address these challenges, this work develops an Eulerian Data Assimilation (EuDA) method with the Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear System (CGNS). The proposed approach enables the treatment of systems with non-periodic boundaries and provides a more intuitive representation of localized and time-dependent phenomena. The work considers a simplified physical domain inspired by sea-ice floe trajectories and ocean eddy recovery in the Arctic regions, where the dynamics are modeled by a two-layer quasi-geostrophic (QG) system. The QG equations are numerically solved using forward-Euler time stepping and centered finite-difference schemes. CGNS provides a nonlinear filter as it offers an analytical and continuous formulation for filtering a nonlinear system. Model performance is assessed using normalized root mean square error (RMSE) and pattern correlation (Corr) of the posterior mean. The results show that both metrics improve monotonically with refining timesteps, while RMSE converges to approximately 0.1, which is the noise strength, and Corr increases from 0.64 to 0.92 as the grid resolution becomes finer. Lastly, a coupled scenario with sea-ice particles advected by the two-layer QG flow under a linear drag force is examined, demonstrating the flexibility of the EuDA-CGNS framework in capturing coupled ice-ocean interactions. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of exploiting the two-layer QG model in the physical domain to capture multiscale flow features."
2509.14976,"Purpose: To model and predict the dynamics of conductive nonmagnetic objects within the MRI room under the influence of Lenz effect. Methods: The dynamics are described by an ordinary differential equation and the Lenz effect approximated by recognizing that the skin effect is negligible. This separated Lenz effect dependency on the object position and velocity, leading to a simple numerical procedure for objects of any shape. Results: The model and numerical procedure were validated with experimental data recording the rotation of an aluminum plate falling inside a 1.5 T MRI scanner. The model was also applied for studying the translation of an aluminum plate pushed with constant force towards the MRI bore through the fringe field. Conclusion: The collected results showed that it is possible to obtain accurate predictions of motion in the presence of Lenz effect by neglecting the skin effect while determining the electric currents induced in the metallic object during each infinitesimal motion step."
2509.14994,"Dynamic time warping (DTW) is widely used to align time series evolving on mismatched timescales, yet most applications reduce alignment to a scalar distance. We introduce warp quantification analysis (WQA), a framework that derives interpretable geometric and structural descriptors from DTW paths. Controlled simulations showed that each metric selectively tracked its intended driver with minimal crosstalk. Applied to large-scale fMRI, WQA revealed distinct network signatures and complementary associations with schizophrenia negative symptom severity, capturing clinically meaningful variability beyond DTW distance. WQA transforms DTW from a single-score method into a family of alignment descriptors, offering a principled and generalizable extension for richer characterization of temporal coupling across domains where nonlinear normalization is essential."
2509.15414,"Prediction of stock price movements presents a formidable challenge in financial analytics due to the inherent volatility, non-stationarity, and nonlinear characteristics of market data. This paper introduces SPH-Net (Stock Price Prediction Hybrid Neural Network), an innovative deep learning framework designed to enhance the accuracy of time series forecasting in financial markets. The proposed architecture employs a novel co-attention mechanism that initially processes temporal patterns through a Vision Transformer, followed by refined feature extraction via an attention mechanism, thereby capturing both global and local dependencies in market data. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments on eight diverse stock datasets: AMD, Ebay, Facebook, FirstService Corp, Tesla, Google, Mondi ADR, and Matador Resources. Each dataset is standardized using six fundamental market indicators: Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume, representing a complete set of features for comprehensive market analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that SPH-Net consistently outperforms existing stock prediction models across all evaluation metrics. The model's superior performance stems from its ability to effectively capture complex temporal patterns while maintaining robustness against market noise. By significantly improving prediction accuracy in financial time series analysis, SPH-Net provides valuable decision-support capabilities for investors and financial analysts, potentially enabling more informed investment strategies and risk assessment in volatile market conditions."
2509.15744,"Dynamic optimization is currently limited by sensitivity computations that require information from full forward and adjoint wave fields. Since the forward and adjoint solutions are computed in opposing time directions, the forward solution must be stored. This requires a substantial amount of memory for large-scale problems even when using check pointing or data compression techniques. As a result, the problem size is memory bound rather than bound by wall clock time, when working with modern GPU-based implementations that have limited memory capacity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new approach for approximate sensitivity computation based on the adjoint method (for self-adjoint problems) that relies on the principle of superposition. The approximation allows an iterative computation of the sensitivity, reducing the memory burden to that of the solution at a small number of time steps, i.e., to the number of degrees of freedom. This enables sensitivity computations for problems with billions of degrees of freedom on current GPUs, such as the A100 from NVIDIA (from 2020). We demonstrate the approach on full waveform inversion and transient acoustic topology optimization problems, relying on a highly efficient finite difference forward solver implemented in CUDA. Phenomena such as damping cannot be considered, as the approximation technique is limited to self-adjoint problems."
2509.15909,"This paper presents the simulation of the operation of an electric forklift fleet within an intralogistics scenario. For this purpose, the open source simulation tool CARLA is used; according to our knowledge this is a novel approach in the context of logistics simulation. First, CARLA is used to generate and visualize a realistic 3D outdoor warehouse scenario, incorporating a number of randomly moving forklifts. In a next step, intralogistics transport tasks, such as pick-and-place, are simulated for the forklift fleet, including shortest-path finding. Furthermore, the capability to play back localization data, previously recorded from a ''real'' forklift fleet, isthis http URLplay back is done in the original recreated environment, thereby enabling the visualization of the forklifts movements. Finally, the energy consumption of the forklift trucks is simulated by integrating a physical battery model that generates the state of charge (SOC) of each truck as a function of load and activity. To demonstrate the wide range of possible applications for the CARLA simulation platform, we describe two use cases. The first deals with the problem of detecting regions with critically high traffic densities, the second with optimal placement of charging stations for the forklift trucks. Both use cases are calculated for an exemplary warehouse model."
2509.15961,"We optimize the path of a mobile sensor to minimize the posterior uncertainty of a Bayesian inverse problem. Along its path, the sensor continuously takes measurements of the state, which is a physical quantity modeled as the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) with uncertain parameters. Considering linear PDEs specifically, we derive the closed-form expression of the posterior covariance matrix of the model parameters as a function of the path, and formulate the optimal experimental design problem for minimizing the posterior's uncertainty. We discretize the problem such that the cost function remains consistent under temporal refinement. Additional constraints ensure that the path avoids obstacles and remains physically interpretable through a control parameterization. The constrained optimization problem is solved using an interior-point method. We present computational results for a convection-diffusion equation with unknown initial condition."
2509.16204,"Modern engineering, spanning electrical, mechanical, aerospace, civil, and computer disciplines, stands as a cornerstone of human civilization and the foundation of our society. However, engineering design poses a fundamentally different challenge for large language models (LLMs) compared with traditional textbook-style problem solving or factual question answering. Although existing benchmarks have driven progress in areas such as language understanding, code synthesis, and scientific problem solving, real-world engineering design demands the synthesis of domain knowledge, navigation of complex trade-offs, and management of the tedious processes that consume much of practicing engineers' time. Despite these shared challenges across engineering disciplines, no benchmark currently captures the unique demands of engineering design work. In this work, we introduce EngDesign, an Engineering Design benchmark that evaluates LLMs' abilities to perform practical design tasks across nine engineering domains. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on factual recall or question answering, EngDesign uniquely emphasizes LLMs' ability to synthesize domain knowledge, reason under constraints, and generate functional, objective-oriented engineering designs. Each task in EngDesign represents a real-world engineering design problem, accompanied by a detailed task description specifying design goals, constraints, and performance requirements. EngDesign pioneers a simulation-based evaluation paradigm that moves beyond textbook knowledge to assess genuine engineering design capabilities and shifts evaluation from static answer checking to dynamic, simulation-driven functional verification, marking a crucial step toward realizing the vision of engineering Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)."
2509.16206,"Deep reinforcement learning has shown promise in trade execution, yet its use in low-frequency factor portfolio construction remains under-explored. A key obstacle is the high-dimensional, unbalanced state space created by stocks that enter and exit the investable universe. We introduce Conditional Auto-encoded Factor-based Portfolio Optimisation (CAFPO), which compresses stock-level returns into a small set of latent factors conditioned on 94 firm-specific characteristics. The factors feed a DRL agent implemented with both PPO and DDPG to generate continuous long-short weights. On 20 years of U.S. equity data (2000--2020), CAFPO outperforms equal-weight, value-weight, Markowitz, vanilla DRL, and Fama--French-driven DRL, delivering a 24.6\% compound return and a Sharpe ratio of 0.94 out of sample. SHAP analysis further reveals economically intuitive factor attributions. Our results demonstrate that factor-aware representation learning can make DRL practical for institutional, low-turnover portfolio management."
2509.16207,"This study seeks to improve the throughput rates for shipping container terminals. In the United States, shipping ports link the domestic economy to global markets and are vital to sustain supply chain flow and economic stability. Maritime shipping accounts for nearly half of the U.S.'s annual international trade, two thirds of which are represented by container shipping. Previous studies highlighted the capability of automation in enhancing container processing; however, unlike in European and East Asian ports, full automation is limited in U.S. ports due to legal protections for human labor. Consequently, there is a need for alternative methods that deliver automation level efficiencies while maintaining the terms of cooperative agreements. This paper proposes an Intelligent Planning System (IPS) that applies the concept of Pareto Optimization to container yards through a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based recursive appointment system. The results show an improvement from baseline for both daily terminal throughput volumes and processing times. The generated IPS can be employed to provide recommendations for container positioning and truck pickup appointments to optimize container yard layout and flow resulting in reduced realtime congestion and predictively mitigated future congestion."
2509.16208,"Design-build bridge contracts often include long-term service life requirements, but there are no clear technical guidelines or standardized methods to achieve or verify these goals. While durability practices are commonly applied, they lack quantitative validation. With many aging bridges and limited financial resources, accurately estimating remaining service life is essential for prioritizing repair and rehabilitation needs. This research reviews current practices and recent advancements in bridge service life prediction, providing practical guidance for evaluating and extending the lifespan of both existing and new structures. The findings support more efficient use of maintenance funds, better understanding of deterioration models and inspection methods, and informed strategies to ensure long-term structural performance."
2509.16209,"In many industries, the scale and complexity of systems can present significant barriers to the development of accurate digital twin models. This paper introduces a novel methodology and a modular computational tool utilizing machine learning and dimensional analysis to establish a framework for scaling digital twin models. Scaling techniques have not yet been applied to digital twin technology, but they can eliminate the need for repetitive physical calibration of such models in industries where product lines include a variety of sizes of the same or similar products. In many cases, it may be easier or more cost-effective to perform physical calibration of the digital twin model on smaller units of a product line. Scaling techniques can then allow adapting the calibration data from the smaller units to other sizes of the product line without the need for additional data collection and experimentation for calibration. Conventional application of dimensional analysis for scaling in this context introduces several challenges due to distortion of scaling factors. This paper addresses these challenges and introduces a framework for proper scaling of digital twin models. The results are applied to scaling the models between an industrial-size wheel loader vehicle used in construction to a miniaturized system instrumented in a laboratory setting."
2509.1621,"A reduced order asymptotic homogenization based multiscale technique which can capture damage and inelastic effects in composite materials is proposed. This technique is based on two scale homogenization procedure where eigen strain representation accounts for the inelastic response and the computational efforts are alleviated by reduction of order technique. Macroscale stress is derived by calculating the influence tensors from the analysis of representative volume element (RVE). At microscale, the damage in the material is modeled using continuum damage mechanics (CDM) based framework. To solve the problem of strain localization a method of the alteration of stress-strain relation of micro constituents based on the dissipated fracture energy in a crack band is implemented. The issue of spurious post failure artificial stiffness at macroscale is discussed and effect of increasing the order to alleviate this problem is checked. Verification studies demonstrated the proposed formulation predicts the macroscale response and also captures the damage and plasticity induced inelastic strains."
2509.16211,"This paper describes a novel homogenization methodology for analyzing the failure of elastoplastic composite materials based on elastic and eigen influence tensors-driven transformation field analysis ($\mathtt{E}^2$-TFA). The proposed technique considers the microscopic eigenstrain field accounting for intra-phase damage and inelastic strains. This results in realistic computations by alleviating the post-damage stiffness response, which is a drawback of TFA-based methods. We attain computational efficiency by identifying the preprocessing data solely from the elastic and eigen transformation functions and adopting a reduced order modelling technique with a piecewise constant eigenstrain field throughout the subdomains. The performance of the model is assessed by simulating the response for (a) the representative volume element (RVE) as a homogenized continuum and (b) the various composites under complex load histories with intricate macroscale morphologies. Furthermore, the nonlinear shear stress-strain response of a glass fiber composite is calculated and compared to experimentally measured fracture initiation parameters, failure plane orientation, and strain histories. Finally, we show that $\mathtt{E}^2$-TFA can accurately and efficiently capture damage and inelastic deformations in order to estimate the mechanical response of composite materials in a better way."
2509.16214,"The sensitivity of structural dynamic characteristics related to eigenmode (such as modal assurance criteria, modal flexibility, and modal mass etc.) has become a crucial and widely applied tool across various engineering fields. In this paper, a novel strategy is proposed for solving the sensitivity of structural dynamic characteristics related to eigenmode with respect to multiple variables. First, an algebraic method for computing the sensitivity of eigenvectors is developed to simplify the expression for sensitivity calculations. Subsequently, based on this new expression for eigenmode sensitivity, a framework for sensitivity analysis of structural dynamic characteristics related to eigenmodes with multiple parameters is established. With the incorporation of a preconditioning iterative method, the new computational framework effectively enhances the computational efficiency of sensitivity analysis for structural characteristics related to eigenmodes with multiple parameters. This framework is easy to operate and effectively reduces the ""Fill-in"" operations of sparse matrices. Three numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The result shows that the novel strategy can significantly reduce central processing unit (CPU) computational time."
2509.16216,"A critical issue that affects engineers trying to assess the structural integrity of various infrastructures, such as metal rods or acoustic ducts, is the challenge of detecting internal fractures (defects). Traditionally, engineers depend on audible and visual aids to identify these fractures, as they do not physically dissect the object in question into multiple pieces to check for inconsistencies. This research introduces ideas towards the development of a robust strategy to image such defects using only a small set of minimal, non-invasive measurements.Assuming a one dimensional model (e.g. longitudinal waves in long and thin rods/acoustic ducts or transverse vibrations of strings), we make use of the continuous one-dimensional wave equation to model these physical phenomena and then employ specialized mathematical analysis tools (the Laplace transform and optimization) to introduce our defect imaging ideas. In particular, we will focus on the case of a long bar which is homogeneous throughout except in a small area where a defect in its Young's modulus is present. We will first demonstrate how the problem is equivalent to a spring-mass vibrational system, and then show how our imaging strategy makes use of the Laplace domain analytic map between the characteristics of the respective defect and the measurement data.More explicitly, we will utilize MATLAB (a platform for numerical computations) to collect synthetic data (computational alternative to real world measurements) for several scenarios with one defect of arbitrary location and stiffness. Subsequently, we will use this data along with our analytically developed map (between defect characteristics and measurements) to construct a residual function which, once optimized, will reveal the location and magnitude of the stiffness defect."
2509.16219,"Transient simulation of linear and nonlinear circuits remains an important task in modern EDA tools. At present, SPICE-like simulators face challenges in parallelization, nonlinear convergence and linear efficiency, especially when applied to large-scale circuits. To address the limitations of simulators in handling various nonlinear circuits, we adopt a generalized row-echelon regularization approach, which extends the applicability of exponential integrators to a broader class of differential algebraic equations. The proposed method employs matrix exponential vector products to integrate the regularized system, allowing for a larger time step size while preserving accuracy and stability. Furthermore, in order to accelerate GMRES-based solvers within Newton-Raphson iterations, a structured block-Jacobi preconditioner is designed for linear systems. For locally coupled circuits, Additive Schwarz overlapping strategy is adopted to enhance the solution performance. Numerical experiments of various nonlinear circuit models show that under same hardware environment, our method achieves a speedup of 1.95$\times$-- 3.27$\times$ in total computation time compared to Backward Euler with Inexact Newton iterations, and time steps have decreased by an average of 60.70\% (up to 74.59\%). Compared with EI-NK method, total computing time of our method has a speedup of 1.08$\times$-- 1.79$\times$. These results highlight the potential of proposed method for scalable and nonlinear circuit simulation."
2509.16222,"This data set descriptor introduces a structured, high-resolution dataset of transient thermal simulations for a vertical axis of a machine tool test rig. The data set includes temperature and heat flux values recorded at 29 probe locations at 1800 time steps, sampled every second over a 30-minute range, across 17 simulation runs derived from a fractional factorial design. First, a computer-aided design model was de-featured, segmented, and optimized, followed by finite element (FE) modelling. Detailed information on material, mesh, and boundary conditions is included. To support research and model development, the dataset provides summary statistics, thermal evolution plots, correlation matrix analyses, and a reproducible Jupyter notebook. The data set is designed to support machine learning and deep learning applications in thermal modelling for prediction, correction, and compensation of thermally induced deviations in mechanical systems, and aims to support researchers without FE expertise by providing ready-to-use simulation data."
2509.16225,"In fields such as material design or biomedicine, fiber materials play an important role. Fiber simulations, also called digital twins, provide a basis for testing and optimizing the material's physical behavior digitally. Inter-fiber contacts can influence the thermal and mechanical behavior of a fiber system; to our knowledge, however, there exist no parametric fiber models allowing for explicit modeling of the number of inter-fiber contacts. Therefore, this paper proposes an extension of the iterative force-biased fiber packing by Altendorf \& Jeulin. In this extension, we model the inter-fiber contacts explicitly and add another force to the force-biased packing to increase the number of contacts. We successfully validate the packing with respect to its parameter accuracy. Moreover, we show that the extension indeed increases the number of contacts, even exceeding theoretical values. Hence, this packing scheme has the potential to achieve higher accuracy in physical simulations."
2509.16616,"Identifying risky traders with high profits in financial markets is crucial for market makers, such as trading exchanges, to ensure effective risk management through real-time decisions on regulation compliance and hedging. However, capturing the complex and dynamic behaviours of individual traders poses significant challenges. Traditional classification and anomaly detection methods often establish a fixed risk boundary, failing to account for this complexity and dynamism. To tackle this issue, we propose a profit-aware risk ranker (PA-RiskRanker) that reframes the problem of identifying risky traders as a ranking task using Learning-to-Rank (LETOR) algorithms. Our approach features a Profit-Aware binary cross entropy (PA-BCE) loss function and a transformer-based ranker enhanced with a self-cross-trader attention pipeline. These components effectively integrate profit and loss (P&L) considerations into the training process while capturing intra- and inter-trader relationships. Our research critically examines the limitations of existing deep learning-based LETOR algorithms in trading risk management, which often overlook the importance of P&L in financial scenarios. By prioritising P&L, our method improves risky trader identification, achieving an 8.4% increase in F1 score compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) ranking models like Rankformer. Additionally, it demonstrates a 10%-17% increase in average profit compared to all benchmark models."
2509.17305,"T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes is fundamental to adaptive immunity and central to the development of T cell-based immunotherapies. While transformer-based models have shown promise in predicting TCR-pMHC interactions, most lack a systematic and explainable approach to architecture design. We present an approach that uses a new post-hoc explainability method to inform the construction of a novel encoder-decoder transformer model. By identifying the most informative combinations of TCR and epitope sequence inputs, we optimize cross-attention strategies, incorporate auxiliary training objectives, and introduce a novel early-stopping criterion based on explanation quality. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance while simultaneously improving explainability, robustness, and generalization. This work establishes a principled, explanation-driven strategy for modeling TCR-pMHC binding and offers mechanistic insights into sequence-level binding behavior through the lens of deep learning."
2509.17313,"Decoding visual signals holds the tantalizing potential to unravel the complexities of cognition and perception. While recent studies have focused on reconstructing visual stimuli from neural recordings to bridge brain activity with visual imagery, existing methods offer limited insights into the underlying mechanisms of visual processing in the brain. To mitigate this gap, we present an \textit{i}nsightful \textbf{M}ulti-subject \textbf{I}nvariant \textbf{N}eural \textbf{D}ecoding ($i$MIND) model, which employs a novel dual-decoding framework--both biometric and semantic decoding--to offer neural interpretability in a data-driven manner and deepen our understanding of brain-based visual functionalities. Our $i$MIND model operates through three core steps: establishing a shared neural representation space across subjects using a ViT-based masked autoencoder, disentangling neural features into complementary subject-specific and object-specific components, and performing dual decoding to support both biometric and semantic classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that $i$MIND achieves state-of-the-art decoding performance with minimal scalability limitations. Furthermore, $i$MIND empirically generates voxel-object activation fingerprints that reveal object-specific neural patterns and enable investigation of subject-specific variations in attention to identical stimuli. These findings provide a foundation for more interpretable and generalizable subject-invariant neural decoding, advancing our understanding of the voxel semantic selectivity as well as the neural vision processing dynamics."
2509.1914,"Particle-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of neutral particles is one of the major computational bottlenecks in tokamak scrape-off layer simulations. This computational cost comes from the need to resolve individual collision events in high-collisional regimes. However, in such regimes, one can approximate the high-collisional kinetic dynamics with computationally cheaper diffusion. Asymptotic-preserving schemes make use of this limit to perform simulations in these regimes, without a blow-up in computational cost as incurred by standard kinetic approaches. One such scheme is Kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo. In this paper, we present a first extension of this scheme to the two-dimensional setting and its implementation in the Eiron particle code. We then demonstrate that this implementation produces a significant speedup over kinetic simulations in high-collisional cases."
2509.19202,"This entry description proposes AlloyInter, a novel system to enable joint exploration of input mixtures and output parameters space in the context of the SciVis Contest 2025. We propose an interpolation approach, guided by eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) based on a learned model ensemble that allows users to discover input mixture ratios by specifying output parameter goals that can be iteratively adjusted and improved towards a goal. We strengthen the capabilities of our system by building upon prior research within the robustness of XAI, as well as combining well-established techniques like manifold learning with interpolation approaches."
2509.19564,"Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) has shown promise as an inexpensive, ubiquitous, and non-invasive screening tool to detect left ventricular systolic dysfunction in pediatric congenital heart disease. However, current approaches rely heavily on large-scale labeled datasets, which poses a major obstacle to the democratization of AI in hospitals where only limited pediatric ECG data are available. In this work, we propose a robust training framework to improve AI-ECG performance under low-resource conditions. Specifically, we introduce an on-manifold adversarial perturbation strategy for pediatric ECGs to generate synthetic noise samples that better reflect real-world signal variations. Building on this, we develop an uncertainty-aware adversarial training algorithm that is architecture-agnostic and enhances model robustness. Evaluation on the real-world pediatric dataset demonstrates that our method enables low-cost and reliable detection of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, highlighting its potential for deployment in resource-limited clinical settings."
2509.19628,"Text and time series data offer complementary views of financial markets: news articles provide narrative context about company events, while stock prices reflect how markets react to those events. However, despite their complementary nature, effectively integrating these interleaved modalities for improved forecasting remains challenging. In this work, we propose a unified neural architecture that models these interleaved sequences using modality-specific experts, allowing the model to learn unique time series patterns, while still enabling joint reasoning across modalities and preserving pretrained language understanding capabilities. To further improve multimodal understanding, we introduce a cross-modal alignment framework with a salient token weighting mechanism that learns to align representations across modalities with a focus on the most informative tokens. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large-scale financial forecasting task, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide variety of strong unimodal and multimodal baselines. We develop an interpretability method that reveals insights into the value of time series-context and reinforces the design of our cross-modal alignment objective. Finally, we demonstrate that these improvements translate to meaningful economic gains in investment simulations."
2509.20011,"A novel homogenization methodology is proposed for analyzing the failure of fiber-reinforced composite materials, utilizing elastic and eigen influence tensors within a damage informed transformation field analysis (D-TFA) framework. This approach includes a technique for calculating macroscopic damage under uniform stress and strain conditions, offering more realistic simulations. Computational efficiency is enhanced through a reduced-order modeling strategy, while elastic and eigen strain distribution driven k-means clustering methods are employed to partition the microscale domain. The model's performance is assessed by simulating the response of a representative volume element (RVE) treated as a homogenized continuum. Subsequently, a comparative assessment is carried out to check the efficacy of two clustering schemes. Damage morphologies are calculated using proposed framework and compared with predictions obtained using finite element method. Furthermore, open-hole specimen tests are simulated and failure paths are predicted for the domains with different fiber layups. Ultimately, we show that D-TFA can accurately capture damage patterns and directional strengths, providing improved predictions of the mechanical behavior of composite materials. It has been demonstrated that higher cluster counts are crucial for capturing a more accurate stress-strain response, especially for complex microstructures."
2509.20161,"The buildings and construction sector is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, with cement production alone contributing 7~\% of global emissions and the industry as a whole accounting for approximately 37~\%. Reducing emissions by optimizing structural design can achieve significant global benefits. This article introduces an efficient multi-objective constrained Bayesian optimization approach to address this challenge. Rather than attempting to determine the full set of non-dominated solutions with arbitrary trade-offs, the approach searches for a solution matching a specified trade-off. Structural design is typically conducted using computationally expensive finite element simulations, whereas Bayesian optimization offers an efficient approach for optimizing problems that involve such high-cost simulations. The proposed method integrates proper orthogonal decomposition for dimensionality reduction of simulation results with Kriging partial least squares to enhance efficiency. Constrained expected improvement is used as an acquisition function for Bayesian optimization. The approach is demonstrated through a case study of a two-lane, three-span post-tensioned concrete bridge girder, incorporating fifteen design variables and nine constraints. A comparison with conventional design methods demonstrates the potential of this optimization approach to achieve substantial cost reductions, with savings of approximately 10\% to 15\% in financial costs and about 20\% in environmental costs for the case study, while ensuring structural integrity."
2509.20542,"Structural prediction of protein-protein interactions is important to understand the molecular basis of cellular interactions, but it still faces major challenges when significant conformational changes are present. We propose a generative framework of hierarchical adaptive diffusion to improve accuracy and efficiency in such cases. It is hierarchical in separating global inter-protein rigid-body motions and local intra-protein flexibility in diffusion processes, and the distinct local and global noise schedules are designed to mimic the induced-fit effect. It is adaptive in conditioning the local flexibility schedule on predicted levels of conformational change, allowing faster flexing for larger anticipated conformational changes. Furthermore, it couples the local and global diffusion processes through a common score and confidence network with sequence, evolution, structure, and dynamics features as inputs, and maintains rotational or translational invariance or equivariance in outputs. It builds on our newly curated DIPS-AF dataset of nearly 39,000 examples for pre-training. Experiments on the independent docking benchmark dataset DB5.5 show that our model outperforms an AlphaFold2-like iterative transformer (GeoDock) and a diffusion model (DiffDock-PP) in both rigid and flexible cases, with larger improvements in more flexible cases. Ablation studies prove the importance of adaptive schedules, dynamics features, and pre-training. Additional analyses and case studies reveal remaining gaps in sampling, scoring, and conformational resolution."
2509.20713,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are important tools for reasoning and problem-solving, while they often operate passively, answering questions without actively discovering new ones. This limitation reduces their ability to simulate human-like thinking, where noticing differences is a key trigger for reasoning. Thus, in this paper we propose a difference-guided reasoning framework, which enables LLMs to identify and act upon changes across time and space. The model formalizes differences through feature extraction, prioritizes the most impactful and latest changes, and links them to appropriate actions. We further extend the framework with mechanisms for abnormal behavior detection and the integration of external information from users or sensors, ensuring more reliable and grounded reasoning. Verification results show that prompting LLMs with differences improves focus on critical issues, leading to higher alignment with desired reasoning outcomes compared to direct prompting."
2509.2077,"Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short, small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to 16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models."
2509.20911,"Graph neural networks have shown promising results in weather forecasting, which is critical for human activity such as agriculture planning and extreme weather preparation. However, most studies focus on finite and local areas for training, overlooking the influence of broader areas and limiting their ability to generalize effectively. Thus, in this work, we study global weather forecasting that is irregularly distributed and dynamically varying in practice, requiring the model to generalize to unobserved locations. To address such challenges, we propose a general Mesh Interpolation Graph Network (MIGN) that models the irregular weather station forecasting, consisting of two key designs: (1) learning spatially irregular data with regular mesh interpolation network to align the data; (2) leveraging parametric spherical harmonics location embedding to further enhance spatial generalization ability. Extensive experiments on an up-to-date observation dataset show that MIGN significantly outperforms existing data-driven models. Besides, we show that MIGN has spatial generalization ability, and is capable of generalizing to previous unseen stations."
2509.21152,"Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) form a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, processing token trades worth billions of dollars daily. Yet, a significant fraction of these trades are suboptimal: alternative routing paths could yield more target tokens. Addressing this inefficiency is both practically urgent and theoretically compelling. Building on the linear line-graph-based routing method of Zhang et al. (2025), we propose three key extensions that better capture real-world trading complexity. First, we introduce a breadth-first search (BFS) link iteration rule that reduces computational cost and average execution time without sacrificing profitability. Second, we design a route-splitting strategy that divides large trades into smaller ones, alleviating price slippage and increasing average trader profits, albeit at the cost of higher computational overhead. Third, we generalize the method beyond a single DEX to a multi-DEX aggregator setting, reflecting actual trading environments. Using empirical data from Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap V2, we demonstrate that these extensions substantially improve both computational efficiency and profitability, establishing a foundation for future routing enhancements."
2509.21493,"We propose Sci2Pol-Bench and Sci2Pol-Corpus, the first benchmark and training dataset for evaluating and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on policy brief generation from a scientific paper. We build Sci2Pol-Bench on a five-stage taxonomy to mirror the human writing process: (i) Autocompletion, (ii) Understanding, (iii) Summarization, (iv) Generation, and (v) Verification. It features 18 tasks in multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Specifically, for the Generation stage, we show that BERTScore and ROUGE scores fail to capture the quality of brief writing, and introduce a new LLM-based evaluation metric aligned with expert judgement. Using this benchmark, we evaluate 13 leading open-source and commercial LLMs to uncover key limitations. To improve LLM performance on brief writing, we curate the Sci2Pol-Corpus for fine-tuning. We start by linking each cited scientific paper to its corresponding policy document, drawn from 5.6 million policy records. This produces 140,000 candidate pairs. We then employ an LLM-as-a-judge to filter high-quality examples, followed by in-context polishing using three expert-written samples as references. This process yields a final set of 639 new pairs. Finally, we fine-tune three models on Sci2Pol-Corpus: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-12B, and Gemma-27B. Fine-tuning leads to consistent performance improvements across Sci2Pol-Bench. Notably, after fine-tuning, Gemma-27B surpasses the much larger GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 (671B). These demonstrate the effectiveness of our corpus in bridging the gap between science and policy."
2509.21507,"Quantitative research increasingly relies on unstructured financial content such as filings, earnings calls, and research notes, yet existing LLM and RAG pipelines struggle with point-in-time correctness, evidence attribution, and integration into research workflows. To tackle this, We present QuantMind, an intelligent knowledge extraction and retrieval framework tailored to quantitative finance. QuantMind adopts a two-stage architecture: (i) a knowledge extraction stage that transforms heterogeneous documents into structured knowledge through multi-modal parsing of text, tables, and formulas, adaptive summarization for scalability, and domain-specific tagging for fine-grained indexing; and (ii) an intelligent retrieval stage that integrates semantic search with flexible strategies, multi-hop reasoning across sources, and knowledge-aware generation for auditable outputs. A controlled user study demonstrates that QuantMind improves both factual accuracy and user experience compared to unaided reading and generic AI assistance, underscoring the value of structured, domain-specific context engineering for finance."
2509.21556,"Global food systems must deliver nutritious and sustainable foods while sharply reducing environmental impact. Yet, food innovation remains slow, empirical, and fragmented. Artificial intelligence (AI) now offers a transformative path with the potential to link molecular composition to functional performance, bridge chemical structure to sensory outcomes, and accelerate cross-disciplinary innovation across the entire production pipeline. Here we outline AI for Food as an emerging discipline that integrates ingredient design, formulation development, fermentation and production, texture analysis, sensory properties, manufacturing, and recipe generation. Early successes demonstrate how AI can predict protein performance, map molecules to flavor, and tailor consumer experiences. But significant challenges remain: lack of standardization, scarce multimodal data, cultural and nutritional diversity, and low consumer confidence. We propose three priorities to unlock the field: treating food as a programmable biomaterial, building self-driving laboratories for automated discovery, and developing deep reasoning models that integrate sustainability and human health. By embedding AI responsibly into the food innovation cycle, we can accelerate the transition to sustainable protein systems and chart a predictive, design-driven science of food for our own health and the health of our planet."
2509.22,"Electromagnetic analysis of antennas embedded in or interacting with large surrounding structures poses inherent multiscale challenges: the antenna is electrically small yet geometrically detailed, while the environment is electrically large but comparatively smooth. To address this, we present a hybrid method of moments (MoM) and generalized scattering matrix (GSM) framework that achieves a clean separation between fine-scale and large-scale complexities while preserving their full mutual coupling. Antennas of arbitrary geometry can be characterized once and reused across different environments, or conversely, a given environment can be modeled once to accommodate multiple antenna designs. The framework is inherently versatile, encompassing GSM-PO and GSM + T-matrix extensions, and thus provides a unified paradigm for multiscale antenna modeling. With the large body always represented by the formulation best suited to its scale and shape, the approach combines accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability. Numerical validations on implantable antennas, radome-protected arrays, and reflector systems confirm excellent agreement with full-wave solvers while demonstrating dramatic reductions in computational cost for design and optimization."
2509.22583,"Deep learning has emerged as a pivotal tool for accelerating research in the life sciences, with the low-level processing of biomedical images (e.g., registration, fusion, restoration, super-resolution) being one of its most critical applications. Platforms such as ImageJ (Fiji) and napari have enabled the development of customized plugins for various models. However, these plugins are typically based on models that are limited to specific tasks and datasets, making them less practical for biologists. To address this challenge, we introduce Orochi, the first application-oriented, efficient, and versatile image processor designed to overcome these limitations. Orochi is pre-trained on patches/volumes extracted from the raw data of over 100 publicly available studies using our Random Multi-scale Sampling strategy. We further propose Task-related Joint-embedding Pre-Training (TJP), which employs biomedical task-related degradation for self-supervision rather than relying on Masked Image Modelling (MIM), which performs poorly in downstream tasks such as registration. To ensure computational efficiency, we leverage Mamba's linear computational complexity and construct Multi-head Hierarchy Mamba. Additionally, we provide a three-tier fine-tuning framework (Full, Normal, and Light) and demonstrate that Orochi achieves comparable or superior performance to current state-of-the-art specialist models, even with lightweight parameter-efficient options. We hope that our study contributes to the development of an all-in-one workflow, thereby relieving biologists from the overwhelming task of selecting among numerous models."
2509.23583,"Downsampling-based methods for time series forecasting have attracted increasing attention due to their superiority in capturing sequence trends. However, this approaches mainly capture dependencies within subsequences but neglect inter-subsequence and inter-channel interactions, which limits forecasting accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose CTPNet, a novel framework that explicitly learns representations from three perspectives: i) inter-channel dependencies, captured by a temporal query-based multi-head attention mechanism; ii) intra-subsequence dependencies, modeled via a Transformer to characterize trend variations; and iii) inter-subsequence dependencies, extracted by reusing the encoder with residual connections to capture global periodic patterns. By jointly integrating these levels, proposed method provides a more holistic representation of temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method."
2509.23713,"We present Text2MBL, a text-to-code generation framework that generates executable Building Information Modeling (BIM) code directly from textual descriptions of modular building layout (MBL) design. Unlike conventional layout generation approaches that operate in 2D space, Text2MBL produces fully parametric, semantically rich BIM layouts through on-the-fly code instantiation. To address MBLs' unique challenges due to their hierarchical three-tier structure: modules (physical building blocks), units (self-contained dwellings), and rooms (functional spaces), we developed an object-oriented code architecture and fine-tuned large language models to output structured action sequences in code format. To train and evaluate the framework, we curated a dataset of paired descriptions and ground truth layouts drawn from real-world modular housing projects. Performance was assessed using metrics for executable validity, semantic fidelity, and geometric consistency. By tightly unifying natural language understanding with BIM code generation, Text2MBL establishes a scalable pipeline from high-level conceptual design to automation-ready modular construction workflows. Our implementation is available atthis https URL."
2509.23862,"Tax risk supervision has become a critical component of modern financial governance, as irregular tax behaviors and hidden compliance risks pose significant challenges to regulatory authorities and enterprises alike. Traditional rule-based methods often struggle to capture complex and dynamic tax-related anomalies in large-scale enterprise data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework (DNN-Transformer-Autoencoder) for corporate tax risk supervision and risk level assessment. The framework integrates three complementary modules: a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for modeling static enterprise attributes, a Transformer-based architecture for capturing long-term dependencies in historical financial time series, and an Autoencoder (AE) for unsupervised detection of anomalous tax behaviors. The outputs of these modules are fused to generate a comprehensive risk score, which is further mapped into discrete risk levels (high, medium, low). Experimental evaluations on a real-world enterprise tax dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, achieving an accuracy of 0.91 and a Macro F1-score of 0.88. These results indicate that the hybrid model not only improves classification performance but also enhances interpretability and applicability in practical tax regulation scenarios. This study provides both methodological innovation and regulatory implications for intelligent tax risk management."
2509.2422,"As urban mobility integrates traditional and emerging modes, public transit systems are becoming increasingly complex. Some modes complement each other, while others compete, influencing users' multimodal itineraries. To provide a clear, high-level understanding of these interactions, we introduce the concept of a macroscopic multimodal hierarchy. In this framework, trips follow an ""ascending-descending"" order, starting and ending with lower hierarchical modes (e.g., walking) that offer high accessibility, while utilizing higher modes (e.g., subways) for greater efficiency. We propose a methodology to identify the multimodal hierarchy of a city using multimodal smart card itinerary data and demonstrate its application with actual data collected from Seoul and the surrounding metropolitan area in South Korea."
2509.2545,"This work develops a computational framework that combines physics-informed neural networks with multi-patch isogeometric analysis to solve partial differential equations on complex computer-aided design geometries. The method utilizes patch-local neural networks that operate on the reference domain of isogeometric analysis. A custom output layer enables the strong imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions. Solution conformity across interfaces between non-uniform rational B-spline patches is enforced using dedicated interface neural networks. Training is performed using the variational framework by minimizing the energy functional derived after the weak form of the partial differential equation. The effectiveness of the suggested method is demonstrated on two highly non-trivial and practically relevant use-cases, namely, a 2D magnetostatics model of a quadrupole magnet and a 3D nonlinear solid and contact mechanics model of a mechanical holder. The results show excellent agreement to reference solutions obtained with high-fidelity finite element solvers, thus highlighting the potential of the suggested neural solver to tackle complex engineering problems given the corresponding computer-aided design models."
2510.00543,"Large language models (LLMs) show great promise in healthcare, but their applications are hindered by data privacy restrictions and the challenges of cross-institution collaboration. Sensitive medical data cannot be centralized, while non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) characteristics across institutions further complicate convergence and fairness. To address these issues, we present a federated fine-tuning approach based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling privacy-preserving knowledge flow across institutions. The method iteratively combines local LoRA adaptation with global parameter aggregation, allowing efficient knowledge sharing without exposing raw data. A blockchain identity scheme is used for identifying individual LLM in such a distributed network. We evaluate this approach on heterogeneous and highly non-IID medical text datasets, where experiments demonstrate that federated LoRA not only enhances cross-client generalization but also improves the performance of the weakest client, achieving stable convergence and fairer outcomes. These findings highlight federated LoRA fine-tuning as a practical and effective paradigm for adapting LLMs in healthcare, offering a new path for multi-center medical AI collaboration."
2510.00589,"Signal classification models based on deep neural networks are typically trained on datasets collected under controlled conditions, either simulated or over-the-air (OTA), which are constrained to specific channel environments with limited variability, such as fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. As a result, these models often fail to generalize when deployed in real-world scenarios where the feature distribution significantly differs from the training domain. This paper explores unsupervised domain adaptation techniques to bridge the generalization gap between mismatched domains. Specifically, we investigate adaptation methods based on adversarial learning, statistical distance alignment, and stochastic modeling to align representations between simulated and OTA signal domains. To emulate OTA characteristics, we deliberately generate modulated signals subjected to realistic channel impairments without demodulation. We evaluate classification performance under three scenarios, i.e., cross-SNR, SNR-matched cross-domain, and stepwise adaptation involving both SNR and domain shifts. Experimental results show that unsupervised domain adaptation methods, particularly stochastic classifier (STAR) and joint adaptive networks (JAN), enable consistent and substantial performance gains over baseline models, which highlight their promise for real-world deployment in wireless systems."
2510.00669,"The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem has experienced over \$10 billion in direct losses due to crime events. Beyond these immediate losses, such events often trigger broader market reactions, including price declines, trading activity changes, and reductions in market capitalization. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) govern DeFi applications through tradable governance assets that function like corporate shares for voting and decision-making. Leveraging DeFi's granular trading data, we conduct an event study on 22 crime events between 2020 and 2022 to assess their economic impact on governance asset prices, trading volumes, and market capitalization. Using a dynamic difference-in-differences (DiD) framework with counterfactual governance assets, we aim for causal inference of intraday temporal effects. Our results show that 55% of crime events lead to significant negative price impacts, with an average decline of about 14%. Additionally, 68% of crime events lead to increased governance asset trading volume. Based on these impacts, we estimate indirect economic losses of over $1.3 billion in DAO market capitalization, far exceeding direct victim costs and accounting for 74% of total losses. Our study provides valuable insights into how crime events shape market dynamics and affect DAOs. Moreover, our methodological approach is reproducible and applicable beyond DAOs, offering a framework to assess the indirect economic impact on other cryptoassets."
2510.00884,"Constitutive evaluations often dominate the computational cost of finite element (FE) simulations whenever material models are complex. Neural constitutive models (NCMs) offer a highly expressive and flexible framework for modeling complex material behavior in solid mechanics. However, their practical adoption in large-scale FE simulations remains limited due to significant computational costs, especially in repeatedly evaluating stress and stiffness. NCMs thus represent an extreme case: their large computational graphs make stress and stiffness evaluations prohibitively expensive, restricting their use to small-scale problems. In this work, we introduce COMMET, an open-source FE framework whose architecture has been redesigned from the ground up to accelerate high-cost constitutive updates. Our framework features a novel assembly algorithm that supports batched and vectorized constitutive evaluations, compute-graph-optimized derivatives that replace automatic differentiation, and distributed-memory parallelism via MPI. These advances dramatically reduce runtime, with speed-ups exceeding three orders of magnitude relative to traditional non-vectorized automatic differentiation-based implementations. While we demonstrate these gains primarily for NCMs, the same principles apply broadly wherever for-loop based assembly or constitutive updates limit performance, establishing a new standard for large-scale, high-fidelity simulations in computational mechanics."
2510.00953,"This work introduces a new framework for modeling financial markets through an interpretable probabilistic state machine. By clustering historical returns based on momentum and risk features across multiple time horizons, we identify distinct market states that capture underlying regimes, such as expansion phase, contraction, crisis, or recovery. From a transition matrix representing the dynamics between these states, we construct a probabilistic state machine that models the temporal evolution of the market. This state machine enables the generation of a custom distribution of returns based on a mixture of Gaussian components weighted by state frequencies. We show that the proposed benchmark significantly outperforms the traditional approach in capturing key statistical properties of asset returns, including skewness and kurtosis, and our experiments across random assets and time periods confirm its robustness."
2510.01225,"The exponential growth of information presents a significant challenge for researchers and professionals seeking to remain at the forefront of their fields and this paper introduces an innovative framework for automatically generating insightful financial digests using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Google's Gemini Pro. By leveraging a combination of data extraction from OpenAlex, strategic prompt engineering, and LLM-driven analysis, we demonstrate the automated example of creating a comprehensive digests that generalize key findings, identify emerging trends. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional analysis methods, enabling the efficient processing of vast amounts of unstructured data and the delivery of actionable insights in an easily digestible format.

2510.01558,"Chagas disease affects nearly 6 million people worldwide, with Chagas cardiomyopathy representing its most severe complication. In regions where serological testing capacity is limited, AI-enhanced electrocardiogram (ECG) screening provides a critical diagnostic alternative. However, existing machine learning approaches face challenges such as limited accuracy, reliance on large labeled datasets, and more importantly, weak integration with evidence-based clinical diagnostic indicators. We propose a retrieval-augmented generation framework, CardioRAG, integrating large language models with interpretable ECG-based clinical features, including right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, and heart rate variability metrics. The framework uses variational autoencoder-learned representations for semantic case retrieval, providing contextual cases to guide clinical reasoning. Evaluation demonstrated high recall performance of 89.80%, with a maximum F1 score of 0.68 for effective identification of positive cases requiring prioritized serological testing. CardioRAG provides an interpretable, clinical evidence-based approach particularly valuable for resource-limited settings, demonstrating a pathway for embedding clinical indicators into trustworthy medical AI systems."
2510.02009,"This work introduces ShapeGen3DCP, a deep learning framework for fast and accurate prediction of filament cross-sectional geometry in 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP). The method is based on a neural network architecture that takes as input both material properties in the fluid state (density, yield stress, plastic viscosity) and process parameters (nozzle diameter, nozzle height, printing and flow velocities) to directly predict extruded layer shapes. To enhance generalization, some inputs are reformulated into dimensionless parameters that capture underlying physical principles. Predicted geometries are compactly represented using Fourier descriptors, which enforce smooth, closed, and symmetric profiles while reducing the prediction task to a small set of coefficients. The training dataset was synthetically generated using a well-established Particle Finite Element (PFEM) model of 3DCP, overcoming the scarcity of experimental data. Validation against diverse numerical and experimental cases shows strong agreement, confirming the framework's accuracy and reliability. This opens the way to practical uses ranging from pre-calibration of print settings, minimizing or even eliminating trial-and-error adjustments, to toolpath optimization for more advanced designs. Looking ahead, coupling the framework with simulations and sensor feedback could enable closed-loop digital twins for 3DCP, driving real-time process optimization, defect detection, and adaptive control of printing parameters."
2510.02013,"Structural Health Monitoring of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs) is critical for ensuring operational safety and efficiency. However, identifying damage in components like mooring systems from limited sensor data poses a challenging inverse problem, often characterized by multimodal solutions where various damage states could explain the observed response. To overcome it, we propose a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, where the encoder approximates the inverse operator, while the decoder approximates the forward. The posterior distribution of the latent space variables is probabilistically modeled, describing the uncertainties in the estimates. This work tackles the limitations of conventional Gaussian Mixtures used within VAEs, which can be either too restrictive or computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional spaces. We propose a novel Copula-based VAE architecture that decouples the marginal distribution of the variables from their dependence structure, offering a flexible method for representing complex, correlated posterior distributions. We provide a comprehensive comparison of three different approaches for approximating the posterior: a Gaussian Mixture with a diagonal covariance matrix, a Gaussian Mixture with a full covariance matrix, and a Gaussian Copula. Our analysis, conducted on a high-fidelity synthetic dataset, demonstrates that the Copula VAE offers a promising and tractable solution in high-dimensional spaces. Although the present work remains in the two-dimensional space, the results suggest efficient scalability to higher dimensions. It achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters than the Gaussian Mixture alternatives, whose parametrization grows prohibitively with the dimensionality. The results underscore the potential of Copula-based VAEs as a tool for uncertainty-aware damage identification in FOWT mooring systems."
2510.02472,"Surrogate models are essential in structural analysis and optimization. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts for geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse loading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The structure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and the plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node types: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart, demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance. The results show strong predictive accuracy for both displacement and von Mises stress, effectively capturing structural behavior patterns and maximum values."
2510.02702,"Understanding how urban residents travel between neighborhoods and destinations is critical for transportation planning, mobility management, and public health. By mining historical origin-to-destination flow patterns with spatial, temporal, and functional relations among urban places, we estimate probabilities of visits from neighborhoods to specific destinations. These probabilities capture neighborhood-level contributions to citywide vehicular and foot traffic, supporting demand estimation, accessibility assessment, and multimodal planning. Particularly, we introduce VisitHGNN, a heterogeneous, relation-specific graph neural network designed to predict visit probabilities at individual Points of interest (POIs). POIs are characterized using numerical, JSON-derived, and textual attributes, augmented with fixed summaries of POI--POI spatial proximity, temporal co-activity, and brand affinity, while census block groups (CBGs) are described with 72 socio-demographic variables. CBGs are connected via spatial adjacency, and POIs and CBGs are linked through distance-annotated cross-type edges. Inference is constrained to a distance-based candidate set of plausible origin CBGs, and training minimizes a masked Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to yield probability distribution across the candidate set. Using weekly mobility data from Fulton County, Georgia, USA, VisitHGNN achieves strong predictive performance with mean KL divergence of 0.287, MAE of 0.008, Top-1 accuracy of 0.853, and R-square of 0.892, substantially outperforming pairwise MLP and distance-only baselines, and aligning closely with empirical visitation patterns (NDCG@50 = 0.966); Recall@5 = 0.611). The resulting distributions closely mirror observed travel behavior with high fidelity, highlighting the model's potential for decision support in urban planning, transportation policy, mobility system design, and public health."
2510.03195,"Moving targets -- managers' strategic shifting of key performance metrics when the original targets become difficult to achieve -- have been shown to predict subsequent stock underperformance. However, our work reveals that the method employed in that study exhibits two key limitations that hinder the accuracy -- noise in the extracted targets and loss of contextual information -- both of which stem primarily from the use of a named entity recognition (NER). To address these two limitations, we propose an LLM-based target extraction method with a newly defined metric that better captures semantic context. This approach preserves semantic context beyond simple entity recognition and yields consistently higher predictive power than the original approach. Overall, our approach enhances the granularity and accuracy of financial text-based performance prediction."

2510.03788,"Following the success of Transformer architectures in language modeling, particularly their ability to capture long-range dependencies, researchers have explored how these architectures can be adapted for time-series forecasting. Transformer-based models have been proposed to handle both short- and long-term dependencies when predicting future values from historical data. However, studies such as those by Zeng et al. (2022) and Rizvi et al. (2025) have reported mixed results in long-term forecasting tasks. In this work, we evaluate the Gaussian-based Linear architecture introduced by Rizvi et al. (2025) and present an enhanced version called the Residual Stacked Gaussian Linear (RSGL) model. We also investigate the broader applicability of the RSGL model in additional domains, including financial time series and epidemiological data. Experimental results show that the RSGL model achieves improved prediction accuracy and robustness compared to both the baseline Gaussian Linear and Transformer-based models."
2510.04094,"A major problem of kernel-based methods (e.g., least squares support vector machines, LS-SVMs) for solving linear/nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is the prohibitive $O(an^3)$ ($a=1$ for linear ODEs and 27 for nonlinear ODEs) part of their computational complexity with increasing temporal discretization points $n$. We propose a novel Nyström-accelerated LS-SVMs framework that breaks this bottleneck by reformulating ODEs as primal-space constraints. Specifically, we derive for the first time an explicit Nyström-based mapping and its derivatives from one-dimensional temporal discretization points to a higher $m$-dimensional feature space ($1< m\le n$), enabling the learning process to solve linear/nonlinear equation systems with $m$-dependent complexity. Numerical experiments on sixteen benchmark ODEs demonstrate: 1) $10-6000$ times faster computation than classical LS-SVMs and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), 2) comparable accuracy to LS-SVMs ($<0.13\%$ relative MAE, RMSE, and $\left \| y-\hat{y} \right \| _{\infty } $difference) while maximum surpassing PINNs by 72\% in RMSE, and 3) scalability to $n=10^4$ time steps with $m=50$ features. This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient kernel-based ODEs learning without significantly sacrificing the accuracy of the solution."
2510.04187,"We propose a complement to constitutive modeling that augments neural networks with material principles to capture anisotropy and inelasticity at finite strains. The key element is a dual potential that governs dissipation, consistently incorporates anisotropy, and-unlike conventional convex formulations-satisfies the dissipation inequality without requiring convexity.Our neural network architecture employs invariant-based input representations in terms of mixed elastic, inelastic and structural tensors. It adapts Input Convex Neural Networks, and introduces Input Monotonic Neural Networks to broaden the admissible potential class. To bypass exponential-map time integration in the finite strain regime and stabilize the training of inelastic materials, we employ recurrent Liquid Neural Networks.The approach is evaluated at both material point and structural scales. We benchmark against recurrent models without physical constraints and validate predictions of deformation and reaction forces for unseen boundary value problems. In all cases, the method delivers accurate and stable performance beyond the training regime. The neural network and finite element implementations are available as open-source and are accessible to the public viathis https URL."
2510.04262,"In this study, the open-source finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solvers gprMax, Elecode and MEEP are investigated for their suitability to compute lightning electromagnetic field propagation. Several simulations are performed to reproduce the results of typical field propagation scenarios that can be found in the literature. The results of the presented solvers are validated through comparison with reference field results corresponding to propagation over perfectly conducting and lossy ground. In most of the tested scenarios, all solvers reproduce the reference fields with satisfactory accuracy. However, close attention must be paid to the proper choice of the spatial discretization to avoid artificial numerical dispersion, and the application of the simulation cell boundaries, which can cause significant impairment of the results due to undesired reflections. Some cases of inaccurate FDTD results due to improper choices of parameters are demonstrated. Further, the features, the performance and limitations, and the advantages and drawbacks of the presented solvers are highlighted. For familiarization with the solvers' programmatical interfaces to initialize and run the simulations, the developed scripts are made available to the community in an openly accessible repository."
2510.04322,"Partial differential equation (PDE) solvers underpin modern quantitative finance, governing option pricing and risk evaluation. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving the forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep learning. However they remain computationally expensive due to their iterative gradient descent based optimization and scale poorly with increasing model size. This paper introduces Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs) as fast alternative to PINNs for solving both forward and inverse problems in financial PDEs. PIELMs replace iterative optimization with a single least-squares solve, enabling deterministic and efficient training. We benchmark PIELM on the Black-Scholes and Heston-Hull-White models for forward pricing and demonstrate its capability in inverse model calibration to recover volatility and interest rate parameters from noisy data. From experiments we observe that PIELM achieve accuracy comparable to PINNs while being up to $30\times$ faster, highlighting their potential for real-time financial modeling."
2510.0449,"Partial differential equation (PDE) solvers are fundamental to engineering simulation. Classical mesh-based approaches (finite difference/volume/element) are fast and accurate on high-quality meshes but struggle with higher-order operators and complex, hard-to-mesh geometries. Recently developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their variants are mesh-free and flexible, yet compute-intensive and often less accurate. This paper systematically benchmarks RBF-PIELM, a rapid PINN variant-an extreme learning machine with radial-basis activations-for higher-order PDEs. RBF-PIELM replaces PINNs' time-consuming gradient descent with a single-shot least-squares solve. We test RBF-PIELM on the fourth-order biharmonic equation using two benchmarks: lid-driven cavity flow (streamfunction formulation) and a manufactured oscillatory solution. Our results show up to $(350\times)$ faster training than PINNs and over $(10\times)$ fewer parameters for comparable solution accuracy. Despite surpassing PINNs, RBF-PIELM still lags mature mesh-based solvers and its accuracy degrades on highly oscillatory solutions, highlighting remaining challenges for practical deployment."
2510.05572,"We introduce the Gaussian Ensemble Topology (GET) method, a new explicit and manufacture-ready framework for topology optimization in which design geometries are represented as superpositions of anisotropic Gaussian functions. By combining explicit Gaussian descriptions with a level-set-like Heaviside projection, GET inherently generates smooth, curvature-continuous designs without requiring post-processing steps such as mesh or corner smoothing and feature extraction. The method is validated on standard compliance-minimization and compliant mechanism benchmarks in two and three dimensions. The optimized designs achieve objective values comparable to those obtained with classical Moving Morphable Component (MMC) approaches, but with geometrically consistent, refined boundaries. Numerical examples demonstrate additional advantages of the GET framework, including mesh independence inherent to explicit parameterizations, strong geometric expressiveness, and effective control over smoothness, discreteness, and structural complexity through parameter tuning. As a robust and manufacture-ready approach to explicit topology optimization, GET opens avenues for tackling advanced and complex design problems."
2510.05747,"Physicochemically informed biological sequence generation has the potential to accelerate computer-aided cellular therapy, yet current models fail to \emph{jointly} ensure novelty, diversity, and biophysical plausibility when designing variable regions of T-cell receptors (TCRs). We present \textbf{PhysicoGPTCR}, a large generative protein Transformer that is \emph{dual-conditioned} on peptide and HLA context and trained to autoregressively synthesise TCR sequences while embedding residue-level physicochemical descriptors. The model is optimised on curated TCR--peptide--HLA triples with a maximum-likelihood objective and compared against ANN, GPTCR, LSTM, and VAE baselines. Across multiple neoantigen benchmarks, PhysicoGPTCR substantially improves edit-distance, similarity, and longest-common-subsequence scores, while populating a broader region of sequence space. Blind in-silico docking and structural modelling further reveal a higher proportion of binding-competent clones than the strongest baseline, validating the benefit of explicit context conditioning and physicochemical awareness. Experimental results demonstrate that dual-conditioned, physics-grounded generative modelling enables end-to-end design of functional TCR candidates, reducing the discovery timeline from months to minutes without sacrificing wet-lab verifiability."
2510.05835,"This study addresses the challenge of detecting code smells in large-scale software systems using machine learning (ML). Traditional detection methods often suffer from low accuracy and poor generalization across different datasets. To overcome these issues, we propose a machine learning-based model that automatically and accurately identifies code smells, offering a scalable solution for software quality analysis. The novelty of our approach lies in the use of eight diverse ML algorithms, including XGBoost, AdaBoost, and other classifiers, alongside key techniques such as the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for class imbalance and Pearson correlation for efficient feature selection. These methods collectively improve model accuracy and generalization. Our methodology involves several steps: first, we preprocess the data and apply SMOTE to balance the dataset; next, Pearson correlation is used for feature selection to reduce redundancy; followed by training eight ML algorithms and tuning hyperparameters through Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization. Finally, we evaluate the models using accuracy, F-measure, and confusion matrices. The results show that AdaBoost, Random Forest, and XGBoost perform best, achieving accuracies of 100%, 99%, and 99%, respectively. This study provides a robust framework for detecting code smells, enhancing software quality assurance, and demonstrating the effectiveness of a comprehensive, optimized ML approach."
2510.05995,"Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning nonlinear mappings between function spaces, enabling real-time prediction of complex dynamics in diverse scientific and engineering applications. With their growing adoption in engineering design evaluation, a wide range of neural operator architectures have been proposed for various problem settings. However, model selection remains challenging due to the absence of fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address this, we propose and standardize six representative 3D industry-scale engineering design datasets spanning thermal analysis, linear elasticity, elasto-plasticity, time-dependent plastic problems, and computational fluid dynamics. All datasets include fully preprocessed inputs and outputs for model training, making them directly usable across diverse neural operator architectures. Using these datasets, we conduct a systematic comparison of four types of neural operator variants, including Branch-Trunk-based Neural Operators inspired by DeepONet, Graph-based Neural Operators inspired by Graph Neural Networks, Grid-based Neural Operators inspired by Fourier Neural Operators, and Point-based Neural Operators inspired by PointNet. We further introduce practical enhancements to adapt these models to different engineering settings, improving the fairness of the comparison. Our benchmarking study evaluates each model strengths and limitations in terms of predictive performance, computational efficiency, memory usage, and deployment complexity. The findings provide actionable insights to guide future neural operator development."
2510.06466,"We develop a deep reinforcement learning framework for dynamic portfolio optimization that combines a Dirichlet policy with cross-sectional attention mechanisms. The Dirichlet formulation ensures that portfolio weights are always feasible, handles tradability constraints naturally, and provides a stable way to explore the allocation space. The model integrates per-asset temporal encoders with a global attention layer, allowing it to capture sector relationships, factor spillovers, and other cross asset dependencies. The reward function includes transaction costs and portfolio variance penalties, linking the learning objective to traditional mean variance trade offs. The results show that attention based Dirichlet policies outperform equal-weight and standard reinforcement learning benchmarks in terms of terminal wealth and Sharpe ratio, while maintaining realistic turnover and drawdown levels. Overall, the study shows that combining principled action design with attention-based representations improves both the stability and interpretability of reinforcement learning for portfolio management."
2510.06804,"An isogeometric boundary element method (BEM) is presented to solve scattering problems in an isotropic homogeneous medium. We consider wave problems governed by the scalar wave equation as in acoustics and the Lamé-Navier equations for elastodynamics considering the theory of linear elasticity. The underlying boundary integral equations imply time-dependent convolution integrals and allow us to determine the sought quantities in the bounded interior or the unbounded exterior after solving for the unknown Cauchy data. In the present work, the time-dependent convolution integrals are approximated by multi-stage Runge-Kutta (RK) based convolution quadratures that involve steady-state solutions in the Laplace domain. The proposed method discretizes the spatial variables in the framework of isogeometric analysis (IGA), entailing a patchwise smooth spline basis. Overall, it enables high convergence rates in space and time. The implementation scheme follows an element structure defined by the non-empty knot spans in the knot vectors and local, uniform Bernstein polynomials as basis functions. The algorithms to localize the basis functions on the elements are outlined and explained. The solutions of the mixed problems are approximated by the BEM based on a symmetric Galerkin variational formulation and a collocation method. We investigate convergence rates of the approximative solutions in a mixed space and time error norm."
2510.06864,"In modern financial markets, news plays a critical role in shaping investor sentiment and influencing stock price movements. However, most existing studies aggregate daily news sentiment into a single score, potentially overlooking important variations in topic content and relevance. This simplification may mask nuanced relationships between specific news themes and market responses. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework to examine how different news topics influence stock price movements. The framework encodes individual news headlines into dense semantic embeddings using a pretrained sentence transformer, then applies K-means clustering to identify distinct news topics. Topic exposures are incorporated as explanatory variables in an ordinary least squares regression to quantify their impact on daily stock returns. Applied to Apple Inc., the framework reveals that certain topics are significantly associated with positive or negative next-day returns, while others have no measurable effect. These findings highlight the importance of topic-level analysis in understanding the relationship between news content and financial markets. The proposed framework provides a scalable approach for both researchers and practitioners to assess the informational value of different news topics and suggests a promising direction for improving predictive models of stock price movement."
2510.07057,"Latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) systems are compelling candidates for energy storage, primarily owing to their high storage density. Improving their performance is crucial for developing the next-generation efficient and cost effective devices. Topology optimization (TO) has emerged as a powerful computational tool to design LHTES systems by optimally distributing a high-conductivity material (HCM) and a phase change material (PCM). However, conventional TO typically limits to optimizing the geometry for a fixed, pre-selected materials. This approach does not leverage the large and expanding databases of novel materials. Consequently, the co-design of material and geometry for LHTES remains a challenge and unexplored.To address this limitation, we present an automated design framework for the concurrent optimization of material choice and topology. A key challenge is the discrete nature of material selection, which is incompatible with the gradient-based methods used for TO. We overcome this by using a data-driven variational autoencoder (VAE) to project discrete material databases for both the HCM and PCM onto continuous and differentiable latent spaces. These continuous material representations are integrated into an end-to-end differentiable, transient nonlinear finite-element solver that accounts for phase change. We demonstrate this framework on a problem aimed at maximizing the discharged energy within a specified time, subject to cost constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through several illustrative examples."
2510.07661,"The increasing influence of unstructured external information, such as news articles, on stock prices has attracted growing attention in financial markets. Despite recent advances, most existing newsbased forecasting models represent all articles using sentiment scores or average embeddings that capture the general tone but fail to provide quantitative, context-aware explanations of the impacts of public sentiment on predictions. To address this limitation, we propose an interpretable keyword-guided network (IKNet), which is an explainable forecasting framework that models the semantic association between individual news keywords and stock price movements. The IKNet identifies salient keywords via FinBERTbased contextual analysis, processes each embedding through a separate nonlinear projection layer, and integrates their representations with the time-series data of technical indicators to forecast next-day closing prices. By applying Shapley Additive Explanations the model generates quantifiable and interpretable attributions for the contribution of each keyword to predictions. Empirical evaluations of S&P 500 data from 2015 to 2024 demonstrate that IKNet outperforms baselines, including recurrent neural networks and transformer models, reducing RMSE by up to 32.9% and improving cumulative returns by 18.5%. Moreover, IKNet enhances transparency by offering contextualized explanations of volatility events driven by public sentiment."
2510.07957,"Forecasting state evolution of network systems, such as the spread of information on social networks, is significant for effective policy interventions and resource management. However, the underlying propagation dynamics constantly shift with new topics or events, which are modeled as changing coefficients of the underlying dynamics. Deep learning models struggle to adapt to these out-of-distribution shifts without extensive new data and retraining. To address this, we present Zero-Shot Forecasting of Network Dynamics through Weight Flow Matching (FNFM), a generative, coefficient-conditioned framework that generates dynamic model weights for an unseen target coefficient, enabling zero-shot forecasting. Our framework utilizes a Variational Encoder to summarize the forecaster weights trained in observed environments into compact latent tokens. A Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) module then learns a continuous transport from a simple Gaussian distribution to the empirical distribution of these weights, conditioned on the dynamical coefficients. This process is instantaneous at test time and requires no gradient-based optimization. Across varied dynamical coefficients, empirical results indicate that FNFM yields more reliable zero-shot accuracy than baseline methods, particularly under pronounced coefficient shift."
2510.08097,"This paper presents a general mathematical programming framework for the design and optimization of supply chain infrastructures for the upcycling of plastic waste. For this purpose, a multi-product, multi-echelon, multi-period mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model has been formulated. The objective is to minimize the cost of the entire circular supply chain starting from the collection of post-consumer plastic waste to the production of virgin-equivalent high value polymers, satisfying a large number of constraints from collection quota to the quality of the feedstock. The framework aims to support the strategic planning of future circular supply chains by determining the optimal number, locations and sizes of various types of facilities as well as the amounts of materials to be transported between the nodes of the supply chain network over a specified period. The functionality of the framework has been tested with a case study for the upcycling of rigid polyurethane foam waste coming from construction sites in Germany. The economic potential and infrastructure requirements are evaluated, and it has been found that from a solely economic perspective, the current status of the value chain is not competitive with fossil-based feedstock or incineration. However, with the right economic incentives, there is a considerable potential to establish such value chains, once the upcycling technology is ready and the economic framework conditions have stabilized."
2510.08126,"Arranging many modules within a bounded domain without overlap, central to the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) of very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits, represents a broad class of discrete geometric optimization problems with physical constraints. This paper develops a variational and spectral framework for Poisson energy-based floorplanning and placement in physical design. We show that the Poisson energy, defined via a Neumann Poisson equation, is exactly the squared H^{-1} Sobolev norm of the density residual, providing a functional-analytic interpretation of the classical electrostatic analogy. Through spectral analysis, we demonstrate that the energy acts as an intrinsic low-pass filter, suppressing high-frequency fluctuations while enforcing large-scale uniformity. Under a mild low-frequency dominance assumption, we establish a quantitative linear lower bound relating the Poisson energy to the geometric overlap area, thereby justifying its use as a smooth surrogate for the hard nonoverlap constraint. We further show that projected gradient descent converges globally to stationary points and exhibits local linear convergence near regular minima. Finally, we interpret the continuous-time dynamics as a Wasserstein-2 gradient flow, revealing the intrinsic nonlocality and global balancing behavior of the model. These results provide a mathematically principled foundation for PDE-regularized optimization in large-scale floorplanning and related geometric layout problems."
2510.08301,"Optimization problems in chemical process design involve a significant number of discrete and continuous decisions. When taking into account uncertainties, the search space is very difficult to explore, even for experienced engineers. Moreover, it should be taken into account that while some decisions are fixed at the design stage, other parameters can be adapted to the realization of the uncertainty during the operation of the plant. This leads to a two-stage optimization problem which is difficult to solve. To address this challenge, we propose to combine commercial process simulation software with an evolutionary strategy. This approach is applied to designing a downstream process to isolate valuable products from pyrolysis oil produced by the catalytic pyrolysis of rigid polyurethane foam. The suggested algorithm consistently performed better than a manually designed robust process. Additionally, the analysis of different scenarios provided insight into promising changes in the overall layout of the recycling process."
2510.089,"AI-assisted molecular property prediction has become a promising technique in early-stage drug discovery and materials design in recent years. However, due to high-cost and complex wet-lab experiments, real-world molecules usually experience the issue of scarce annotations, leading to limited labeled data for effective supervised AI model learning. In light of this, few-shot molecular property prediction (FSMPP) has emerged as an expressive paradigm that enables learning from only a few labeled examples. Despite rapidly growing attention, existing FSMPP studies remain fragmented, without a coherent framework to capture methodological advances and domain-specific challenges. In this work, we present the first comprehensive and systematic survey of few-shot molecular property prediction. We begin by analyzing the few-shot phenomenon in molecular datasets and highlighting two core challenges: (1) cross-property generalization under distribution shifts, where each task corresponding to each property, may follow a different data distribution or even be inherently weakly related to others from a biochemical perspective, requiring the model to transfer knowledge across heterogeneous prediction tasks, and (2) cross-molecule generalization under structural heterogeneity, where molecules involved in different or same properties may exhibit significant structural diversity, making model difficult to achieve generalization. Then, we introduce a unified taxonomy that organizes existing methods into data, model, and learning paradigm levels, reflecting their strategies for extracting knowledge from scarce supervision in few-shot molecular property prediction. Next, we compare representative methods, summarize benchmark datasets and evaluation protocols. In the end, we identify key trends and future directions for advancing the continued research on FSMPP."
2510.10037,"Generative AI for automated glaucoma diagnostic report generation faces two predominant challenges: content redundancy in narrative outputs and inadequate highlighting of pathologically significant features including optic disc cupping, retinal nerve fiber layer defects, and visual field abnormalities. These limitations primarily stem from current multimodal architectures' insufficient capacity to extract discriminative structural-textural patterns from fundus imaging data while maintaining precise semantic alignment with domain-specific terminology in comprehensive clinical reports. To overcome these constraints, we present the Dual-Attention Semantic Parallel-LSTM Network (DA-SPL), an advanced multimodal generation framework that synergistically processes both fundus imaging and supplementary visual inputs. DA-SPL employs an Encoder-Decoder structure augmented with the novel joint dual-attention mechanism in the encoder for cross-modal feature refinement, the parallelized LSTM decoder architecture for enhanced temporal-semantic consistency, and the specialized label enhancement module for accurate disease-relevant term generation. Rigorous evaluation on standard glaucoma datasets demonstrates DA-SPL's consistent superiority over state-of-the-art models across quantitative metrics. DA-SPL exhibits exceptional capability in extracting subtle pathological indicators from multimodal inputs while generating diagnostically precise reports that exhibit strong concordance with clinical expert annotations."
2510.10387,"Predicting stock returns remains a central challenge in quantitative finance, transitioning from traditional statistical methods to contemporary deep learning techniques. However, many current models struggle with effectively capturing spatio-temporal dynamics and integrating multiple relational data sources. This study proposes GrifFinNet, a Graph-Relation Integrated Transformer for Financial Predictions, which combines multi-relational graph modeling with Transformer-based temporal encoding. GrifFinNet constructs inter-stock relation graphs based on industry sectors and institutional ownership, and incorporates an adaptive gating mechanism to dynamically integrate relational data in response to changing market conditions. This approach enables the model to jointly capture spatial dependencies and temporal patterns, offering a comprehensive representation of market dynamics.

2510.10624,"This contribution presents a model order reduction strategy for fast parametric modelling of problems with cracks formulated on spline discretizations. In the context of damage detection, parametric reduced order models (ROMs) are well suited for fast computations by establishing an efficient offline/online split of the simulation process. The problems of interest focus on geometric parameters that describe the crack configuration and may pose challenges to constructing efficient ROMs. This work proposes a framework based on non-intrusive reduced basis methods and a localization strategy tailored to parametric problems with moving discontinuities. The combined benefits of non-intrusive ROMs and localization enable accurate and efficient reduction with low online cost. We demonstrate the applicability of the ROM approach with benchmark tests on linear elastic problems discretized with splines and the extended isogeometric method (XIGA) for crack modelling. The results we obtain show the accuracy and real-time efficiency of the constructed reduced order models."
2510.10763,"In-stent restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention is a multifactorial process. Specific morphological lesion characteristics were observed to contribute to the occurrence of in-stent restenosis. Local mechanical factors, such as stresses and strains, are known to influence tissue adaptation after stent implantation. However, the influence of morphological features on those local mechanical states and, hence, on the occurrence of in-stent restenosis remains understudied. This work investigates the correlation between local mechanical quantities and in-stent restenosis by evaluating the stress distributions in the artery wall during and after stent implantation for informative lesion morphologies. We perform computational simulations of the stenting procedure with physics-based patient-specific coronary artery models. Different morphologies are assessed using the spatial plaque composition information from high-resolution coronary computed tomography angiography data. We quantify the correlation between in-stent restenosis and local tensional stresses. We found that specific morphological characteristics like circumferential or asymmetric block calcifications result in higher stresses in the surrounding tissue. This study concludes that local stresses are critical for assessing the individual in-stent restenosis risk."
2510.10859,"This work presents an objective, repeatable, automatic, and fast methodology for assessing the representativeness of geophysical variables sampled by Earth-observing satellites. The primary goal is to identify and mitigate potential sampling biases attributed to orbit selection during pre-Phase A mission studies. This methodology supports current incubation activities for a future Planetary Boundary Layer observing system by incorporating a sampling effectiveness measure into a broader architectural study. The study evaluates the effectiveness of 20 satellite configurations for observing convective storm activity in the Southwestern U.S. during the North American Monsoon (NAM) season. The primary design variables are the number of satellites, orbit type (sun-synchronous or inclined), and Local Time of Ascending Node (LTAN). Using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to assess observational representativeness and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate probability density functions, the study quantifies the discrepancy between observed and ground truth storm features. Results indicate that a two-satellite sun-synchronous system with an 8:00 PM LTAN, achieved the lowest KL divergence, signifying the most representative observation of storm clusters. In contrast, single-satellite configurations, particularly those with late-night LTANs (e.g., 12:00 AM), demonstrated significantly higher KL divergence. The study concludes that dual-satellite configurations in sun-synchronous orbits with evening LTANs outperform single-satellite and inclined configurations in capturing representative convective storm activity.

2510.10954,"The capacity to predict human spatial preferences within built environments is instrumental for developing Cyber-Physical-Social Infrastructure Systems (CPSIS). A significant challenge in this domain is the generalizability of preference models, particularly their efficacy in predicting preferences within environmental configurations not encountered during training. While deep learning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual dependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most effective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and standard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a simplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this illustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models are evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by heterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability score is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the seen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for imbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network architecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built environments."
2510.11095,"Many real-world inverse problems suffer from limited data, often because they rely on measurements of a single physical field. Such data frequently fail to sufficiently reduce parameter uncertainty in Bayesian inverse analysis. Incorporating easily available data from additional physical fields can substantially decrease this uncertainty. We focus on Bayesian inverse analyses based on computational models, e.g., those using the finite element method. To incorporate data from additional physical fields, the computational model must be extended to include these fields. While this model extension may have little to no effect on forward model predictions, it can greatly enhance inverse analysis by leveraging the multi-physics data. Our work proposes this multi-physics-enhanced inverse approach and demonstrates its potential using two models: a simple model with one-way coupled fields and a complex computational model with fully coupled fields. We quantify the uncertainty reduction by comparing the effect of single-physics and multi-physics data on the information gain from the prior to the posterior. Our results show that even a few or noisy data points from an additional physical field can considerably increase the information gain, even if this field is weakly or one-way coupled. Although multi-physics data are often readily available, it is remarkable that their potential has been largely neglected in model calibration so far. Instead, costly and time-consuming additional experimental setups are often pursued. In contrast, incorporating multi-physics data requires minimal effort when multi-physics models are readily available or easy to implement, as is the case with uncoupled and one-way coupled models. This work proposes and promotes the future use of multi-physics-enhanced Bayesian inverse analysis as a cost- and time-saving game-changer across various fields of science and industry."
2510.1136,"Quick commerce (q-commerce) is one of the fastest growing sectors in India. It provides informal employment to approximately 4,50,000 workers, and it is estimated to become a USD 200 Billion industry by 2026. A significant portion of this industry deals with perishable goods. (e.g. milk, dosa batter etc.) These are food items which are consumed relatively fresh by the consumers and therefore their order volume is high and repetitive even when the average basket size is relatively small. The fundamental challenge for the retailer is that, increasing selling price would hamper sales and would lead to unsold inventory. On the other hand setting a price less, would lead to forgoing of potential revenue. This paper attempts to propose a mathematical model which formalizes this dilemma. The problem statement is not only important for improving the unit economics of the perennially loss making quick commerce firms, but also would lead to a trickle-down effect in improving the conditions of the gig workers as observed in [4]. The sections below describe the mathematical formulation. The results from the simulation would be published in a follow-up study."
2510.11636,"Solving large-scale Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on complex three-dimensional geometries represents a central challenge in scientific and engineering computing, often impeded by expensive pre-processing stages and substantial computational overhead. We introduce Low-Rank Query-based PDE Solver (LRQ-Solver), a physics-integrated framework engineered for rapid, accurate, and highly scalable simulations of industrial-grade models. This framework is built upon two primary technical innovations. First, our Parameter Conditioned Lagrangian Modeling (PCLM) approach explicitly couples local physical states with global design parameters, enabling robust predictions across varied simulation configurations. By embedding physical consistency directly into the learning architecture, PCLM ensures that predictions remain physically meaningful even under unseen design conditions, significantly enhancing generalization and reliability. Second, the Low-Rank Query Attention (LR-QA) module leverages the second-order statistics of physical fields to construct a global coherence kernel, reducing the computational complexity of attention from O(N2) to O(NC2 + C3). By replacing point-wise clustering with covariance decomposition, LRQ-Solver achieves exceptional scalability efficiently processing up to 2 million points on a single GPU. Validated on standard benchmarks, LRQ-Solver achieves a 38.9% error reduction on the DrivAerNet++ dataset and 28.76% on the 3D Beam dataset, alongside a training speedup of up to 50 times. Our results establish that LRQ-Solver offers a powerful paradigm for multi-configuration physics simulations, delivering a SOTA combination of accuracy, scalability, and efficiency.

2510.12139,"This paper introduces a novel disk array architecture, designated RAID-0e (Resilient Striping Array), designed to superimpose a low-overhead fault tolerance layer upon traditional RAID 0 (striping). By employing a logically and physically separate parity domain to protect a primary data domain, RAID-0e mitigates the risk of array-wide data loss from common, non-catastrophic media failures, such as isolated bad blocks, transient read errors, or sector-level corruption. The architecture is engineered to preserve the intrinsic read performance advantages of RAID 0 while significantly enhancing data availability and operational resilience. This document provides a comprehensive exposition of the architectural principles, operational workflows, performance characteristics, failure mode analysis, and security considerations of RAID-0e. It is presented as an experimental yet pragmatic solution for environments seeking a new equilibrium between I/O performance, storage cost, and data resilience, particularly where full drive failure is a secondary concern to media degradation."
2510.12189,"In real-world stock markets, certain chart patterns -- such as price declines near historical highs -- cannot be fully explained by fundamentals alone. These phenomena suggest the presence of path dependence in price formation, where investor decisions are influenced not only by current market conditions but also by the trajectory of prices leading up to the present. Path dependence has drawn attention in behavioral finance as a key mechanism behind such anomalies. One plausible driver of path dependence is human loss aversion, anchored to individual reference points like purchase prices or past peaks, which vary with personal context. However, capturing such subtle behavioral tendencies in traditional agent-based market simulations has remained a challenge. We propose the Fundamental-Chartist-LLM-Agent (FCLAgent), which uses large language models (LLMs) to emulate human-like trading decisions. In this framework, (1) buy/sell decisions are made by LLMs based on individual situations, while (2) order price and volume follow standard rule-based methods. Simulations show that FCLAgents reproduce path-dependent patterns that conventional agents fail to capture. Furthermore, an analysis of FCLAgents' behavior reveals that the reference points guiding loss aversion vary with market trajectories, highlighting the potential of LLM-based agents to model nuanced investor behavior."
2510.12368,"Shallow Recurrent Decoder networks are a novel data-driven methodology able to provide accurate state estimation in engineering systems, such as nuclear reactors. This deep learning architecture is a robust technique designed to map the temporal trajectories of a few sparse measures to the full state space, including unobservable fields, which is agnostic to sensor positions and able to handle noisy data through an ensemble strategy, leveraging the short training times and without the need for hyperparameter tuning. Following its application to a novel reactor concept, this work investigates the performance of Shallow Recurrent Decoders when applied to a real system. The underlying model is represented by a fluid dynamics model of the TRIGA Mark II research reactor; the architecture will use both synthetic temperature data coming from the numerical model and leveraging experimental temperature data recorded during a previous campaign. The objective of this work is, therefore, two-fold: 1) assessing if the architecture can reconstruct the full state of the system (temperature, velocity, pressure, turbulence quantities) given sparse data located in specific, low-dynamics channels and 2) assessing the correction capabilities of the architecture (that is, given a discrepancy between model and data, assessing if sparse measurements can provide some correction to the architecture output). As will be shown, the accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field, using both synthetic and experimental data, in real-time makes this approach suitable for interpretable monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin."
2510.13157,"Despite continuous advancements in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerical reasoning remains a challenging area. Techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, tree-of-thought prompting, and program-of-thought prompting guide LLMs through intermediate reasoning steps. Although in-context learning with few-shot prompting has improved performance, LLMs still lag behind state-of-the-art models on financial numerical reasoning datasets such as FinQA and ConvFinQA. In this work, we introduce FINDER, a novel two-step framework, to enhance LLMs' capabilities in financial numerical reasoning. The first step utilizes a generative retriever to extract relevant facts from unstructured data, including both text and tables. This is followed by context-aware Program of Thought prompting with dynamic selection of in-context examples. Our model FINDER achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on both the FinQA and ConvFinQA datasets, surpassing previous benchmarks with execution accuracy improvements of 5.98% and 4.05%, respectively."
2510.13559,"Recently, unsupervised constitutive model discovery has gained attention through frameworks based on the Virtual Fields Method (VFM), most prominently the EUCLID approach. However, the performance of VFM-based approaches, including EUCLID, is affected by measurement noise and data sparsity, which are unavoidable in practice. The statistical finite element method (statFEM) offers a complementary perspective by providing a Bayesian framework for assimilating noisy and sparse measurements to reconstruct the full-field displacement response, together with quantified uncertainty. While statFEM recovers displacement fields under uncertainty, it does not strictly enforce consistency with constitutive relations or aim to yield interpretable constitutive models. In this work, we couple statFEM with unsupervised constitutive model discovery in the EUCLID framework, yielding statFEM--EUCLID. The framework is demonstrated for isotropic hyperelastic materials. The results show that this integration reduces sensitivity to noise and data sparsity, while ensuring that the reconstructed fields remain consistent with both equilibrium and constitutive laws."
2510.13937,"Automated rock classification from mineral composition presents a significant challenge in geological applications, with critical implications for material recycling, resource management, and industrial processing. While existing methods using One dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) excel at mineral identification through Raman spectroscopy, the crucial step of determining rock types from mineral assemblages remains unsolved, particularly because the same minerals can form different rock types depending on their proportions and formation conditions. This study presents a novel knowledge-enhanced deep learning approach that integrates geological domain expertise with spectral analysis. The performance of five machine learning methods were evaluated out of which the 1D-CNN and its uncertainty-aware variant demonstrated excellent mineral classification performance (98.37+-0.006% and 97.75+-0.010% respectively). The integrated system's evaluation on rock samples revealed variable performance across lithologies, with optimal results for limestone classification but reduced accuracy for rocks sharing similar mineral assemblages. These findings not only show critical challenges in automated geological classification systems but also provide a methodological framework for advancing material characterization and sorting technologies."
2510.14264,"While Large Language Model (LLM) agents show promise in automated trading, they still face critical limitations. Prominent multi-agent frameworks often suffer from inefficiency, produce inconsistent signals, and lack the end-to-end optimization required to learn a coherent strategy from market feedback. To address this, we introduce AlphaQuanter, a single-agent framework that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to learn a dynamic policy over a transparent, tool-augmented decision workflow, which empowers a single agent to autonomously orchestrate tools and proactively acquire information on demand, establishing a transparent and auditable reasoning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlphaQuanter achieves state-of-the-art performance on key financial metrics. Moreover, its interpretable reasoning reveals sophisticated strategies, offering novel and valuable insights for human traders.

2510.14487,"Efficient modeling of High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) is crucial for real-time quench monitoring; however, full-order electromagnetic simulations remain prohibitively costly due to the strong nonlinearities. Conventional reduced-order methods, such as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM), alleviate this cost but are limited by intrusive implementation and by the need for many interpolation points. This work investigates reduced-order strategies for Integral Equation Method (IEM) of HTS systems. We present the first application of POD-DEIM to IEM-based HTS models, and introduce a Structured Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) approach that learns nonlinear dynamics directly in the reduced space. Benchmark results show that the Neural ODE outperforms POD-DEIM in both efficiency and accuracy, highlighting its potential for real-time superconducting simulations."
2510.15113,"Slow-moving vehicles relying on crustal magnetic anomaly navigation (MagNav) or vehicles revisiting the same location in a short time - such as those used for surveys in magnetic anomaly mapping - require fixed ground stations within 100 km of the vehicle's trajectory to measure and remove the geomagnetic disturbance field from magnetic readings. This approach is impractical due to the limited network of fixed-ground magnetometer stations, making long-range (several hundred kilometers long) aeromagnetic surveys for anomaly map-making infeasible. To address these challenges, we developed the Extended Reference Station Model (ERSM). ERSM applies a longitudinal correction and regression model to an extended reference ground magnetometer station (ERS) to produce an estimate of the local temporal disturbance field. ERSM is regression model-agnostic, so we implemented a linear regression, a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) regression, and a neural-network regression model to assess performance benefits. Our results show typical performance below 10nT root mean square error and median performance below 5nT for typical use with the kNN and neural-net model for farther distances and below 5nT performance using the linear regression model on stations with proximity. We also consider how space-weather events, water-body separation, and proximity to polar regions affect the model performance based on ERS selection."
2510.15205,"Prediction markets, such as Polymarket, aggregate dispersed information into tradable probabilities, but they still lack a unifying stochastic kernel comparable to the one options gained from Black-Scholes. As these markets scale with institutional participation, exchange integrations, and higher volumes around elections and macro prints, market makers face belief volatility, jump, and cross-event risks without standardized tools for quoting or hedging. We propose such a foundation: a logit jump-diffusion with risk-neutral drift that treats the traded probability p_t as a Q-martingale and exposes belief volatility, jump intensity, and dependence as quotable risk factors. On top, we build a calibration pipeline that filters microstructure noise, separates diffusion from jumps using expectation-maximization, enforces the risk-neutral drift, and yields a stable belief-volatility surface. We then define a coherent derivative layer (variance, correlation, corridor, and first-passage instruments) analogous to volatility and correlation products in option markets. In controlled experiments on synthetic risk-neutral paths and real event data, the model reduces short-horizon belief-variance forecast error relative to diffusion-only and probability-space baselines, supporting both causal calibration and economic interpretability. Conceptually, the logit jump-diffusion kernel supplies an implied-volatility analogue for prediction markets: a tractable, tradable language for quoting, hedging, and transferring belief risk across venues such as Polymarket."
2510.15612,"Decentralized prediction markets (DePMs) allow open participation in event-based wagering without fully relying on centralized intermediaries. We review the history of DePMs which date back to 2011 and includes hundreds of proposals. Perhaps surprising, modern DePMs like Polymarket deviate materially from earlier designs like Truthcoin and Augur v1. We use our review to present a modular workflow comprising seven stages: underlying infrastructure, market topic, share structure and pricing, trading, market resolution, settlement, and archiving. For each module, we enumerate the design variants, analyzing trade-offs around decentralization, expressiveness, and manipulation resistance. We also identify open problems for researchers interested in this ecosystem."
2510.16386,"When performing evolutionary optimization for computationally expensive objective, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm(SAEA) is an effective approach. However, due to the limited availability of data in these scenarios, it can be challenging to create a highly accurate surrogate model, leading to reduced optimization effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose an Interpretable Convolution Network(ICN) for offline surrogate-assited evolutionary optimization. ICN retains the non-linear expression ability of traditional neural networks, while possessing the advantages of clear physical structure and the ability to incorporate prior knowledge during network parameter design and training process. We compare ICN-SAEA with tri-training method(TT-DDEA) and model-ensemble method(DDEA-SA) in several benchmark problems. Experimental results show that ICN-SAEA is better in searching optimal solution than compared algorithms."
2510.16575,"Multi-scale simulations of nonlinear heterogeneous materials and composites are challenging due to the prohibitive computational costs of high-fidelity simulations. Recently, machine learning (ML) based approaches have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional multiscale methods. However, existing ML surrogate constitutive models struggle in capturing long-range dependencies and generalization across microstructures. The recent advancements in attention-based Transformer architectures open the door to a more powerful class of surrogate models. Attention mechanism has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and computer vision. In this work, we introduce a surrogate (meta) model, namely ViT-Transformer, using a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and a Transformer-based decoder which are both driven by the self-attention mechanism. The ViT encoder extracts microstructural features from material images, while the decoder is a masked Transformer encoder that combines the latent geometrical features with the macroscopic strain input sequence to predict the corresponding stress response. To enhance training, we propose a random extract training algorithm that improves robustness to sequences of variable length. We design and construct a compact yet diverse dataset via data augmentation, and validate the surrogate model using various composite material images and loading scenarios. Several numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness and accuracy of the ViT-Transformer model and the training algorithm."
2510.1688,"Although large language models (LLMs) have significant potential to advance chemical discovery, current LLMs lack core chemical knowledge, produce unreliable reasoning trajectories, and exhibit suboptimal performance across diverse chemical tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Chem-R, a generalizable Chemical Reasoning model designed to emulate the deliberative processes of chemists. Chem-R is trained through a three-phase framework that progressively builds advanced reasoning capabilities, including: 1) Chemical Foundation Training, which establishes core chemical knowledge. 2) Chemical Reasoning Protocol Distillation, incorporating structured, expert-like reasoning traces to guide systematic and reliable problem solving. 3) Multi-task Group Relative Policy Optimization that optimizes the model for balanced performance across diverse molecular- and reaction-level tasks. This structured pipeline enables Chem-R to achieve state-of-the-art performance on comprehensive benchmarks, surpassing leading large language models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1, by up to 32% on molecular tasks and 48% on reaction tasks. Meanwhile, Chem-R also consistently outperforms the existing chemical foundation models across both molecular and reaction level tasks. These results highlight Chem-R's robust generalization, interpretability, and potential as a foundation for next-generation AI-driven chemical discovery.

2510.16889,"Structural Health Monitoring plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety, reliability, and longevity of bridge infrastructures through early damage detection. Although recent advances in deep learning-based models have enabled automated event detection, their performance is often limited by data scarcity, environmental noise, and class imbalance. To address these challenges, this study introduces a customized Generative Adversarial Network model, STFTSynth, designed particularly for generating short-time Fourier transform spectrograms derived from acoustic event signals. In contrast to augmentation techniques such as MixUp, generative adversarial networks can synthesize high-quality spectrograms that mimic real-world events, enhancing dataset diversity and robustness. The proposed model integrates dense residual blocks for spatial consistency with bidirectional gated recurrent units for temporal dependency modeling. Model performance is evaluated against three baseline generative models using qualitative inspection and quantitative metrics, including Structural Similarity Index Measure, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, and Fréchet Inception Distance. Results show that STFTSynth outperforms baseline models, producing high-resolution, temporally consistent spectrograms that align closely with real-world data. These findings indicate the potential of generative-based data augmentation as a scalable and cost-effective solution for bridge monitoring scenarios where rare events, such as prestressing wire breakage, suffer from data scarcity."
2510.17165,"Foundation models - already transformative in domains such as natural language processing - are now starting to emerge for time-series tasks in finance. While these pretrained architectures promise versatile predictive signals, little is known about how they shape the risk profiles of the trading strategies built atop them, leaving practitioners reluctant to commit serious capital. In this paper, we propose an extension to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) that disentangles the systematic risk introduced by a shared foundation model - potentially capable of generating alpha if the underlying model is genuinely predictive - from the idiosyncratic risk attributable to custom fine-tuning, which typically accrues no systematic premium. To enable a practical estimation of these separate risks, we align this decomposition with the concepts of uncertainty disentanglement, casting systematic risk as epistemic uncertainty (rooted in the pretrained model) and idiosyncratic risk as aleatory uncertainty (introduced during custom adaptations). Under the Aleatory Collapse Assumption, we illustrate how Monte Carlo dropout - among other methods in the uncertainty-quantization toolkit - can directly measure the epistemic risk, thereby mapping trading strategies to a more transparent risk-return plane. Our experiments show that isolating these distinct risk factors yields deeper insights into the performance limits of foundation-model-based strategies, their model degradation over time, and potential avenues for targeted refinements. Taken together, our results highlight both the promise and the pitfalls of deploying large pretrained models in competitive financial markets."
2510.17279,"Non-destructive methods are essential for linking the microstructural geometry of porous materials to their mechanical behavior, as destructive testing is often infeasible due to limited material availability or irreproducible conditions. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) provides high resolution three dimensional reconstructions of porous microstructures, enabling direct quantification of geometric descriptors. Recent advances in morphometric theory have demonstrated that four independent morphometric measures (porosity, surface area, mean curvature, and Euler characteristic) are required to capture the relationship between microstructure and strength, thereby forming the basis of generalized strength laws. To facilitate practical application of this framework, a Fiji plugin was developed to extract the four morphometric measures (porosity, surface area, mean curvature, Euler characteristic) from micro-CT datasets automatically. The plugin integrates within the Fiji platform to provide reproducible, accessible, and user friendly analysis. The application of the tool demonstrates that the extracted descriptors can be readily incorporated into constitutive models and machine learning workflows, enabling the forward prediction of stress-strain behavior as well as the inverse design of microstructures. This approach supports non-destructive evaluation, accelerates materials selection, and advances the integration of imaging with predictive modeling in porous media research."
2510.17351,"Although Fault Tree and Event Tree analysis are still today the standard approach to system safety analysis for many engineering sectors, these techniques lack the capabilities of fully capturing the realistic, dynamic behaviour of complex systems, which results in a dense network of dependencies at any level, i.e. between components, trains of components or subsystems. While these limitations are well recognised across both industry and academia, the shortage of alternative tools able to tackle such challenges while retaining the computational feasibility of the analysis keeps fuelling the long-lived success of Fault Tree and Event Tree modelling. Analysts and regulators often rely on the use of conservative assumptions to mitigate the effect of oversimplifications associated with the use of such techniques. However, this results in the analysis output to be characterised by an unknown level of conservatism, with potential consequences on market competitiveness (i.e., over-conservatism) or safety (i.e., under-conservatism). This study proposes a generalization of the Dynamic and Dependent Tree Theory, which offers theoretical tools for the systematic integration of dependency modelling within the traditional Fault and Event Tree analysis framework. This is achieved by marrying the traditional combinatorial nature of failure analysis, formalised by the Fault and Event Tree language, with more flexible modelling solutions, which provide the flexibility required to capture complex system features. The main advantage of the proposed approach in comparison to existent solutions is the ability to take into account, under the same modelling framework, any type of dependency regardless of its nature and location, while retaining the familiarity and effectiveness of traditional safety modelling."
2510.17539,"Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality increasing the risk of stroke, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Imageless electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) provides a non invasive alternative to electrical mapping from body surface potentials, but conventional ECGI is confined to epicardial reconstructions and can miss arrhythmias originating in deeper myocardium. We address this by reconstructing three dimensional cardiac activity with a volumetric formulation that solves an inverse source problem via Green's functions, enabling full volume activation mapping and improved localization in anatomically complex regions. We evaluate the approach on simulated premature ventricular beats and on four challenging patient cases, a right ventricular outflow tract premature ventricular contraction, a left bundle branch block, a ventricular tachycardia, and Wolff Parkinson White, and additionally assess performance on an open source myocardial infarction dataset. Results show that volumetric ECGI recovers 3D activation and sharpens arrhythmia origin localization, achieving a 59.3% reduction in geodesic error between estimated and simulated origins relative to surface only methods; in patient cases, activation patterns align with clinical diagnoses. Overall, imageless volumetric ECGI offers accessible, non invasive 3D activation mapping that overcomes a core limitation of surface restricted techniques and may improve preprocedural planning, ablation target guidance, and selection or optimization of cardiac resynchronization therapy."
2511.0039,"The lead-lag effect, where the price movement of one asset systematically precedes that of another, has been widely observed in financial markets and conveys valuable predictive signals for trading. However, traditional lead-lag detection methods are limited by their reliance on statistical analysis methods and by the assumption of persistent lead-lag patterns, which are often invalid in dynamic market conditions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{DeltaLag}, the first end-to-end deep learning method that discovers and exploits dynamic lead-lag structures with pair-specific lag values in financial markets for portfolio construction. Specifically, DeltaLag employs a sparsified cross-attention mechanism to identify relevant lead-lag pairs. These lead-lag signals are then leveraged to extract lag-aligned raw features from the leading stocks for predicting the lagger stock's future return. Empirical evaluations show that DeltaLag substantially outperforms both fixed-lag and self-lead-lag baselines. In addition, its adaptive mechanism for identifying lead-lag relationships consistently surpasses precomputed lead-lag graphs based on statistical methods. Furthermore, DeltaLag outperforms a wide range of temporal and spatio-temporal deep learning models designed for stock prediction or time series forecasting, offering both better trading performance and enhanced interpretability."
2511.0179,"Computational materials discovery relies on the generation of plausible crystal structures. The plausibility is typically judged through density functional theory methods which, while typically accurate at zero Kelvin, often favor low-energy structures that are not experimentally accessible. We develop a combined compositional and structural synthesizability score which provides an accurate way of predicting which compounds can actually be synthesized in a laboratory. We use it to evaluate non-synthesized structures from the Materials Project, GNoME, and Alexandria, and identified several hundred highly synthesizable candidates. We then predict synthesis pathways, conduct corresponding experiments, and characterize the products across 16 targets, successfully synthesizing 7 of 16. The entire experimental process was completed in only three days. Our results highlight omissions in lists of known synthesized structures, deliver insights into the practical utility of current materials databases, and showcase the central role synthesizability prediction can play in materials discovery."
2511.0293,"Understanding current energy consumption behavior in communities is critical for informing future energy use decisions and enabling efficient energy management. Urban energy models, which are used to simulate these energy use patterns, require large datasets with detailed building characteristics for accurate outcomes. However, such detailed characteristics at the individual building level are often unknown and costly to acquire, or unavailable. Through this work, we propose using a generative modeling approach to generate realistic building attributes to fill in the data gaps and finally provide complete characteristics as inputs to energy models. Our model learns complex, building-level patterns from training on a large-scale residential building stock model containing 2.2 million buildings. We employ a tabular diffusion-based framework that is designed to handle heterogeneous (discrete and continuous) features in tabular building data, such as occupancy, floor area, heating, cooling, and other equipment details. We develop a capability for conditional diffusion, enabling the imputation of missing building characteristics conditioned on known attributes. We conduct a comprehensive validation of our conditional diffusion model, firstly by comparing the generated conditional distributions against the underlying data distribution, and secondly, by performing a case study for a Baltimore residential region, showing the practical utility of our approach. Our work is one of the first to demonstrate the potential of generative modeling to accelerate building energy modeling workflows."
2511.0317,"Quantitative structure-activity relationship assumes a smooth relationship between molecular structure and biological activity. However, activity cliffs defined as pairs of structurally similar compounds with large potency differences break this continuity. Recent benchmarks targeting activity cliffs have revealed that classical machine learning models with extended connectivity fingerprints outperform graph neural networks. Our analysis shows that graph embeddings fail to adequately separate structurally similar molecules in the embedding space, making it difficult to distinguish between structurally similar but functionally different molecules. Despite this limitation, molecular graph structures are inherently expressive and attractive, as they preserve molecular topology. To preserve the structural representation of molecules as graphs, we propose a new model, GraphCliff, which integrates short- and long-range information through a gating mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphCliff consistently improves performance on both non-cliff and cliff compounds. Furthermore, layer-wise node embedding analyses reveal reduced over-smoothing and enhanced discriminative power relative to strong baseline graph models."
2511.00319,"Accurate geolocation is essential for the reliable use of GEDI LiDAR data in footprint-scale applications such as aboveground biomass modeling, data fusion, and ecosystem monitoring. However, residual geolocation errors arising from both systematic biases and random ISS-induced jitter can significantly affect the accuracy of derived vegetation and terrain metrics. The main goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a flexible, computationally efficient framework (GEDICorrect) that enables geolocation correction of GEDI data at the orbit, beam, and footprint levels. The framework integrates existing GEDI Simulator modules (gediRat and gediMetrics) and extends their functionality with flexible correction logic, multiple similarity metrics, adaptive footprint clustering, and optimized I/O handling. Using the Kullback--Leibler divergence as the waveform similarity metric, GEDICorrect improved canopy height (RH95) accuracy from $R^2 = 0.61$ (uncorrected) to 0.74 with the orbit-level correction, and up to $R^2 = 0.78$ with the footprint-level correction, reducing RMSE from 2.62~m ($rRMSE = 43.13\%$) to 2.12~m ($rRMSE = 34.97\%$) at the orbit level, and 2.01~m ($rRMSE = 33.05\%$) at the footprint level. Terrain elevation accuracy also improved, decreasing RMSE by 0.34~m relative to uncorrected data and by 0.37~m compared to the GEDI Simulator baseline. In terms of computational efficiency, GEDICorrect achieved a $\sim2.4\times$ speedup over the GEDI Simulator in single-process mode (reducing runtime from $\sim84$~h to $\sim35$~h) and scaled efficiently to 24 cores, completing the same task in $\sim4.3$~h -- an overall $\sim19.5\times$ improvement. GEDICorrect offers a robust and scalable solution for improving GEDI geolocation accuracy while maintaining full compatibility with standard GEDI data products."
2511.00383,"Multi-class tissue-type classification of colorectal cancer (CRC) histopathologic images is a significant step in the development of downstream machine learning models for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, existing public CRC datasets often lack morphologic diversity, suffer from class imbalance, and contain low-quality image tiles, limiting model performance and generalizability. To address these issues, we introduce STARC-9 (STAnford coloRectal Cancer), a large-scale dataset for multi-class tissue classification. STARC-9 contains 630,000 hematoxylin and eosin-stained image tiles uniformly sampled across nine clinically relevant tissue classes (70,000 tiles per class) from 200 CRC patients at the Stanford University School of Medicine. The dataset was built using a novel framework, DeepCluster++, designed to ensure intra-class diversity and reduce manual curation. First, an encoder from a histopathology-specific autoencoder extracts feature vectors from tiles within each whole-slide image. Then, K-means clustering groups morphologically similar tiles, followed by equal-frequency binning to sample diverse morphologic patterns within each class. The selected tiles are subsequently verified by expert gastrointestinal pathologists to ensure accuracy. This semi-automated process significantly reduces manual effort while producing high-quality, diverse tiles. To evaluate STARC-9, we benchmarked convolutional neural networks, transformers, and pathology-specific foundation models on multi-class CRC tissue classification and segmentation tasks, showing superior generalizability compared to models trained on existing datasets. Although we demonstrate the utility of DeepCluster++ on CRC as a pilot use-case, it is a flexible framework that can be used for constructing high-quality datasets from large WSI repositories across a wide range of cancer and non-cancer applications."
2511.00884,"Autonomous navigation of UAV swarms in perceptually-degraded environments, where GPS is unavailable and terrain is densely cluttered, presents a critical bottleneck for real-world deployment. Existing optimization-based planners lack the resilience to avoid catastrophic convergence to local optima under such uncertainty. Inspired by principles of computational meta-cognition, this paper introduces a novel swarm intelligence framework that enables a fleet of UAVs to autonomously sense, adapt, and recover from planning failures in real-time. At its core is the Self-Learning Slime Mould Algorithm (SLSMA), which integrates three meta-cognitive layers: a situation-aware search strategy that dynamically selects between exploration and exploitation based on perceived search stagnation; a collective memory mechanism that allows the swarm to learn from and avoid previously failed trajectories; and an adaptive recovery behavior that triggers global re-exploration upon entrapment. We formulate the multi-UAV trajectory problem as a resilient planning challenge, with a cost function that penalizes not only path length and collisions but also navigational uncertainty and proximity to failure states. Extensive simulations in synthetically complex 3D worlds and against the CEC 2017 benchmark suite demonstrate the framework's superior performance. The SLSMA does not merely optimize paths; it generates resilient trajectories, demonstrating a 99.5% mission success rate and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art metaheuristics in recovery speed and solution reliability. This work provides a foundational step towards truly autonomous swarms capable of persistent operation in denied and dynamic environments."
2511.01298,"Quantum inspired evolutionary optimization leverages quantum computing principles like superposition, interference, and probabilistic representation to enhance classical evolutionary algorithms with improved exploration and exploitation capabilities. Implemented on NVIDIA Tesla V100 SXM2 GPUs, this study systematically investigates the performance and scalability of a GPU-accelerated Quantum Inspired Evolutionary Optimizer applied to large scale 01 Knapsack problems. By exploiting CUDA`s parallel processing capabilities, particularly through optimized memory management and thread configuration, significant speedups and efficient utilization of GPU resources is demonstrated. The analysis covers various problem sizes, kernel launch configurations, and memory models including constant, shared, global, and pinned memory, alongside extensive scaling studies. The results reveal that careful tuning of memory strategies and kernel configurations is essential for maximizing throughput and efficiency, with constant memory providing superior performance up to hardware limits. Beyond these limits, global memory and strategic tiling become necessary, albeit with some performance trade offs. The findings highlight both the promise and the practical constraints of applying QIEO on GPUs for complex combinatorial optimization, offering actionable insights for future large scale metaheuristic implementations."
2511.01318,"The stock market is a complex and dynamic system, where it is non-trivial for researchers and practitioners to uncover underlying patterns and forecast stock movements. The existing studies for stock market analysis rely on leveraging various types of information to extract useful factors, which are highly conditional on the quality of the data used. However, the currently available resources are mainly based on the U.S. stock market in English, which is inapplicable to adapt to other countries. To address these issues, we propose CSMD, a multimodal dataset curated specifically for analyzing the Chinese stock market with meticulous processing for validated quality. In addition, we develop a lightweight and user-friendly framework LightQuant for researchers and practitioners with expertise in financial domains. Experimental results on top of our datasets and framework with various backbone models demonstrate their effectiveness compared with using existing datasets.

2511.01701,"A fundamental question in search-guided AI: what topology should guide Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in puzzle solving? Prior work applied topological features to guide MCTS in ARC-style tasks using grid topology -- the Laplacian spectral properties of cell connectivity -- and found no benefit. We identify the root cause: grid topology is constant across all instances. We propose measuring \emph{solution space topology} instead: the structure of valid color assignments constrained by detected pattern rules. We build this via compatibility graphs where nodes are $(cell, color)$ pairs and edges represent compatible assignments under pattern constraints.Our method: (1) detect pattern rules automatically with 100\% accuracy on 5 types, (2) construct compatibility graphs encoding solution space structure, (3) extract topological features (algebraic connectivity, rigidity, color structure) that vary with task difficulty, (4) integrate these features into MCTS node selection via sibling-normalized scores.We provide formal definitions, a rigorous selection formula, and comprehensive ablations showing that algebraic connectivity is the dominant signal. The work demonstrates that topology matters for search -- but only the \emph{right} topology. For puzzle solving, this is solution space structure, not problem space structure."
2511.02211,"We present a Bézier-based Multi-Fidelity Thermal Optimization Framework, which is a computationally efficient methodology for the global optimization of 3D heat sinks. The flexible Bézier-parameterized fin geometries and the adopted multi-fidelity pseudo-3D thermal modeling strategy meet at a balance between accuracy and computational cost. In this method, the smooth and compact Bézier representation of fins defines the design space from which diverse topologies can be generated with minimal design variables. A global optimizer, the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, minimizes the pressure drop with respect to a given surface-average temperature constraint to achieve improvement in the pressure loss. In the framework, the pseudo-3D model couples two thermally interacting 2D layers: a thermofluid layer representing the fluid domain passing through the fins, and a conductive base plate representing the surface where excessive average temperature is to be avoided. Both layers are coupled with calibrated heat transfer coefficients obtained from high-fidelity 3D simulations. For several fin geometries, the proposed framework has been validated by comparing the pseudo-3D results with those of full 3D simulations, which yielded good agreement in terms of temperature distribution and pressure drops when the computational cost was reduced by several orders of magnitude. Optimization results show that it attains up to 50\% pressure loss reduction compared to conventional straight-fin configurations, and it reveals a clear trade-off between thermal performance and hydraulic efficiency. Thus, the proposed method forms a new basis for fast, geometry-flexible, and optimized heat sink design, enabling efficient exploration of complex geometries."
2511.02256,"Motion artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remain a major challenge, as they degrade image quality and compromise diagnostic reliability. Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently shown promise for artifact removal. However, existing 3D SGM-based approaches are limited in two key aspects: (1) their strong dependence on known forward operators makes them ineffective for correcting MRI motion artifacts, and (2) their slow inference speed hinders clinical translation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a wavelet-optimized end-to-end framework for 3D MRI motion correct using pre-trained 2D score priors (3D-WMoCo). Specifically, two orthogonal 2D score priors are leveraged to guide the 3D distribution prior, while a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation (SDE) is employed to model the restoration process of motion-corrupted 3D volumes to motion-free 3D distribution. Furthermore, wavelet diffusion is introduced to accelerate inference, and wavelet convolution is applied to enhance feature extraction. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through both simulated motion artifact experiments and real-world clinical motion artifact correction tests. The proposed method achieves robust performance improvements over existing techniques. Implementation details and source code are available at:this https URL."

2511.02959,"We propose a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) framework for finite strain incompressible viscoelasticity within the generalized standard materials theory. The formulation is based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient and enforces unimodularity of the inelastic deformation part throughout the evolution. Invariant-based representations of the free energy and the dual dissipation potential by monotonic and fully input-convex neural networks ensure thermodynamic consistency, objectivity, and material symmetry by construction. The evolution of the internal variables during training is handled by solving the evolution equations using an implicit exponential time integrator. In addition, a trainable gate layer combined with lp regularization automatically identifies the required number of internal variables during training. The PANN is calibrated with synthetic and experimental data, showing excellent agreement for a wide range of deformation rates and different load paths. We also show that the proposed model achieves excellent interpolation as well as plausible and accurate extrapolation behaviors. In addition, we demonstrate consistency of the PANN with linear viscoelasticity by linearization of the full model."
2511.02962,"The solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) plays a central role in numerous applications in science and engineering, particularly those involving multiphase flow in porous media. Complex, nonlinear systems govern these problems and are notoriously computationally intensive, especially in real-world applications and reservoirs. Recent advances in deep learning have spurred the development of data-driven surrogate models that approximate PDE solutions with reduced computational cost. Among these, Neural Operators such as Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) have shown strong potential for learning parameter-to-solution mappings, enabling the generalization across families of PDEs. However, both methods face challenges when applied independently to complex porous media flows, including high memory requirements and difficulty handling the time dimension. To address these limitations, this work introduces hybrid neural operator surrogates based on DeepONet models that integrate Fourier Neural Operators, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within their branch and trunk networks. The proposed framework decouples spatial and temporal learning tasks by splitting these structures into the branch and trunk networks, respectively. We evaluate these hybrid models on multiphase flow in porous media problems ranging in complexity from the steady 2D Darcy flow to the 2D and 3D problems belonging to the $10$th Comparative Solution Project from the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Results demonstrate that hybrid schemes achieve accurate surrogate modeling with significantly fewer parameters while maintaining strong predictive performance on large-scale reservoir simulations."
2511.03499,"Marine invasive species spread through global shipping and generate substantial ecological and economic impacts. Traditional risk assessments require detailed records of ballast water and traffic patterns, which are often incomplete, limiting global coverage. This work advances a theoretical framework that quantifies invasion risk by combining environmental similarity across ports with observed and forecasted maritime mobility. Climate-based feature representations characterize each port's marine conditions, while mobility networks derived from Automatic Identification System data capture vessel flows and potential transfer pathways. Clustering and metric learning reveal climate analogues and enable the estimation of species survival likelihood along shipping routes. A temporal link prediction model captures how traffic patterns may change under shifting environmental conditions. The resulting fusion of environmental similarity and predicted mobility provides exposure estimates at the port and voyage levels, supporting targeted monitoring, routing adjustments, and management interventions."
2511.03684,"Persistent cost and schedule deviations remain a major challenge in the U.S. construction industry, revealing the limitations of deterministic CPM and static document-based estimating. This study presents an integrated 4D/5D digital-twin framework that couples Building Information Modeling (BIM) with natural-language processing (NLP)-based cost mapping, computer-vision (CV)-driven progress measurement, Bayesian probabilistic CPM updating, and deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) resource-leveling. A nine-month case implementation on a Dallas-Fort Worth mid-rise project demonstrated measurable gains in accuracy and efficiency: 43% reduction in estimating labor, 6% reduction in overtime, and 30% project-buffer utilization, while maintaining an on-time finish at 128 days within P50-P80 confidence bounds. The digital-twin sandbox also enabled real-time ""what-if"" forecasting and traceable cost-schedule alignment through a 5D knowledge graph. Findings confirm that integrating AI-based analytics with probabilistic CPM and DRL enhances forecasting precision, transparency, and control resilience. The validated workflow establishes a practical pathway toward predictive, adaptive, and auditable construction management."
2511.03711,"This work introduces a surrogate-based model for efficiently estimating the frequency response of dynamic mechanical metamaterials, particularly when dealing with large parametric perturbations and aperiodic substructures. The research builds upon a previous matrix interpolation method applied on top of a Craig-Bampton modal reduction, allowing the variations of geometrical features without the need to remesh and recompute Finite Element matrices. This existing procedure has significant limitations since it requires a common modal projection, which inherently restricts the allowable perturbation size of the model parameters, thereby limiting the model parameter space where matrices can be effectively interpolated. The present work offers three contributions: (1) It provides structural dynamic insight into the restrictions imposed by the common modal projection, demonstrating that ill-conditioning can be controlled, (2) it proposes an efficient, sampling-based procedure to identify the non-regular boundaries of the usable region in the model parameter space, and (3) it enhances the surrogate model to accommodate larger model parameter perturbations by proposing a multi-region interpolation strategy. The efficacy of this proposed framework is verified through two illustrative examples. The first example, involving a unit cell with a square plate and circular core, validates the approach for a single well-conditioned projection region. The second example, using a beam-like structure with vibration attenuation bands, demonstrates the true advantage of the multi-region approach, where predictions from traditional Lagrange interpolation deviated significantly with increasing perturbations, while the proposed method maintained high accuracy across different perturbation levels."
2511.04096,"Investigating the mapping between visual stimuli and neural responses in the visual cortex contributes to a deeper understanding of biological visual processing mechanisms. Most existing studies characterize this mapping by training models to directly encode visual stimuli into neural responses or decode neural responses into visual stimuli. However, due to neural response variability and limited neural recording techniques, these studies suffer from overfitting and lack generalizability. Motivated by this challenge, in this paper we shift the tasks from conventional direct encoding and decoding to discriminative encoding and decoding, which are more reasonable. And on top of this we propose a cross-modal alignment approach, named Visual-Neural Alignment (VNA). To thoroughly test the performance of the three methods (direct encoding, direct decoding, and our proposed VNA) on discriminative encoding and decoding tasks, we conduct extensive experiments on three invasive visual cortex datasets, involving two types of subject mammals (mice and macaques). The results demonstrate that our VNA generally outperforms direct encoding and direct decoding, indicating our VNA can most precisely characterize the above visual-neural mapping among the three methods."
2511.04454,"We consider the problem of fitting a reinforcement learning (RL) model to some given behavioral data under a multi-armed bandit environment. These models have received much attention in recent years for characterizing human and animal decision making behavior. We provide a generic mathematical optimization problem formulation for the fitting problem of a wide range of RL models that appear frequently in scientific research applications, followed by a detailed theoretical analysis of its convexity properties. Based on the theoretical results, we introduce a novel solution method for the fitting problem of RL models based on convex relaxation and optimization. Our method is then evaluated in several simulated bandit environments to compare with some benchmark methods that appear in the literature. Numerical results indicate that our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, while significantly reducing computation time. We also provide an open-source Python package for our proposed method to empower researchers to apply it in the analysis of their datasets directly, without prior knowledge of convex optimization."
2511.05383,"Tractography is a unique method for mapping white matter connections in the brain, but tractography algorithms suffer from an inherent trade-off between sensitivity and specificity that limits accuracy. Incorporating prior knowledge of white matter anatomy is an effective strategy for improving accuracy and has been successful for reducing false positives and false negatives in bundle-mapping protocols. However, it is challenging to scale this approach for connectomics due to the difficulty in synthesising information relating to many thousands of possible connections. In this work, we develop and evaluate a pipeline using large language models (LLMs) to generate quantitative priors for connectomics, based on their knowledge of neuroanatomy. We benchmark our approach against an evaluation set derived from a gold-standard tractography atlas, identifying prompting techniques to elicit accurate connectivity information from the LLMs. We further identify strategies for incorporating external knowledge sources into the pipeline, which can provide grounding for the LLM and improve accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how the LLM-derived priors can augment existing tractography filtering approaches by identifying true-positive connections to retain during the filtering process. We show that these additional connections can improve the accuracy of a connectome-based model of pathology spread, which provides supporting evidence that the connections preserved by the LLM are valid."
2511.05389,"This paper presents a block-structured formulation of Operator Inference as a way to learn structured reduced-order models for multiphysics systems. The approach specifies the governing equation structure for each physics component and the structure of the coupling terms. Once the multiphysics structure is specified, the reduced-order model is learned from snapshot data following the nonintrusive Operator Inference methodology. In addition to preserving physical system structure, which in turn permits preservation of system properties such as stability and second-order structure, the block-structured approach has the advantages of reducing the overall dimensionality of the learning problem and admitting tailored regularization for each physics component. The numerical advantages of the block-structured formulation over a monolithic Operator Inference formulation are demonstrated for aeroelastic analysis, which couples aerodynamic and structural models. For the benchmark test case of the AGARD 445.6 wing, block-structured Operator Inference provides an average 20% online prediction speedup over monolithic Operator Inference across subsonic and supersonic flow conditions in both the stable and fluttering parameter regimes while preserving the accuracy achieved with monolithic Operator Inference."
2511.06649,"Long-tail motion forecasting is a core challenge for autonomous driving, where rare yet safety-critical events-such as abrupt maneuvers and dense multi-agent interactions-dominate real-world risk. Existing approaches struggle in these scenarios because they rely on either non-interpretable clustering or model-dependent error heuristics, providing neither a differentiable notion of ""tailness"" nor a mechanism for rapid adaptation. We propose SAML, a Semantic-Aware Meta-Learning framework that introduces the first differentiable definition of tailness for motion forecasting. SAML quantifies motion rarity via semantically meaningful intrinsic (kinematic, geometric, temporal) and interactive (local and global risk) properties, which are fused by a Bayesian Tail Perceiver into a continuous, uncertainty-aware Tail Index. This Tail Index drives a meta-memory adaptation module that couples a dynamic prototype memory with an MAML-based cognitive set mechanism, enabling fast adaptation to rare or evolving patterns. Experiments on nuScenes, NGSIM, and HighD show that SAML achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and substantial gains on top 1-5% worst-case events, while maintaining high efficiency. Our findings highlight semantic meta-learning as a pathway toward robust and safety-critical motion forecasting."
2511.07014,"Probabilistic forecasting is crucial in multivariate financial time-series for constructing efficient portfolios that account for complex cross-sectional dependencies. In this paper, we propose Diffolio, a diffusion model designed for multivariate financial time-series forecasting and portfolio construction. Diffolio employs a denoising network with a hierarchical attention architecture, comprising both asset-level and market-level layers. Furthermore, to better reflect cross-sectional correlations, we introduce a correlation-guided regularizer informed by a stable estimate of the target correlation matrix. This structure effectively extracts salient features not only from historical returns but also from asset-specific and systematic covariates, significantly enhancing the performance of forecasts and portfolios. Experimental results on the daily excess returns of 12 industry portfolios show that Diffolio outperforms various probabilistic forecasting baselines in multivariate forecasting accuracy and portfolio performance. Moreover, in portfolio experiments, portfolios constructed from Diffolio's forecasts show consistently robust performance, thereby outperforming those from benchmarks by achieving higher Sharpe ratios for the mean-variance tangency portfolio and higher certainty equivalents for the growth-optimal portfolio. These results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed Diffolio in terms of not only statistical accuracy but also economic significance."
2511.07138,"We consider the thermal dunking problem, in which a solid body is suddenly immersed in a fluid of different temperature, and study both the temporal evolution of the solid and the associated Biot number -- a non-dimensional heat transfer coefficient characterizing heat exchange across the solid-fluid interface. We focus on the small-Biot-number regime. The problem is accurately described by the conjugate heat transfer (CHT) formulation, which couples the Navier-Stokes and energy equations in the fluid with the heat equation in the solid through interfacial continuity conditions. Because full CHT simulations are computationally expensive, simplified models are often used in practice. Starting from the coupled equations, we systematically reduce the formulation to the lumped-capacitance model, a single ordinary differential equation with a closed-form solution, based on two assumptions: time scale separation and a spatially uniform solid temperature. The total modeling error is decomposed into time homogenization and lumping contributions. We derive an asymptotic error bound for the lumping error, valid for general heterogeneous solids and spatially varying heat transfer coefficients. Building on this theoretical result, we introduce a computable upper bound expressed in measurable quantities for practical evaluation. Time scale separation is analyzed theoretically and supported by physical arguments and simulations, showing that large separation yields small time homogenization errors. In practice, the Biot number must be estimated from so-called empirical correlations, which are typically limited to specific canonical geometries. We propose a data-driven framework that extends empirical correlations to a broader range of geometries through learned characteristic length scales. All results are validated by direct numerical simulations up to Reynolds numbers of 10,000."
