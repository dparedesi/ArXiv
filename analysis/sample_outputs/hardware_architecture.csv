2501.00642,"Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents are transforming the programming language landscape by facilitating learning for beginners, enabling code generation, and optimizing documentation workflows. Hardware Description Languages (HDLs), with their smaller user community, stand to benefit significantly from the application of LLMs as tools for learning new HDLs. This paper investigates the challenges and solutions of enabling LLMs for HDLs, particularly for HDLs that LLMs have not been previously trained on. This work introduces HDLAgent, an AI agent optimized for LLMs with limited knowledge of various HDLs. It significantly enhances off-the-shelf LLMs."
2501.00921,"In current chip design processes, using multiple tools to obtain a gate-level netlist often results in the loss of source code correlation. SynAlign addresses this challenge by automating the alignment process, simplifying iterative design, reducing overhead, and maintaining correlation across various tools. This enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of chip design workflows.Improving characteristics such as frequency through iterative design is essential for enhancing accelerators and chip designs. While synthesis tools produce netlists with critical path information, designers often lack the tools to trace these netlist cells back to their original source code. Mapping netlist components to source code provides early feedback on timing and power for frontend designers.SynAlign automatically aligns post-optimized netlists with the original source code without altering compilers or synthesis processes. Its alignment strategy relies on the consistent design structure throughout the chip design cycle, even with changes in compiler flow. This consistency allows engineers to maintain a correlation between modified designs and the original source code across various tools. Remarkably, SynAlign can tolerate up to 61\% design net changes without impacting alignment accuracy."
2501.01147,"This project focuses on the design and implementation of an AHB to APB Bridge for efficient communication in System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. The Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) is used for high-speed operations, typically connecting processors and memory, while the Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) is optimized for low-power, low-speed peripheral devices. The AHB to APB Bridge serves as an interface that converts complex, high-speed AHB transactions into simpler, single-cycle APB transactions, enabling seamless data transfer between fast components and slower peripherals. The bridge manages clock domain synchronization, transaction conversion, and flow control, ensuring compatibility between AHB's burst transfers and APB's non-pipelined protocol. Implemented in Verilog and simulated on FPGA using Xilinx Vivado, this bridge design provides a robust solution for integrating high-performance and low-power components within a single SoC. This project also evaluates the bridge's functionality and performance through testbenches covering various operational scenarios, validating its efficiency in handling diverse system requirements."
2501.01259,"In the field of digital signal processing, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a fundamental algorithm, with its processors being implemented using either the pipelined architecture, well-known for high-throughput applications but weak in hardware utilization, or the memory-based architecture, designed for area-constrained scenarios but failing to meet stringent throughput requirements. Therefore, we propose an adaptive hybrid FFT, which leverages the strengths of both pipelined and memory-based architectures. In this paper, we propose an adaptive hybrid FFT processor that combines the advantages of both architectures, and it has the following features. First, a set of radix-$2^k$ multi-path delay commutators (MDC) units are developed to support high-performance large-size processing. Second, a conflict-free memory access scheme is formulated to ensure a continuous data flow without data contention. Third, We demonstrate the existence of a series of bit-dimension permutations for reordering input data, satisfying the generalized constraints of variable-length, high-radix, and any level of parallelism for wide adaptivity. Furthermore, the proposed FFT processor has been implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). As a result, the proposed work outperforms conventional memory-based FFT processors by requiring fewer computation cycles. It achieves higher hardware utilization than pipelined FFT architectures, making it suitable for highly demanding applications."
2501.01534,"We demonstrate how dynamic verification (e.g. simulation) can be replaced by deductive formal verification and how to benefit from the advantages of symbolic verification and the reuse of verification proofs. To do this, we swap the well-known module-hierarchy based concept with a transaction-level (TL) based alternative, which still allows us to describe the design as precisely as on RTL. We enhance the aspect-oriented and TL oriented language PDVL to support the definition of functional coverage (FC) and assertions at all levels of a TL-hierarchy. We then show how to use a deductive formal verification (DFV) flow which compiles PDVL code into Gallina code to be used by the Coq theorem prover. It can be argued that FC can be converted into proof obligations and that proving them is equivalent to 100\% coverage. We also demonstrate how lower-level proofs can be reused when verifying aspects at higher-levels of a TL-hierarchy. We argue that the traditional assertion-based verification (ABV) methodology is still supported and SVA can be proven using DFV."
2501.01586,"In-memory analog matrix computing (AMC) with resistive random-access memory (RRAM) represents a highly promising solution that solves matrix problems in one step. However, the existing AMC circuits each have a specific connection topology to implement a single computing function, lack of the universality as a matrix processor. In this work, we design a reconfigurable AMC macro for general-purpose matrix computations, which is achieved by configuring proper connections between memory array and amplifier circuits. Based on this macro, we develop a hybrid system that incorporates an on-chip write-verify scheme and digital functional modules, to deliver a general-purpose AMC solver for various applications."
2501.01737,"Digit-serial arithmetic has emerged as a viable approach for designing hardware accelerators, reducing interconnections, area utilization, and power consumption. However, conventional methods suffer from performance and latency issues. To address these challenges, we propose an accelerator design using left-to-right (LR) arithmetic, which performs computations in a most-significant digit first (MSDF) manner, enabling digit-level pipelining. This leads to substantial performance improvements and reduced latency. The processing engine is designed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which includes low-latency LR multipliers and adders for digit-level parallelism. The proposed DSLR-CNN is implemented in Verilog and synthesized with Synopsys design compiler using GSCL 45nm technology, the DSLR-CNN accelerator was evaluated on AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-18 networks. Results show significant improvements across key performance evaluation metrics, including response time, peak performance, power consumption, operational intensity, area efficiency, and energy efficiency. The peak performance measured in GOPS of the proposed design is 4.37x to 569.11x higher than contemporary designs, and it achieved 3.58x to 44.75x higher peak energy efficiency (TOPS/W), outperforming conventional bit-serial designs."
2501.01892,"We introduce QuArch, a dataset of 1500 human-validated question-answer pairs designed to evaluate and enhance language models' understanding of computer architecture. The dataset covers areas including processor design, memory systems, and performance optimization. Our analysis highlights a significant performance gap: the best closed-source model achieves 84% accuracy, while the top small open-source model reaches 72%. We observe notable struggles in memory systems, interconnection networks, and benchmarking. Fine-tuning with QuArch improves small model accuracy by up to 8%, establishing a foundation for advancing AI-driven computer architecture research. The dataset and leaderboard are atthis https URL."
2501.02517,"Although read disturbance has emerged as a major reliability concern, managing read disturbance in modern NAND flash memory has not been thoroughly investigated yet. From a device characterization study using real modern NAND flash memory, we observe that reading a page incurs heterogeneous reliability impacts on each WL, which makes the existing block-level read reclaim extremely inefficient. We propose a new WL-level read-reclaim technique, called STRAW, which keeps track of the accumulated read-disturbance effect on each WL and reclaims only heavily-disturbed WLs. By avoiding unnecessary read-reclaim operations, STRAW reduces read-reclaim-induced page writes by 83.6\% with negligible storage overhead."
2501.02524,"Compute eXpress Link (CXL) is a promising technology for memory disaggregation and expansion. Especially, CXL makes it more effectively for large-capacity storage devices such as Solid State Drive (SSD) to be deployed in the memory pool. However, CXL-based SSDs are still in early stages, necessitating the development of reliable simulation tools. In this paper, we propose CXL-SSD-Sim, the first open-source full-system simulator designed to simulate CXL-based SSD memory system. Constructed on the foundation of gem5 and SimpleSSD, CXL-SSD-Sim extends an high fidelity SSD memory expander model along with the corresponding device driver. In addition, CXL-SSD-Sim models a DRAM layer as a caching mechanism for the SSD, meticulously engineered to counteract latency issues inherent to CXL-based SSD memory access. Experiments are performed among five different memory devices with CXL-SSD-Sim in aspect of latency, bandwidth and real-world benchmark performance. These experiments serve to underscore the efficacy of our simulation tool in providing a comprehensive analysis of CXL-based SSD memory systems. The CXL-SSD-Sim simulator is available atthis https URL."
2501.04577,"Uncertainty estimation is an indispensable capability for AI-enabled, safety-critical applications, e.g. autonomous vehicles or medical diagnosis. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) use Bayesian statistics to provide both classification predictions and uncertainty estimation, but they suffer from high computational overhead associated with random number generation and repeated sample iterations. Furthermore, BNNs are not immediately amenable to acceleration through compute-in-memory architectures due to the frequent memory writes necessary after each RNG operation. To address these challenges, we present an ASIC that integrates 360 fJ/Sample Gaussian RNG directly into the SRAM memory words. This integration reduces RNG overhead and enables fully-parallel compute-in-memory operations for BNNs. The prototype chip achieves 5.12 GSa/s RNG throughput and 102 GOp/s neural network throughput while occupying 0.45 mm2, bringing AI uncertainty estimation to edge computation."
2501.04627,"An ADC is used to convert analog signals into binary signals. Compared with many other types of ADCs, flash converters are incredibly quick. A typical Flash ADC consists of 2n resistors, 2n-1 op-amp comparators, and an encoder which requires more area. The resistors and comparators can be eliminated by using threshold inverter quantization (TIQ) comparators. As a voltage comparator, TIQ technique uses two cascaded CMOS inverters. So that there will be no variation in the fabrication process, and temperature. A 6-bit flash ADC based on threshold inverter quantization (TIQ) comparator was designed and software implementation was performed employing a fat tree encoder with 0.25 micrometer CMOS technology. The design consists of 2n-1 TIQ comparator arrays, a gain booster, a 1-out-of-n code generator, and a fat tree encoder. This TIQ flash ADC is simulated with the Tanner EDA Tool. Here the supply voltage is 2.5 V, input frequency of 10 kHz and 10 MHz. The power consumption of the ADC is 6.25 mW, and the propagation delay is 1.07 microseconds for 10 kHz input frequency. For 10 MHz input frequency, power consumption is 12.12 mW and propagation delay is 947.14 ms."
2501.05033,"Network coding enhances performance in network communications and distributed storage by increasing throughput and robustness while reducing latency. Batched Sparse (BATS) codes are a class of capacity-achieving network codes, but their practical applications are hindered by their structure, computational intensity, and power demands of finite field operations. Most literature focuses on algorithmic-level techniques to improve coding efficiency. Optimization with an algorithm/hardware co-designing approach has long been neglected. Leveraging the unique structure of BATS codes, we first present CS-BATS, a hardware-friendly variant. Next we propose a simple but effective bounded-value generator, to reduce the size of a finite field multiplier by up to 70%. Finally, we report on a scalable and resource-efficient FPGA-based network coding accelerator that achieves a throughput of 27 Gbps, a speedup of more than 300 over software."
2501.0547,"Optimizing Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code is crucial for improving hardware PPA performance. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new approaches for automatic RTL code generation and optimization. However, existing methods often lack decision interpretability (sufficient, understandable justification for decisions), making it difficult for hardware engineers to trust the generated results, thus preventing these methods from being integrated into the design process. To address this, we propose RTLSquad, a novel LLM-Based Multi-Agent system for interpretable RTL code generation. RTLSquad divides the design process into exploration, implementation, and verification & evaluation stages managed by specialized agent squads, generating optimized RTL code through inter-agent collaboration, and providing decision interpretability through the communication process. Experiments show that RTLSquad excels in generating functionally correct RTL code and optimizing PPA performance, while also having the capability to provide decision paths, demonstrating the practical value of our system."
2501.0568,"Over the past few years, diffusion models have emerged as novel AI solutions, generating diverse multi-modal outputs from text prompts. Despite their capabilities, they face challenges in computing, such as excessive latency and energy consumption due to their iterative architecture. Although prior works specialized in transformer acceleration can be applied, the iterative nature of diffusion models remains unresolved. In this paper, we present EXION, the first SW-HW co-designed diffusion accelerator that solves the computation challenges by exploiting the unique inter- and intra-iteration output sparsity in diffusion models. To this end, we propose two SW-level optimizations. First, we introduce the FFN-Reuse algorithm that identifies and skips redundant computations in FFN layers across different iterations (inter-iteration sparsity). Second, we use a modified eager prediction method that employs two-step leading-one detection to accurately predict the attention score, skipping unnecessary computations within an iteration (intra-iteration sparsity). We also introduce a novel data compaction mechanism named ConMerge, which can enhance HW utilization by condensing and merging sparse matrices into compact forms. Finally, it has a dedicated HW architecture that supports the above sparsity-inducing algorithms, translating high output sparsity into improved energy efficiency and performance. To verify the feasibility of the EXION, we first demonstrate that it has no impact on accuracy in various types of multi-modal diffusion models. We then instantiate EXION in both server- and edge-level settings and compare its performance against GPUs with similar specifications. Our evaluation shows that EXION achieves dramatic improvements in performance and energy efficiency by 3.2-379.3x and 45.1-3067.6x compared to a server GPU and by 42.6-1090.9x and 196.9-4668.2x compared to an edge GPU."
2501.06043,"General matrix multiplication (GeMM) is a core operation in virtually all AI applications. Systolic array (SA) based architectures have shown great promise as GeMM hardware accelerators thanks to their speed and energy efficiency. Unfortunately, SAs incur a linear delay in filling the operands, due to unidirectional propagation via pipeline latches. In this work, we propose a novel in-array data orchestration technique in SAs where we enable data feeding on the principal diagonal followed by bi-directional propagation. This improves the runtime by up to 2X at minimal hardware overhead. In addition, the proposed data orchestration enables convolution lowering (known as im2col) using a simple hardware support to fully exploit input feature map reuse opportunity and significantly lower the off-chip memory traffic resulting in 1.2X throughput improvement and 2.17X inference energy reduction during YOLOv3 and RESNET50 workload on average. In contrast, conventional data orchestration would require more elaborate hardware and control signals to implement im2col in hardware because of the data skew. We have synthesized and conducted place and route for 16X16 systolic arrays based on the novel and conventional orchestrations using ASAP 7nm PDK and found that our proposed approach results in 0.211% area and 1.6% power overheads."
2501.0678,"Recently, crossbar array based in-memory accelerators have been gaining interest due to their high throughput and energy efficiency. While software and compiler support for the in-memory accelerators has also been introduced, they are currently limited to the case where all weights are assumed to be on-chip. This limitation becomes apparent with the significantly increasing network sizes compared to the in-memory footprint.Weight replacement schemes are essential to address this issue. We propose COMPASS, a compiler framework for resource-constrained crossbar-based processing-in-memory (PIM) deep neural network (DNN) accelerators. COMPASS is specially targeted for networks that exceed the capacity of PIM crossbar arrays, necessitating access to external memories. We propose an algorithm to determine the optimal partitioning that divides the layers so that each partition can be accelerated on chip. Our scheme takes into account the data dependence between layers, core utilization, and the number of write instructions to minimize latency, memory accesses, and improve energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that COMPASS can accommodate much more networks using a minimal memory footprint, while improving throughput by 1.78X and providing 1.28X savings in energy-delay product (EDP) over baseline partitioning methods."
2501.0733,"ML and HPC applications increasingly combine dense and sparse memory access computations to maximize storage efficiency. However, existing CPUs and GPUs struggle to flexibly handle these heterogeneous workloads with consistently high compute efficiency. We present Occamy, a 432-Core, 768-DP-GFLOP/s, dual-HBM2E, dual-chiplet RISC-V system with a latency-tolerant hierarchical interconnect and in-core streaming units (SUs) designed to accelerate dense and sparse FP8-to-FP64 ML and HPC workloads. We implement Occamy's compute chiplets in 12 nm FinFET, and its passive interposer, Hedwig, in a 65 nm node. On dense linear algebra (LA), Occamy achieves a competitive FPU utilization of 89%. On stencil codes, Occamy reaches an FPU utilization of 83% and a technology-node-normalized compute density of 11.1 DP-GFLOP/s/mm2,leading state-of-the-art (SoA) processors by 1.7x and 1.2x, respectively. On sparse-dense linear algebra (LA), it achieves 42% FPU utilization and a normalized compute density of 5.95 DP-GFLOP/s/mm2, surpassing the SoA by 5.2x and 11x, respectively. On, sparse-sparse LA, Occamy reaches a throughput of up to 187 GCOMP/s at 17.4 GCOMP/s/W and a compute density of 3.63 GCOMP/s/mm2. Finally, we reach up to 75% and 54% FPU utilization on and dense (LLM) and graph-sparse (GCN) ML inference workloads. Occamy's RTL is freely available under a permissive open-source license."
2501.07767,"Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure for many embedded applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. Current Point Cloud Networks (PCNs) have proven to achieve great success in using inference to perform point cloud analysis, including object part segmentation, shape classification, and so on. However, point cloud applications on the computing edge require more than just the inference step. They require an end-to-end (E2E) processing of the point cloud workloads: pre-processing of raw data, input preparation, and inference to perform point cloud analysis. Current PCN approaches to support end-to-end processing of point cloud workload cannot meet the real-time latency requirement on the edge, i.e., the ability of the AI service to keep up with the speed of raw data generation by 3D sensors. Latency for end-to-end processing of the point cloud workloads stems from two reasons: memory-intensive down-sampling in the pre-processing phase and the data structuring step for input preparation in the inference phase. In this paper, we present HgPCN, an end-to-end heterogeneous architecture for real-time embedded point cloud applications. In HgPCN, we introduce two novel methodologies based on spatial indexing to address the two identified bottlenecks. In the Pre-processing Engine of HgPCN, an Octree-Indexed-Sampling method is used to optimize the memory-intensive down-sampling bottleneck of the pre-processing phase. In the Inference Engine, HgPCN extends a commercial DLA with a customized Data Structuring Unit which is based on a Voxel-Expanded Gathering method to fundamentally reduce the workload of the data structuring step in the inference phase."
2501.07825,"Recently, large models, such as Vision Transformer and BERT, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional performance. However, their extensive computational requirements lead to considerable power and hardware resource consumption. Brain-inspired computing, characterized by its spike-driven methods, has emerged as a promising approach for low-power hardware implementation. In this paper, we propose an efficient sparse hardware accelerator for Spike-driven Transformer. We first design a novel encoding method that encodes the position information of valid activations and skips non-spike values. This method enables us to use encoded spikes for executing the calculations of linear, maxpooling and spike-driven self-attention. Compared with the single spike input design of conventional SNN accelerators that primarily focus on convolution-based spiking computations, the specialized module for spike-driven self-attention is unique in its ability to handle dual spike inputs. By exclusively utilizing activated spikes, our design fully exploits the sparsity of Spike-driven Transformer, which diminishes redundant operations, lowers power consumption, and minimizes computational latency. Experimental results indicate that compared to existing SNNs accelerators, our design achieves up to 13.24$\times$ and 1.33$\times$ improvements in terms of throughput and energy efficiency, respectively."
2501.08071,"Large language models (LLMs) are remarked by their substantial computational requirements. To mitigate the cost, researchers develop specialized CUDA kernels, which often fuse several tensor operations to maximize the utilization of GPUs as much as possible. However, those specialized kernels may still leave performance on the table as CUDA assembly experts show that manual optimization of GPU SASS schedules can lead to better performance, and trial-and-error is largely employed to manually find the best GPU SASS schedules.In this work, we employ an automatic approach to optimize GPU SASS schedules, which thus can be integrated into existing compiler frameworks. The key to automatic optimization is training an RL agent to mimic how human experts perform manual scheduling. To this end, we formulate an assembly game, where RL agents can play to find the best GPU SASS schedules. The assembly game starts from a \textit{-O3} optimized SASS schedule, and the RL agents can iteratively apply actions to mutate the current schedules. Positive rewards are generated if the mutated schedules get higher throughput by executing on GPUs. Experiments show that CuAsmRL can further improve the performance of existing specialized CUDA kernels transparently by up to $26\%$, and on average $9\%$. Moreover, it is used as a tool to reveal potential optimization moves learned automatically."
2501.08645,"Efficient communication is central to both biological and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. In biological brains, the challenge of long-range communication across regions is addressed through sparse, spike-based signaling, minimizing energy and latency. Conversely, modern AI workloads are increasingly constrained by bandwidth, leading to bottlenecks that hamper scalability and efficiency. Inspired by the brain's ability to execute dynamic and complex local computations coupled with sparse inter-neuron communication, we propose heterogeneous neural networks that combine spiking neural networks (SNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) at bandwidth-limited regions, such as chip boundaries, where spike-based communication reduces data transfer overhead. Within each chip, dense ANN computations maintain high throughput, accuracy, and robustness. While SNNs have struggled to algorithmically scale, our approach surmounts this long-standing challenge through algorithm-architecture co-design where learnable sparsity is employed for die-to-die communication by confining spiking layers to specific partitions. This composable design combines high ANN performance with low-bandwidth SNN efficiency. Evaluations on language processing and computer vision exhibit up to 5.3x energy efficiency gains and 15.2x latency reductions, surpassing both purely spiking and non-spiking models. As model size grows, improvements scale accordingly. By targeting the inter-chip communication bottleneck with biologically inspired methods, this approach presents a promising path to more efficient AI systems."
2501.08889,"While the Karatsuba algorithm reduces the complexity of large integer multiplication, the extra additions required minimize its benefits for smaller integers of more commonly-used bitwidths. In this work, we propose the extension of the scalar Karatsuba multiplication algorithm to matrix multiplication, showing how this maintains the reduction in multiplication complexity of the original Karatsuba algorithm while reducing the complexity of the extra additions. Furthermore, we propose new matrix multiplication hardware architectures for efficiently exploiting this extension of the Karatsuba algorithm in custom hardware. We show that the proposed algorithm and hardware architectures can provide real area or execution time improvements for integer matrix multiplication compared to scalar Karatsuba or conventional matrix multiplication algorithms, while also supporting implementation through proven systolic array and conventional multiplier architectures at the core. We provide a complexity analysis of the algorithm and architectures and evaluate the proposed designs both in isolation and in an end-to-end deep learning accelerator system compared to baseline designs and prior state-of-the-art works implemented on the same type of compute platform, demonstrating their ability to increase the performance-per-area of matrix multiplication hardware."
2501.0902,"Compute Express Link (CXL) enables compute ""pods"" with memory pooling across hosts to reduce cost and improve efficiency. Existing pods are small, use exotic many-ported pooling devices, or require indirection through expensive switches. These conventional designs implicitly assume that pods must fully connect all hosts to all CXL pooling devices.This paper breaks with this conventional wisdom to create ""Octopus"" pods. Octopus connects each host to a bounded number of pooling devices (e.g., 8), each pooling device connects to different subsets of hosts, and all host pairs share at least one pooling device. Despite no longer having a global memory pool, we show that Octopus pods still effectively support memory pooling, as well as various communication patterns. Relative to conventional pods, Octopus is more cost-effective (using near-commodity pooling devices) and enables larger pods (allowing more pooling flexibility and greater communication reach).Simulations on production traces show Octopus achieves memory savings comparable to expensive pool designs. Hardware experiments confirm that Octopus reduces RPC latency by 3x compared to RDMA. Our work formalizes Octopus topologies, develops memory allocation algorithms, and evaluates performance tradeoffs through simulation and hardware testing."
2501.09118,"High-level synthesis (HLS) has enabled the rapid development of custom hardware circuits for many software applications. However, developing high-performance hardware circuits using HLS is still a non-trivial task requiring expertise in hardware design. Further, the hardware design space, especially for multi-kernel applications, grows exponentially. Therefore, several HLS automation and abstraction frameworks have been proposed recently, but many issues remain unresolved. These issues include: 1) relying mainly on hardware directives (pragmas) to apply hardware optimizations without exploring loop scheduling opportunities. 2) targeting single-kernel applications only. 3) lacking automatic and/or global design space exploration. 4) missing critical hardware optimizations, such as graph-level pipelining for multi-kernel applications.To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology and framework on top of the popular multi-level intermediate representation (MLIR) infrastructure called Stream-HLS. Our framework takes a C/C++ or PyTorch software code and automatically generates an optimized dataflow architecture along with host code for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). To achieve this, we developed an accurate analytical performance model for global scheduling and optimization of dataflow architectures. Stream-HLS is evaluated using various standard HLS benchmarks and real-world benchmarks from transformer models, convolution neural networks, and multilayer perceptrons. Stream-HLS designs outperform the designs of prior state-of-the-art automation frameworks and manually-optimized designs of abstraction frameworks by up to $79.43\times$ and $10.62\times$ geometric means respectively. Finally, the Stream-HLS framework is modularized, extensible, and open-sourced at \url{this https URL} (\url{this https URL})."
2501.09242,"Customized accelerators have revolutionized modern computing by delivering substantial gains in energy efficiency and performance through hardware specialization. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) play a crucial role in this paradigm, offering unparalleled flexibility and high-performance potential. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and source-to-source compilers have simplified FPGA development by translating high-level programming languages into hardware descriptions enriched with directives. However, achieving high Quality of Results (QoR) remains a significant challenge, requiring intricate code transformations, strategic directive placement, and optimized data communication. This paper presents Prometheus, a holistic optimization framework that integrates key optimizations -- including task fusion, tiling, loop permutation, computation-communication overlap, and concurrent task execution -- into a unified design space. By leveraging Non-Linear Programming (NLP) methodologies, Prometheus explores the optimization space under strict resource constraints, enabling automatic bitstream generation. Unlike existing frameworks, Prometheus considers interdependent transformations and dynamically balances computation and memory access. We evaluate Prometheus across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its ability to maximize parallelism, minimize execution stalls, and optimize data movement. The results showcase its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art FPGA optimization frameworks, highlighting its effectiveness in delivering high QoR while reducing manual tuning efforts."
2501.09588,"Transformer architectures have become the standard neural network model for various machine learning applications including natural language processing and computer vision. However, the compute and memory requirements introduced by transformer models make them challenging to adopt for edge applications. Furthermore, fine-tuning pre-trained transformers (e.g., foundation models) is a common task to enhance the model's predictive performance on specific tasks/applications. Existing transformer accelerators are oblivious to complexities introduced by fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the design of a three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous architecture referred to as Atleus that incorporates heterogeneous computing resources specifically optimized to accelerate transformer models for the dual purposes of fine-tuning and inference. Specifically, Atleus utilizes non-volatile memory and systolic array for accelerating transformer computational kernels using an integrated 3D platform. Moreover, we design a suitable NoC to achieve high performance and energy efficiency. Finally, Atleus adopts an effective quantization scheme to support model compression. Experimental results demonstrate that Atleus outperforms existing state-of-the-art by up to 56x and 64.5x in terms of performance and energy efficiency respectively"
2501.09605,"AI clusters today are one of the major uses of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). However, HBM is suboptimal for AI workloads for several reasons. Analysis shows HBM is overprovisioned on write performance, but underprovisioned on density and read bandwidth, and also has significant energy per bit overheads. It is also expensive, with lower yield than DRAM due to manufacturing complexity. We propose a new memory class: Managed-Retention Memory (MRM), which is more optimized to store key data structures for AI inference workloads. We believe that MRM may finally provide a path to viability for technologies that were originally proposed to support Storage Class Memory (SCM). These technologies traditionally offered long-term persistence (10+ years) but provided poor IO performance and/or endurance. MRM makes different trade-offs, and by understanding the workload IO patterns, MRM foregoes long-term data retention and write performance for better potential performance on the metrics important for these workloads."
2501.09902,"In-cache computing technology transforms existing caches into long-vector compute units and offers low-cost alternatives to building expensive vector engines for mobile CPUs. Unfortunately, existing long-vector Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions, such as RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) and Arm Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), provide only one-dimensional strided and random memory accesses. While this is sufficient for typical vector engines, it fails to effectively utilize the large Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) widths of in-cache vector engines. This is because mobile data-parallel kernels expose limited parallelism across a single dimension.Based on our analysis of mobile vector kernels, we introduce a long-vector Multi-dimensional Vector ISA Extension (MVE) for mobile in-cache computing. MVE achieves high SIMD resource utilization and enables flexible programming by abstracting cache geometry and data layout. The proposed ISA features multi-dimensional strided and random memory accesses and efficient dimension-level masked execution to encode parallelism across multiple dimensions. Using a wide range of data-parallel mobile workloads, we demonstrate that MVE offers significant performance and energy reduction benefits of 2.9x and 8.8x, on average, compared to the SIMD units of a commercial mobile processor, at an area overhead of 3.6%."
2501.10161,"The automotive industry is transitioning from federated, homogeneous, interconnected devices to integrated, heterogeneous, mixed-criticality systems (MCS). This leads to challenges in achieving timing predictability techniques due to access contention on shared resources, which can be mitigated using hardware-based spatial and temporal isolation techniques. Focusing on the interconnect as the point of access for shared resources, we propose AXI-REALM, a lightweight, modular, technology-independent, and open-source real-time extension to AXI4 interconnects. AXI-REALM uses a budget-based mechanism enforced on periodic time windows and transfer fragmentation to provide fair arbitration, coupled with execution predictability on real-time workloads. AXI-REALM features a comprehensive bandwidth and latency monitor at both the ingress and egress of the interconnect system. Latency information is also used to detect and reset malfunctioning subordinates, preventing missed deadlines. We provide a detailed cost assessment in a 12 nm node and an end-to-end case study implementing AXI-REALM into an open-source MCS, incurring an area overhead of less than 2%. When running a mixed-criticality workload, with a time-critical application sharing the interconnect with non-critical applications, we demonstrate that the critical application can achieve up to 68.2% of the isolated performance by enforcing fairness on the interconnect traffic through burst fragmentation, thus reducing the subordinate access latency by up to 24 times. Near-ideal performance, (above 95% of the isolated performance) can be achieved by distributing the available bandwidth in favor of the critical application."
2501.10187,"To match the blooming demand of generative AI workloads, GPU designers have so far been trying to pack more and more compute and memory into single complex and expensive packages. However, there is growing uncertainty about the scalability of individual GPUs and thus AI clusters, as state-of-the-art GPUs are already displaying packaging, yield, and cooling limitations. We propose to rethink the design and scaling of AI clusters through efficiently-connected large clusters of Lite-GPUs, GPUs with single, small dies and a fraction of the capabilities of larger GPUs. We think recent advances in co-packaged optics can enable distributing AI workloads onto many Lite-GPUs through high bandwidth and efficient communication. In this paper, we present the key benefits of Lite-GPUs on manufacturing cost, blast radius, yield, and power efficiency; and discuss systems opportunities and challenges around resource, workload, memory, and network management."
2501.10189,"Structured sparsity has been proposed as an efficient way to prune the complexity of Machine Learning (ML) applications and to simplify the handling of sparse data in hardware. Accelerating ML models, whether for training, or inference, heavily relies on matrix multiplications that can be efficiently executed on vector processors, or custom matrix engines. This work aims to integrate the simplicity of structured sparsity into vector execution to speed up the corresponding matrix multiplications. Initially, the implementation of structured-sparse matrix multiplication using the current RISC-V instruction set vector extension is comprehensively explored. Critical parameters that affect performance, such as the impact of data distribution across the scalar and vector register files, data locality, and the effectiveness of loop unrolling are analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the addition of a single new instruction would reap even higher performance. The newly proposed instruction is called vindexmac, i.e., vector index-multiply-accumulate. It allows for indirect reads from the vector register file and it reduces the number of instructions executed per matrix multiplication iteration, without introducing additional dependencies that would limit loop unrolling. The proposed new instruction was integrated in a decoupled RISC-V vector processor with negligible hardware cost. Experimental results demonstrate the runtime efficiency and the scalability offered by the introduced optimizations and the new instruction for the execution of state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks. More particularly, the addition of a custom instruction improves runtime by 25% and 33% when compared with highly-optimized vectorized kernels that use only the currently defined RISC-V instructions."
2501.10301,"The ever-growing scale of data parallelism in today's HPC and ML applications presents a big challenge for computing architectures' energy efficiency and performance. Vector processors address the scale-up challenge by decoupling Vector Register File (VRF) and datapath widths, allowing the VRF to host long vectors and increase register-stored data reuse while reducing the relative cost of instruction fetch and decode. However, even the largest vector processor designs today struggle to scale to more than 8 vector lanes with double-precision Floating Point Units (FPUs) and 256 64-bit elements per vector register. This limitation is induced by difficulties in the physical implementation, which becomes wire-dominated and inefficient. In this work, we present AraXL, a modular and scalable 64-bit RISC-V V vector architecture targeting long-vector applications for HPC and ML. AraXL addresses the physical scalability challenges of state-of-the-art vector processors with a distributed and hierarchical interconnect, supporting up to 64 parallel vector lanes and reaching the maximum Vector Register File size of 64 Kibit/vreg permitted by the RISC-V V 1.0 ISA specification. Implemented in a 22-nm technology node, our 64-lane AraXL achieves a performance peak of 146 GFLOPs on computation-intensive HPC/ML kernels (>99% FPU utilization) and energy efficiency of 40.1 GFLOPs/W (1.15 GHz, TT, 0.8V), with only 3.8x the area of a 16-lane instance."
2501.10658,"The emergence of neural network capabilities invariably leads to a significant surge in computational demands due to expanding model sizes and increased computational complexity. To reduce model size and lower inference costs, recent research has focused on simplifying models and designing hardware accelerators using low-bit quantization. However, due to numerical representation limits, scalar quantization cannot reduce bit width lower than 1-bit, diminishing its benefits. To break through these limitations, we introduce LUT-DLA, a Look-Up Table (LUT) Deep Learning Accelerator Framework that utilizes vector quantization to convert neural network models into LUTs, achieving extreme low-bit quantization. The LUT-DLA framework facilitates efficient and cost-effective hardware accelerator designs and supports the LUTBoost algorithm, which helps to transform various DNN models into LUT-based models via multistage training, drastically cutting both computational and hardware overhead. Additionally, through co-design space exploration, LUT-DLA assesses the impact of various model and hardware parameters to fine-tune hardware configurations for different application scenarios, optimizing performance and efficiency. Our comprehensive experiments show that LUT-DLA achieves improvements in power efficiency and area efficiency with gains of $1.4$~$7.0\times$ and $1.5$~$146.1\times$, respectively, while maintaining only a modest accuracy drop. For CNNs, accuracy decreases by $0.1\%$~$3.1\%$ using the $L_2$ distance similarity, $0.1\%$~$3.4\%$ with the $L_1$ distance similarity, and $0.1\%$~$3.8\%$ when employing the Chebyshev distance similarity. For transformer-based models, the accuracy drop ranges from $1.4\%$ to $3.0\%$."
2501.10682,"The CXL-based solid-state drive (CXL-SSD) provides a promising approach towards scaling the main memory capacity at low cost. However, the CXL-SSD faces performance challenges due to the long flash access latency and unpredictable events such as garbage collection in the SSD device, stalling the host processor and wasting compute cycles. Although the CXL interface enables the byte-granular data access to the SSD, accessing flash chips is still at page granularity due to physical limitations. The mismatch of access granularity causes significant unnecessary I/O traffic to flash chips, worsening the suboptimal end-to-end data access performance. In this paper, we present SkyByte, an efficient CXL-based SSD that employs a holistic approach to address the aforementioned challenges by co-designing the host operating system (OS) and SSD controller. To alleviate the long memory stall when accessing the CXL-SSD, SkyByte revisits the OS context switch mechanism and enables opportunistic context switches upon the detection of long access delays. To accommodate byte-granular data accesses, SkyByte architects the internal DRAM of the SSD controller into a cacheline-level write log and a page-level data cache, and enables data coalescing upon log cleaning to reduce the I/O traffic to flash chips. SkyByte also employs optimization techniques that include adaptive page migration for exploring the performance benefits of fast host memory by promoting hot pages in CXL-SSD to the host. We implement SkyByte with a CXL-SSD simulator and evaluate its efficiency with various data-intensive applications. Our experiments show that SkyByte outperforms current CXL-based SSD by 6.11X, and reduces the I/O traffic to flash chips by 23.08X on average. SkyByte also reaches 75% of the performance of the ideal case that assumes unlimited DRAM capacity in the host, which offers an attractive cost-effective solution."

Some of these applications include communication systems, radar systems, control systems, seismology, speech, music, sonar, finance, image processing, and neural networks. For many real-time applications, the speed at which the spectral analysis is performed is crucial. In order to perform spectral analysis, a Fourier transform is employed. For embedded systems, where spectral analysis is done digitally, a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is employed.

2501.11211,"Diffusion models achieve superior performance in image generation tasks. However, it incurs significant computation overheads due to its iterative structure. To address these overheads, we analyze this iterative structure and observe that adjacent time steps in diffusion models exhibit high value similarity, leading to narrower differences between consecutive time steps. We adapt these characteristics to a quantized diffusion model and reveal that the majority of these differences can be represented with reduced bit-width, and even zero. Based on our observations, we propose the Ditto algorithm, a difference processing algorithm that leverages temporal similarity with quantization to enhance the efficiency of diffusion models. By exploiting the narrower differences and the distributive property of layer operations, it performs full bit-width operations for the initial time step and processes subsequent steps with temporal differences. In addition, Ditto execution flow optimization is designed to mitigate the memory overhead of temporal difference processing, further boosting the efficiency of the Ditto algorithm. We also design the Ditto hardware, a specialized hardware accelerator, fully exploiting the dynamic characteristics of the proposed algorithm. As a result, the Ditto hardware achieves up to 1.5x speedup and 17.74% energy saving compared to other accelerators."
2501.11286,"The wide adoption and substantial computational resource requirements of attention-based Transformers have spurred the demand for efficient hardware accelerators. Unlike digital-based accelerators, there is growing interest in exploring photonics due to its high energy efficiency and ultra-fast processing speeds. However, the significant signal conversion overhead limits the performance of photonic-based accelerators. In this work, we propose HyAtten, a photonic-based attention accelerator with minimize signal conversion overhead. HyAtten incorporates a signal comparator to classify signals into two categories based on whether they can be processed by low-resolution converters. HyAtten integrates low-resolution converters to process all low-resolution signals, thereby boosting the parallelism of photonic computing. For signals requiring high-resolution conversion, HyAtten uses digital circuits instead of signal converters to reduce area and latency overhead. Compared to state-of-the-art photonic-based Transformer accelerator, HyAtten achieves 9.8X performance/area and 2.2X energy-efficiency/area improvement."

2501.12032,"Keeping ML-based recommender models up-to-date as data drifts and evolves is essential to maintain accuracy. As a result, online data preprocessing plays an increasingly important role in serving recommender systems. Existing solutions employ multiple CPU workers to saturate the input bandwidth of a single training node. Such an approach results in high deployment costs and energy consumption. For instance, a recent report from industrial deployments shows that data storage and ingestion pipelines can account for over 60\% of the power consumption in a recommender system. In this paper, we tackle the issue from a hardware perspective by introducing Piper, a flexible and network-attached accelerator that executes data loading and preprocessing pipelines in a streaming fashion. As part of the design, we define MiniPipe, the smallest pipeline unit enabling multi-pipeline implementation by executing various data preprocessing tasks across the single board, giving Piper the ability to be reconfigured at runtime. Our results, using publicly released commercial pipelines, show that Piper, prototyped on a power-efficient FPGA, achieves a 39$\sim$105$\times$ speedup over a server-grade, 128-core CPU and 3$\sim$17$\times$ speedup over GPUs like RTX 3090 and A100 in multiple pipelines. The experimental analysis demonstrates that Piper provides advantages in both latency and energy efficiency for preprocessing tasks in recommender systems, providing an alternative design point for systems that today are in very high demand."
2501.12634,"Modern Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerators are equipped with increasingly larger on-chip buffers to provide more opportunities to alleviate the increasingly severe DRAM bandwidth pressure. However, most existing research on buffer utilization still primarily focuses on single-layer dataflow scheduling optimization. As buffers grow large enough to accommodate most single-layer weights in most networks, the impact of single-layer dataflow optimization on DRAM communication diminishes significantly. Therefore, developing new paradigms that fuse multiple layers to fully leverage the increasingly abundant on-chip buffer resources to reduce DRAM accesses has become particularly important, yet remains an open challenge. To address this challenge, we first identify the optimization opportunities in DRAM communication scheduling by analyzing the drawbacks of existing works on the layer fusion paradigm and recognizing the vast optimization potential in scheduling the timing of data prefetching from and storing to DRAM. To fully exploit these optimization opportunities, we develop a Tensor-centric Notation and its corresponding parsing method to represent different DRAM communication scheduling schemes and depict the overall space of DRAM communication scheduling. Then, to thoroughly and efficiently explore the space of DRAM communication scheduling for diverse accelerators and workloads, we develop an end-to-end scheduling framework, SoMa, which has already been developed into a compiler for our commercial accelerator product. Compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) Cocco framework, SoMa achieves, on average, a 2.11x performance improvement and a 37.3% reduction in energy cost simultaneously. Then, we leverage SoMa to study optimizations for LLM, perform design space exploration (DSE), and analyze the DRAM communication scheduling space through a practical example, yielding some..(more)"

This design allows for the adaptation of various hardware accelerators tailored for different PPO phases. A key innovation is our strategic standardization technique, which combines dynamic reward standardization and block standardization for values, followed by 8-bit uniform quantization. This method stabilizes learning, enhances performance, and manages memory bottlenecks, achieving a 4x reduction in memory usage and a 1.5x increase in cumulative rewards. We propose a solution on a single SoC device with programmable logic and embedded processors, delivering throughput orders of magnitude higher than traditional CPU-GPU systems. Our single-chip solution minimizes communication latency and throughput bottlenecks, significantly boosting PPO training efficiency. Experimental results show a 30% increase in PPO speed and a substantial reduction in memory access time, underscoring HEPPO-GAE's potential for broad applicability in hardware-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms."

In this paper, we propose a novel analog accelerator architecture designed for AI/ML training workloads using stochastic gradient descent with L2 regularization (SGDr). The architecture leverages log-domain circuits in subthreshold MOS and incorporates volatile memory. We establish a mathematical framework for solving SGDr in the continuous time domain and detail the mapping of SGDr learning equations to log-domain circuits. By operating in the analog domain and utilizing weak inversion, the proposed design achieves significant reductions in transistor area and power consumption compared to digital implementations. Experimental results demonstrate that the architecture closely approximates ideal behavior, with a mean square error below 0.87% and precision as low as 8 bits. Furthermore, the architecture supports a wide range of hyperparameters. This work paves the way for energy-efficient analog AI hardware with on-chip training capabilities."
2501.13238,"This paper presents a mixed-mode delay-locked loop (MM-DLL) with binary search (BS) locking, designed to cover a broad frequency range from 533 MHz to 4.26 GHz. The BS locking scheme optimizes the locking time, reducing it from a linear to a logarithmic function, completing in B+1 cycles, where B represents the digital-to-analog (DAC) resolution controlling the voltage-controlled delay line (VCDL). At the start of the BS process, large step sizes can cause significant bias overshoots, potentially leading to clock failure conditions (i.e., clocks fail to propagate through the VCDL). To address this issue, a toggle detector is introduced to monitor clock activity and adjust the binary search controller. Upon detecting a stalled clock, the controller reverts the DAC code to the previous working code and resumes the BS with a reduced step size. Fabricated in a 3-nm FinFET CMOS process, the proposed MM-DLL achieves a locking time of under 10.5 ns while consuming 5.4 mW from a 0.75 V supply at 4.26 GHz. The measured performance includes a high resolution of 0.73 ps, with a static phase error of 0.73 ps, RMS jitter of 1.2 ps, and peak-to-peak jitter of 4.9 ps.

2501.13379,"The softmax function is a widely used activation function in the output layers of neural networks, responsible for converting raw scores into class probabilities while introducing essential non-linearity. Implementing Softmax efficiently poses challenges on low-end FPGAs due to limited hardware resources and the computational complexity of exponential and division operations. This work evaluates approximate computing techniques for softmax acceleration using Taylor series and interpolation methods using Look-Up Tables (LUTs). These approximations aim to reduce execution time and resource consumption while maintaining acceptable levels of numerical precision. Our findings show that quadratic interpolation with LUTs yields the lowest numerical error. In contrast, Taylor-based approximations offer significantly better performance in terms of execution time and resource efficiency due to their computational simplicity. When applied to real-world deep learning models such as LeNet-5 and MobileNet v2, the first- and second-order Taylor approximations provided substantial trade-offs between accuracy and resource savings, achieving up to 0.2% accuracy degradation and 14% resource reduction compared to exact implementations. These results highlight the effectiveness of approximate Softmax designs on resource-constrained FPGAs and lay the groundwork for their integration into larger models, including large language models (LLMs)."

2501.1437,"As computing demand and memory footprint of deep learning applications accelerate, clusters of cores sharing local (L1) multi-banked memory are widely used as key building blocks in large-scale architectures. When the cluster's core count increases, a flat all-to-all interconnect between cores and L1 memory banks becomes a physical implementation bottleneck, and hierarchical network topologies are required. However, hierarchical, multi-level intra-cluster networks are subject to internal contention which may lead to significant performance degradation, especially for SIMD or vector cores, as their memory access is bursty. We present the TCDM Burst Access architecture, a software-transparent burst transaction support to improve bandwidth utilization in clusters with many vector cores tightly coupled to a multi-banked L1 data memory. In our solution, a Burst Manager dispatches burst requests to L1 memory banks, multiple 32b words from burst responses are retired in parallel on channels with parametric data-width.

However, most irregular codes consist of multiple sibling loops, which currently have to be executed sequentially by all HLS tools. Static HLS performs loop fusion only on regular codes, while dynamic HLS relies on loops with dependencies to run to completion before the next loop starts.We present dynamic loop fusion for HLS, a compiler/hardware co-design approach that enables multiple loops to run in parallel, even if they contain unpredictable memory dependencies. Our only requirement is that memory addresses are monotonically non-decreasing in inner loops. We present a novel program-order schedule for HLS, inspired by polyhedral compilers, that together with our address monotonicity analysis enables dynamic memory disambiguation that does not require searching of address histories and sequential loop execution.

2501.17434,"Tree-based data structures are ubiquitous across applications. Therefore, a multitude of different tree implementations exist. However, while these implementations are diverse, they share a tree structure as the underlying data structure. As such, the access patterns inside these trees are very similar, following a path from the root of the tree towards a leaf node. Similarly, many distinct types of memory exist. These types of memory all have different characteristics. Some of these have an impact on the overall system performance. While the concrete types of memory are varied, their characteristics can often be abstracted to have a similar effect on the performance. We show how the characteristics of different types of memories can be used to improve the performance of tree-based data structures. By reordering the nodes of a tree inside memory, the characteristics of memory can be exploited to optimize the performance. To this end, this paper presents different strategies for reordering nodes inside memory as well as efficient algorithms for realizing these strategies. It additionally provides strategies to decide when such a reordering operation should be triggered during operation. Further, this paper conducts experiments showing the performance impact of the proposed strategies. The experiments show that the strategies can improve the performance of trees by up to 95\% as offline optimization and 75\% as online optimization."
2501.17466,"Processing-using-DRAM (PUD) is a paradigm where the analog operational properties of DRAM are used to perform bulk logic operations. While PUD promises high throughput at low energy and area cost, we uncover three limitations of existing PUD approaches that lead to significant inefficiencies: (i) static data representation, i.e., two's complement with fixed bit-precision, leading to unnecessary computation over useless (i.e., inconsequential) data; (ii) support for only throughput-oriented execution, where the high latency of individual PUD operations can only be hidden in the presence of bulk data-level parallelism; and (iii) high latency for high-precision (e.g., 32-bit) operations.To address these issues, we propose Proteus, the first hardware framework that addresses the high execution latency of bulk bitwise PUD operations by implementing a data-aware runtime engine for PUD. Proteus reduces the latency of PUD operations in three different ways: (i) Proteus dynamically reduces the bit-precision (and thus the latency and energy consumption) of PUD operations by exploiting narrow values (i.e., values with many leading zeros or ones); (ii) Proteus concurrently executes independent in-DRAM primitives belonging to a single PUD operation across multiple DRAM arrays; (iii) Proteus chooses and uses the most appropriate data representation and arithmetic algorithm implementation for a given PUD instruction transparently to the programmer."
2501.17567,"The insatiable appetite of Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads for computing power is pushing the industry to develop faster and more efficient accelerators.

In this context, multi-chiplet architectures assembling multiple (perhaps heterogeneous) accelerators are an appealing option that is unfortunately hindered by the still rigid and inefficient chip-to-chip interconnects. In this paper, we explore the potential of wireless technology as a complement to existing wired interconnects in this multi-chiplet approach. Using an evaluation framework from the state-of-the-art, we show that wireless interconnects can lead to speedups of 10% on average and 20% maximum.

2501.17605,"In safety-critical SoC applications such as automotive and aerospace, reliable transaction monitoring is crucial for maintaining system integrity. This paper introduces a drop-in Transaction Monitoring Unit (TMU) for AXI4 subordinate endpoints that detects transaction failures including protocol violations or timeouts and triggers recovery by resetting the affected subordinates. Two TMU variants address different constraints: a Tiny-Counter solution for tightly area-constrained systems and a Full-Counter solution for critical subordinates in mixed-criticality SoCs. The Tiny-Counter employs a single counter per outstanding transaction, while the Full-Counter uses multiple counters to track distinct transaction stages, offering finer-grained monitoring and reducing detection latencies by up to hundreds of cycles at roughly 2.5x the area cost. The Full-Counter also provides detailed error logs for performance and bottleneck analysis. Evaluations at both IP and system levels confirm the TMU's effectiveness and low overhead. In GF12 technology, monitoring 16-32 outstanding transactions occupies 1330-2616 um2 for the Tiny-Counter and 3452-6787 um2 for the Full-Counter; moderate prescaler steps reduce these figures by 18-39% and 19-32%, respectively, with no loss of functionality.

These devices must be energy efficient to minimize battery size, improve comfort, and reduce recharging intervals. This paper investigates the use of specialized low-precision arithmetic formats to enhance the energy efficiency of biomedical wearables. Specifically, we explore posit arithmetic, a floating-point-like representation, in two key applications: cough detection for chronic cough monitoring and R peak detection in ECG analysis. Simulations reveal that 16-bit posits can replace 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point numbers with minimal accuracy loss in cough detection. For R peak detection, posit arithmetic achieves satisfactory accuracy with as few as 10 or 8 bits, compared to the 16-bit requirement for floating-point formats. To further this exploration, we introduce PHEE, a modular and extensible architecture that integrates the Coprosit posit coprocessor within a RISC-V-based system. Using the X-HEEP framework, PHEE seamlessly incorporates posit arithmetic, demonstrating reduced hardware area and power consumption compared to a floating-point counterpart system. Post-synthesis results targeting 16nm TSMC technology show that the posit hardware targeting these biomedical applications can be 38% smaller and consume up to 54% less energy at the functional unit level, with no performance compromise. These findings establish the potential of low-precision posit arithmetic to significantly improve the energy efficiency of wearable biomedical devices."

At its heart, FLASH-FHE designs two types of computation clusters, ie, bootstrappable and swift, to optimize for deep and shallow workloads respectively in terms of cryptographic parameters and hardware pipelines. We organize one bootstrappable and two swift clusters into one cluster affiliation, and present a scheduling scheme that provides sufficient acceleration for deep FHE workloads by utilizing all the affiliations, while improving parallelism for shallow FHE workloads by assigning one shallow workload per affiliation and dynamically decomposing the bootstrappable cluster into multiple swift pipelines to accelerate the assigned workload.

2501.18749,"For the last three decades a core use of FPGAs has been for processing communication: FPGA-based SmartNICs are in widespread use from the datacenter to IoT. Augmenting switches with FPGAs, however, has been less studied, but has numerous advantages built around the processing being moved from the edge of the network to the center. Communication switches have previously been augmented to process collectives, e.g., IBM BlueGene and Mellanox SHArP, but the support has been limited to a small set of predefined scalar operations and datatypes. Here we present ACiS, a framework and taxonomy for Advanced Computing in the Switch that unifies and expands our previous work in this area. In addition to fixed scalar collectives (Type 1), we propose three more types of in-switch application processing: (Type 2) User-defined operations and types, including data structures; (Type 3) Look-aside operations that have state within the operation and can have loops; and (Type 4) Fused collectives built by fusing multiple existing collectives or collectives with map computations. ACiS is supported in hardware with modular switch extensions including a CGRA architecture. Software support for ACiS includes evaluation and translation of relevant parts of user programs, compilation of user specifications into control flow graphs, and mapping the graphs into switch hardware. The overall goal is the transparent acceleration of HPC applications encapsulated within an MPI implementation."

Such a circuit dynamically modifies the clock frequency of a digital clock for VLSI systems. Our circuit responds within two clock cycles and halves the length of the synchroniser chain compared to the previous design. Further, we introduce a differential sensor based design for masking latches as a replacement for masking flip flops that the design of \cite{DroopJournal} requires, but leaves unspecified. The use of latches instead of threshold-altered flip flops alters the timing properties of our design and thus the proofs of correctness that accompanied their design require modifications which we present here. This design has been successfully implemented on the IHP 130 nm process technology. The results of the experimental measurements will be discussed in a subsequent publication."

Diverging from traditional approaches, our method avoids time-consuming re-training/fine-tuning and specialized hardware access. By leveraging the variance in weight magnitudes within layers, we quantize values within blocks to two different levels, achieving up to a 50% reduction in precision for 8-bit integer weights to 4-bit values across various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with negligible loss in inference accuracy. To demonstrate efficiency gains by utilizing mixed precision, we implement StruM on top of our in-house FlexNN DNN accelerator [1] that supports low and mixed-precision execution. Experimental results depict that the proposed StruM-based hardware architecture achieves a 31-34% reduction in processing element (PE) power consumption and a 10% reduction in area at the accelerator level.

Block Floating Point (BFP) has proven effective in accelerating linear operations, a cornerstone of LLM workloads. However, as sequence lengths grow, nonlinear operations, such as Attention, increasingly become performance bottlenecks due to their quadratic computational complexity. These nonlinear operations are predominantly executed using inefficient floating-point formats, which renders the system challenging to optimize software efficiency and hardware overhead.

2502.00028,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in generating Verilog code from module specifications. To improve the quality of such generated Verilog codes, previous methods require either time-consuming manual inspection or generation of multiple Verilog codes, from which the one with the highest quality is selected with manually designed testbenches. To enhance the generation efficiency while maintaining the quality of the generated codes, we propose VRank, an automatic framework that generates Verilog codes with LLMs. In our framework, multiple code candidates are generated with LLMs by leveraging their probabilistic nature. Afterwards, we group Verilog code candidates into clusters based on identical outputs when tested against the same testbench, which is also generated by LLMs. Clusters are ranked based on the consistency they show on testbench. To determine the best candidate, Chain-of-Thought is further applied to select the best candidate from the top-ranked clusters. By systematically analyzing diverse outputs of generated codes, VRank reduces errors and enhances the overall quality of the generated Verilog code. Experimental results on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark demonstrate a significant 10.5% average increase in functional correctness (passl1) across multiple LLMs, demonstrating VRank's effectiveness in improving the accuracy of automated hardware description language generation for complex design tasks."

The efficient design of the physical register file is critical since its resources, such as the number of read and write ports, have a significant impact on CPU power consumption. Reducing the number of ports to the physical register file is a well-known direction for optimization. For port-count reduction schemes, balancing the trade-off between the scheme's complexity and performance is crucial. In our work, we introduce a high-level analysis method to estimate the complexity of the schemes during microarchitectural design. Moreover, we explore the structure of different port-count reduction schemes and introduce a practical approach to constructing low-complexity read-portcount reduction schemes for the centralized integer physical register file.

In this paper, we propose an efficient accelerator for 2~8-bit precision scaling with serial activation input and parallel weight preloaded. First, we set two loading modes for the weight operands and decompose the weight into the corresponding bitwidths, which extends the weight precision support efficiently. Then, to improve hardware utilization of low-precision operations, we design the architecture that performs bit-serial MAC operation with systolic dataflow, and the partial sums are combined spatially.

2502.01449,"2.5D integration technology is gaining traction as it copes with the exponentially growing design cost of modern integrated circuits. A crucial part of a 2.5D stacked chip is a low-latency and high-throughput inter-chiplet interconnect (ICI). Two major factors affecting the latency and throughput are the topology of links between chiplets and the chiplet placement. In this work, we present PlaceIT, a novel methodology to jointly optimize the ICI topology and the chiplet placement. While state-of-the-art methods optimize the chiplet placement for a predetermined ICI topology, or they select one topology out of a set of candidates, we generate a completely new topology for each placement. Our process of inferring placement-based ICI topologies connects chiplets that are in close proximity to each other, making it particularly attractive for chips with silicon bridges or passive silicon interposers with severely limited link lengths. We provide an open-source implementation of our method that optimizes the placement of homogeneously or heterogeneously shaped chiplets and the ICI topology connecting them for a user-defined mix of four different traffic types. We evaluate our methodology using synthetic traffic and traces, and we compare our results to a 2D mesh baseline. PlaceIT reduces the latency of synthetic L1-to-L2 and L2-to-memory traffic, the two most important types for cache coherency traffic, by up to 28% and 62%, respectively. It also achieve an average packet latency reduction of up to 18% on traffic traces. PlaceIT enables the construction of 2.5D stacked chips with low-latency ICIs."

Devices like wearables and compact sensors are constrained by their limited physical dimensions and energy capacity, making traditional digital function approximation challenging and hardware-demanding. This paper addresses function approximation in FE by proposing a systematic and generic approach using a combination of Analog Building Blocks (ABBs) that perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication, and squaring. These ABBs serve as the foundation for constructing splines, which are then employed in the creation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), improving the approximation. The analog realization of KAN offers a promising alternative to digital solutions, providing significant hardware benefits, particularly in terms of area and power consumption. Our design achieves a 125x reduction in area and a 10.59% power saving compared to a digital spline with 8-bit precision.

2502.01502,"ReRAM-based accelerators exhibit enormous potential to increase computational efficiency for DNN inference tasks, delivering significant performance and energy savings over traditional platforms. By incorporating adaptive scheduling, these accelerators dynamically adjust to DNN requirements, optimizing allocation of constrained hardware resources. However, ReRAM cells have limited endurance cycles due to wear-out from multiple updates for each inference execution, which shortens the lifespan of ReRAM-based accelerators and presents a practical challenge in positioning them as alternatives to conventional platforms like TPUs. Addressing these endurance limitations is essential for making ReRAM-based solutions viable for long-term, high-performance DNN inference. To address the lifespan limitations of ReRAM-based accelerators, we introduce Hamun, an approximate computing method designed to extend the lifespan of ReRAM-based accelerators through a range of optimizations. Hamun incorporates a novel mechanism that detects faulty cell due to wear-out and retires them, avoiding in this way their otherwise adverse impact on DNN accuracy. Moreover, Hamun extends the lifespan of ReRAM-based accelerators by adapting wear-leveling techniques across various abstraction levels of the accelerator and implementing a batch execution scheme to maximize ReRAM cell usage for multiple inferences. On average, evaluated on a set of popular DNNs, Hamun demonstrates an improvement in lifespan of 13.2x over a state-of-the-art baseline. The main contributors to this improvement are the fault handling and batch execution schemes, which provide 4.6x and 2.6x lifespan improvements respectively."

However, these perspectives often overlook the critical interplay between AI-specific load transients and power electronics. This paper addresses that gap by examining how large-scale AI workloads impose unique demands on power conversion chains and, in turn, how the power electronics themselves shape the dynamic behavior of AI-based infrastructure. We illustrate the fundamental constraints imposed by multi-stage power conversion architectures and highlight the key role of final-stage modules in defining realistic power slew rates for GPU clusters. Our analysis shows that traditional designs, optimized for slower-varying or CPU-centric workloads, may not adequately accommodate the rapid load ramps and drops characteristic of AI accelerators. To bridge this gap, we present insights into advanced converter topologies, hierarchical control methods, and energy buffering techniques that collectively enable robust and efficient power delivery.

Optical computing offers a promising alternative due to its parallelism, high computational speed, and low power consumption. However, existing photonic integrated circuits are constrained by large footprints, costly electro-optical interfaces, and complex control mechanisms, limiting the practical scalability of optical neural networks (ONNs). To address these limitations, we introduce a block-circulant photonic tensor core for a structure-compressed optical neural network (StrC-ONN) architecture. The structured compression technique substantially reduces both model complexity and hardware resources without sacrificing the versatility of neural networks, and achieves accuracy comparable to uncompressed models. Additionally, we propose a hardware-aware training framework to compensate for on-chip nonidealities to improve model robustness and accuracy. Experimental validation through image processing and classification tasks demonstrates that our StrC-ONN achieves a reduction in trainable parameters of up to 74.91%,while still maintaining competitive accuracy levels. Performance analyses further indicate that this hardware-software co-design approach is expected to yield a 3.56 times improvement in power efficiency. By reducing both hardware requirements and control complexity across multiple dimensions, this work explores a new pathway toward practical and scalable ONNs, highlighting a promising route to address future computational efficiency challenges."

2502.02065,"The increasing demand for electronics is driving shorter development cycles for application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). To meet these constraints, hardware designers emphasize reusability and modularity of IP blocks, leveraging standard system-on-chip (SoC) architectures with integrated processors and common interconnects. While these architectures reduce design and verification efforts, they also introduce complexity, as verification must encompass both hardware and software execution.To enhance reusability, hardware IP blocks are often described in higher-abstraction-level languages such as Chisel and SystemRDL, relying on compilers to generate Verilog for RTL simulation and implementation. At the system level, SoC modeling and verification leverage C++ and SystemC, underscoring the need for software compilation. Consequently, an effective build system must support both hardware design flows and software compilation, including cross-compilation for C++, C, and assembly.Existing hardware build systems lack sufficient support for software compilation, necessitating the development of a new solution. In response, the Microelectronics section of CERN initiated SoCMake, initially as part of the System-on-Chip Radiation Tolerant Ecosystem (SOCRATES).

2502.02142,"Data movement in memory-intensive workloads, such as deep learning, incurs energy costs that are over three orders of magnitude higher than the cost of computation. Since these workloads involve frequent data transfers between memory and processing units, addressing data movement overheads is crucial for improving performance. Processing-using-memory (PuM) offers an effective solution by enabling in-memory computation, thereby minimizing data transfers. In this paper we propose Lama, a LUT-based PuM architecture designed to efficiently execute SIMD operations by supporting independent column accesses within each mat of a DRAM subarray. Lama exploits DRAM's mat-level parallelism and open-page policy to significantly reduce the number of energy-intensive memory activation (ACT) commands, which are the primary source of overhead in most PuM architectures. Unlike prior PuM solutions, Lama supports up to 8-bit operand precision without decomposing computations, while incurring only a 2.47% area overhead. Our evaluation shows Lama achieves an average performance improvement of 8.5x over state-of-the-art PuM architectures and a 3.8x improvement over CPU, along with energy efficiency gains of 6.9x/8x, respectively, for bulk 8-bit multiplication.We also introduce LamaAccel, an HBM-based PuM accelerator that utilizes Lama to accelerate the inference of attention-based models. LamaAccel employs exponential quantization to optimize product/accumulation in dot-product operations, transforming them into simpler tasks like addition and counting. LamaAccel delivers up to 9.3x/19.2x reduction in energy and 4.8x/9.8x speedup over TPU/GPU, along with up to 5.8x energy reduction and 2.1x speedup over a state-of-the-art PuM baseline."

2502.02764,"The design of analog circuits is a cornerstone of integrated circuit (IC) development, requiring the optimization of complex, interconnected sub-structures such as amplifiers, comparators, and buffers. Traditionally, this process relies heavily on expert human knowledge to refine design objectives by carefully tuning sub-components while accounting for their interdependencies. Existing methods, such as Bayesian Optimization (BO), offer a mathematically driven approach for efficiently navigating large design spaces. However, these methods fall short in two critical areas compared to human expertise: (i) they lack the semantic understanding of the sizing solution space and its direct correlation with design objectives before optimization, and (ii) they fail to reuse knowledge gained from optimizing similar sub-structures across different circuits. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Large Language Model-based Universal Sizing Optimizer (LLM-USO), which introduces a novel method for knowledge representation to encode circuit design knowledge in a structured text format. This representation enables the systematic reuse of optimization insights for circuits with similar sub-structures. LLM-USO employs a hybrid framework that integrates BO with large language models (LLMs) and a learning summary module. This approach serves to: (i) infuse domain-specific knowledge into the BO process and (ii) facilitate knowledge transfer across circuits, mirroring the cognitive strategies of expert designers. Specifically, LLM-USO constructs a knowledge summary mechanism to distill and apply design insights from one circuit to related ones. It also incorporates a knowledge summary critiquing mechanism to ensure the accuracy and quality of the summaries and employs BO-guided suggestion filtering to identify optimal design points efficiently."
2502.03605,"Device sizing is crucial for meeting performance specifications in operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs), and this work proposes an automated sizing framework based on a transformer model. The approach first leverages the driving-point signal flow graph (DP-SFG) to map an OTA circuit and its specifications into transformer-friendly sequential data. A specialized tokenization approach is applied to the sequential data to expedite the training of the transformer on a diverse range of OTA topologies, under multiple specifications. Under specific performance constraints, the trained transformer model is used to accurately predict DP-SFG parameters in the inference phase. The predicted DP-SFG parameters are then translated to transistor sizes using a precomputed look-up table-based approach inspired by the gm/Id methodology. In contrast to previous conventional or machine-learning-based methods, the proposed framework achieves significant improvements in both speed and computational efficiency by reducing the need for expensive SPICE simulations within the optimization loop; instead, almost all SPICE simulations are confined to the one-time training phase. The method is validated on a variety of unseen specifications, and the sizing solution demonstrates over 90% success in meeting specifications with just one SPICE simulation for validation, and 100% success with 3-5 additional SPICE simulations."

To address this limitation, we propose incorporating structured sparsity support into FPGA architectures. We architect 2D systolic in-fabric blocks, named systolic sparse tensor (SST) slices, that support multiple degrees of sparsity to efficiently accelerate a wide variety of DNNs. SSTs support dense operation, 2:4 (50%) and 1:4 (75%) sparsity, as well as a new 1:3 (66.7%) sparsity level to further increase flexibility. When demonstrating on general matrix multiplication (GEMM) accelerators, which are the heart of most current DNN accelerators, our sparse SST-based designs attain up to 5x higher FPGA frequency and 10.9x lower area, compared to traditional FPGAs.

Leveraging the unique computational and memory access patterns of MoE-ViTs, we develop a latency-optimized streaming attention kernel and a resource-efficient reusable linear kernel, effectively balancing performance and resource consumption. To further enhance design efficiency, we propose a two-stage heuristic search algorithm that optimally tunes hardware parameters for various FPGA resource constraints. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) FPGA designs, UbiMoE achieves 1.34x and 3.35x throughput improvements for MoE-ViT on Xilinx ZCU102 and Alveo U280 platforms, respectively, while enhancing energy efficiency by 1.75x and 1.54x.

2502.05798,"Multimodal Transformers are emerging artificial intelligence (AI) models designed to process a mixture of signals from diverse modalities. Digital computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures are considered promising for achieving high efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. However, current digital CIM-based accelerators exhibit inflexibility in microarchitecture, dataflow, and pipeline to effectively accelerate multimodal Transformer. In this paper, we propose StreamDCIM, a tile-based streaming digital CIM accelerator for multimodal Transformers. It overcomes the above challenges with three features: First, we present a tile-based reconfigurable CIM macro microarchitecture with normal and hybrid reconfigurable modes to improve intra-macro CIM utilization. Second, we implement a mixed-stationary cross-forwarding dataflow with tile-based execution decoupling to exploit tile-level computation parallelism. Third, we introduce a ping-pong-like fine-grained compute-rewriting pipeline to overlap high-latency on-chip CIM rewriting. Experimental results show that StreamDCIM outperforms non-streaming and layer-based streaming CIM-based solutions by geomean 2.63$\times$ and 1.28$\times$ on typical multimodal Transformer models."
2502.0585,"This paper presents a unified framework for codifying and automating optimization strategies to efficiently deploy deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained hardware, such as FPGAs, while maintaining high performance, accuracy, and resource efficiency. Deploying DNNs on such platforms involves addressing the significant challenge of balancing performance, resource usage (e.g., DSPs and LUTs), and inference accuracy, which often requires extensive manual effort and domain expertise. Our novel approach addresses two core key issues: (i)~encoding custom optimization strategies and (ii)~enabling cross-stage optimization search. In particular, our proposed framework seamlessly integrates programmatic DNN optimization techniques with high-level synthesis (HLS)-based metaprogramming, leveraging advanced design space exploration (DSE) strategies like Bayesian optimization to automate both top-down and bottom-up design flows. Hence, we reduce the need for manual intervention and domain expertise. In addition, the framework introduces customizable optimization, transformation, and control blocks to enhance DNN accelerator performance and resource efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 92\% DSP and 89\% LUT usage reduction for select networks, while preserving accuracy, along with a 15.6-fold reduction in optimization time compared to grid search. These results highlight the potential for automating the generation of resource-efficient DNN accelerator designs with minimum effort."
2502.06588,"Our goal in this paper is to understand how to maximize energy efficiency when designing standard-ISA processor cores for subthreshold operation. We hence develop a custom subthreshold library and use it to synthesize the open-source RISC-V cores SERV, QERV, PicoRV32, Ibex, Rocket, and two variants of Vex, targeting a supply voltage of 300 mV in a commercial 130 nm process. SERV, QERV, and PicoRV32 are multi-cycle architectures, while Ibex, Vex, and Rocket are pipelined architectures.We find that SERV, QERV, PicoRV32, and Vex are Pareto optimal in one or more of performance, power, and area. The 2-stage Vex (Vex-2) is the most energy efficient core overall, mainly because it uses fewer cycles per instruction than multi-cycle SERV, QERV, and PicoRV32 while retaining similar power consumption. Pipelining increases core area, and we observe that for subthreshold operation, the longer wires of pipelined designs require adding buffers to maintain a cycle time that is low enough to achieve high energy efficiency. These buffers limit the performance gains achievable by deeper pipelining because they result in cycle time no longer scaling proportionally with pipeline stages. The added buffers and the additional area required for pipelining logic however increase power consumption, and Vex-2 therefore provides similar performance and lower power consumption than the 5-stage cores Vex-5 and Rocket. A key contribution of this paper is therefore to demonstrate that limited-depth pipelined RISC-V designs hit the sweet spot in balancing performance and power consumption when optimizing for energy efficiency in subthreshold operation."

2502.07578,"Large Language Model (LLM) inference uses an autoregressive manner to generate one token at a time, which exhibits notably lower operational intensity compared to earlier Machine Learning (ML) models such as encoder-only transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information. Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3$\times$ higher throughput and consumes 2.9$\times$ less energy. CENT enhances the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2$\times$ more tokens per dollar than GPUs."
2502.0782,"In this study, we address the challenge of low-rank model compression in the context of in-memory computing (IMC) architectures. Traditional pruning approaches, while effective in model size reduction, necessitate additional peripheral circuitry to manage complex dataflows and mitigate dislocation issues, leading to increased area and energy overheads. To circumvent these drawbacks, we propose leveraging low-rank compression techniques, which, unlike pruning, streamline the dataflow and seamlessly integrate with IMC architectures. However, low-rank compression presents its own set of challenges, namely i) suboptimal IMC array utilization and ii) compromised accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach i) employing shift and duplicate kernel (SDK) mapping technique, which exploits idle IMC columns for parallel processing, and ii) group low-rank convolution, which mitigates the information imbalance in the decomposed matrices. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves up to 2.5x speedup or +20.9% accuracy boost over existing pruning techniques."
2502.07823,"Embedded Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (eFPGAs) allow for the design of hardware accelerators of edge Machine Learning (ML) applications at a lower power budget compared with traditional FPGA platforms. However, the limited eFPGA logic and memory significantly constrain compute capabilities and model size. As such, ML application deployment on eFPGAs is in direct contrast with the most recent FPGA approaches developing architecture-specific implementations and maximizing throughput over resource frugality. This paper focuses on the opposite side of this trade-off: the proposed eFPGA accelerator focuses on minimizing resource usage and allowing flexibility for on-field recalibration over throughput. This allows for runtime changes in model size, architecture, and input data dimensionality without offline resynthesis. This is made possible through the use of a bitwise compressed inference architecture of the Tsetlin Machine (TM) algorithm. TM compute does not require any multiplication operations, being limited to only bitwise AND, OR, NOT, summations and additions. Additionally, TM model compression allows the entire model to fit within the on-chip block RAM of the eFPGA. The paper uses this accelerator to propose a strategy for runtime model tuning in the field. The proposed approach uses 2.5x fewer Look-up-Tables (LUTs) and 3.38x fewer registers than the current most resource-fugal design and achieves up to 129x energy reduction compared with low-power microcontrollers running the same ML application."

2502.07842,"Compute-in-memory (CIM) is an efficient method for implementing deep neural networks (DNNs) but suffers from substantial overhead from analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), especially as ADC precision increases. Low-precision ADCs can reduce this overhead but introduce partial-sum quantization errors degrading accuracy. Additionally, low-bit weight constraints, imposed by cell limitations and the need for multiple cells for higher-bit weights, present further challenges. While fine-grained partial-sum quantization has been studied to lower ADC resolution effectively, weight granularity, which limits overall partial-sum quantized accuracy, remains underexplored. This work addresses these challenges by aligning weight and partial-sum quantization granularities at the column-wise level. Our method improves accuracy while maintaining dequantization overhead, simplifies training by removing two-stage processes, and ensures robustness to memory cell variations via independent column-wise scale factors. We also propose an open-source CIM-oriented convolution framework to handle fine-grained weights and partial-sums efficiently, incorporating a novel tiling method and group convolution. Experimental results on ResNet-20 (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and ResNet-18 (ImageNet) show accuracy improvements of 0.99%, 2.69%, and 1.01%, respectively, compared to the best-performing related works. Additionally, variation analysis reveals the robustness of our method against memory cell variations. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our quantization scheme in enhancing accuracy and robustness while maintaining hardware efficiency in CIM-based DNN implementations.

2502.08086,"Efficient sampling of satisfying formulas for circuit satisfiability (CircuitSAT), a well-known NP-complete problem, is essential in modern front-end applications for thorough testing and verification of digital circuits. Generating such samples is a hard computational problem due to the inherent complexity of digital circuits, size of the search space, and resource constraints involved in the process. Addressing these challenges has prompted the development of specialized algorithms that heavily rely on heuristics. However, these heuristic-based approaches frequently encounter scalability issues when tasked with sampling from a larger number of solutions, primarily due to their sequential nature. Different from such heuristic algorithms, we propose a novel differentiable sampler for multi-level digital circuits, called {\sc Demotic}, that utilizes gradient descent (GD) to solve the CircuitSAT problem and obtain a wide range of valid and distinct solutions. {\sc Demotic} leverages the circuit structure of the problem instance to learn valid solutions using GD by re-framing the CircuitSAT problem as a supervised multi-output regression task. This differentiable approach allows bit-wise operations to be performed independently on each element of a tensor, enabling parallel execution of learning operations, and accordingly, GPU-accelerated sampling with significant runtime improvements compared to state-of-the-art heuristic samplers. We demonstrate the superior runtime performance of {\sc Demotic} in the sampling task across various CircuitSAT instances from the ISCAS-85 benchmark suite. Specifically, {\sc Demotic} outperforms the state-of-the-art sampler by more than two orders of magnitude in most cases."
2502.08807,"The rise of deep neural networks (DNNs) has driven an increased demand for computing power and memory. Modern DNNs exhibit high data volume variation (HDV) across tasks, which poses challenges for FPGA acceleration: conventional accelerators rely on fixed execution patterns (dataflow or sequential) that can lead to pipeline stalls or necessitate frequent off-chip memory accesses. To address these challenges, we introduce the Inter-Task Auto-Reconfigurable Accelerator (InTAR), a novel accelerator design methodology for HDV applications on FPGAs. InTAR combines the high computational efficiency of sequential execution with the reduced off-chip memory overhead of dataflow execution. It switches execution patterns automatically with a static schedule determined before circuit design based on resource constraints and problem sizes. Unlike previous reconfigurable accelerators, InTAR encodes reconfiguration schedules during circuit design, allowing model-specific optimizations that allocate only the necessary logic and interconnects. Thus, InTAR achieves a high clock frequency with fewer resources and low reconfiguration time. Furthermore, InTAR supports high-level tools such as HLS for fast design generation. We implement a set of multi-task HDV DNN kernels using InTAR. Compared with dataflow and sequential accelerators, InTAR exhibits $\mathbf{1.8\times}$ and $\mathbf{7.1 \times}$ speedups correspondingly. Moreover, we extend InTAR to GPT-2 medium as a more complex example, which is $\mathbf{3.65 \sim 39.14\times}$ faster and a $\mathbf{1.72 \sim 10.44\times}$ more DSP efficient than SoTA accelerators (Allo and DFX) on FPGAs.

2502.09007,"In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), Transformer demonstrates its performance across various applications. The excessive amount of parameters incurs high latency and energy overhead when processed in the von Neumann architecture. Processing-in-memory (PIM) has shown the potential in accelerating data-intensive applications by reducing data movement. While previous works mainly optimize the computational part of PIM to enhance energy efficiency, the importance of memory design, which consumes the most power in PIM, has been rather neglected. In this work, we present RED, an energy optimization framework for eDRAM-based PIM. We first analyze the PIM operations in eDRAM, obtaining two key observations: 1) memory access energy consumption is predominant in PIM, and 2) read bitline (RBL) voltage swing, sense amplifier power, and retention time are in trade-off relations. Leveraging them, we propose a novel reconfigurable eDRAM and retention-aware scheduling that minimizes the runtime energy consumption of the eDRAM macro. The framework pinpoints the optimal operating point by pre-estimating energy consumption across all possible tiling schemes and memory operations. Then, the reconfigurable eDRAM controls the RBL voltage swing at runtime according to the scheduling, optimizing the memory access power. Moreover, RED employs refresh skipping and sense amplifier power gating to mitigate the energy consumption overhead coming from the trade-off relation. Finally, the RED framework achieves up to 3.05x higher energy efficiency than the prior SRAM-based PIM, reducing the energy consumption of eDRAM macro up to 74.88% with reconfigurable eDRAM and optimization schemes, requiring only 3.5% area and 0.77% energy overhead for scheduling."

One promising solution to address these challenges is offloading-based batched inference, which leverages host memory and disk as an extended memory hierarchy for GPUs. While the approach cost-effectively enables LLM inference, its performance is limited by substantial I/O overhead, primarily due to the large key-value (KV) cache sizes, which increase with batch size and LLM context window length.In this paper, we introduce INFerence-INFinity (INF^2), a framework that boosts generative inference throughput using computational storage devices (CSDs). The core of INF^2 is attention-near storage, which offloads memory-intensive self-attention operations to near-storage accelerators, significantly reducing traffic through the system interconnect. We also propose delayed KV cache writeback to hide storage write latency by delaying newly generated KV cache writes until the cache reaches sufficient size in system memory. Additionally, we introduce cooperative X-cache, a technique designed to further trade off the remaining memory capacity for storage bandwidth. Our methods effectively minimize idle time for computation, improving the overall throughput.To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, \thiswork has been implemented on PyTorch and evaluated on a real system.

We bridge this gap, presenting and evaluating new systolic array architectures that efficiently translate the theoretical complexity reductions of Strassen's algorithm directly into hardware resource savings. Furthermore, the architectures are multisystolic array designs that can multiply smaller matrices with higher utilization than single-systolic array designs. The proposed designs implemented on FPGA reduce DSP requirements by a factor of $1.14^r$ for $r$ implemented Strassen recursion levels, and otherwise require overall similar soft logic resources when instantiated to support matrix sizes down to 32x32 and 24x24 at 1-2 levels of Strassen recursion, respectively.

A typical edge device usually only has 4GB of memory capacity and a bandwidth of less than 20GB/s, while a large language model quantized to 4-bit precision with 7B parameters already requires 3.5GB of capacity, and its decoding process is purely bandwidth-bound.

However, matrices in emerging workloads are not always dense, and sparse matrices where the vast majority of values are zeros are becoming more common. Existing matrix extensions and micro-architectures cannot efficiently process highly sparse matrices due to two reasons: (1) wasted work when one or both input values are zero; and (2) incompatibility with sparse matrix formats. This work proposes SparseZipper that minimally modifies existing matrix extensions and systolic-array-based micro-architectures specialized for dense-dense GEMM to accelerate sparse-sparse GEMM operating on highly sparse matrices with unstructured sparsity structures. Our performance evaluation shows SparseZipper achieves 5.98x and 2.61x speedup over a scalar hash-based implementation of SpGEMM and a state-of-the-art vectorized SpGEMM version, respectively. Our component-level area evaluation shows SparseZipper increases the area of a baseline 16x16 systolic array by only 12.7% resulting in an area overhead for an entire system-on-chip of just a few percent."

2502.11745,"RowHammer is a major read disturbance mechanism in DRAM where repeatedly accessing (hammering) a row of DRAM cells (DRAM row) induces bitflips in physically nearby DRAM rows (victim rows). To ensure robust DRAM operation, state-of-the-art mitigation mechanisms restore the charge in potential victim rows (i.e., they perform preventive refresh or charge restoration). With newer DRAM chip generations, these mechanisms perform preventive refresh more aggressively and cause larger performance, energy, or area overheads. Therefore, it is essential to develop a better understanding and in-depth insights into the preventive refresh to secure real DRAM chips at low cost. In this paper, our goal is to mitigate RowHammer at low cost by understanding the impact of reduced preventive refresh latency on RowHammer. To this end, we present the first rigorous experimental study on the interactions between refresh latency and RowHammer characteristics in real DRAM chips. Our experimental characterization using 388 real DDR4 DRAM chips from three major manufacturers demonstrates that a preventive refresh latency can be significantly reduced (by 64%). To investigate the impact of reduced preventive refresh latency on system performance and energy efficiency, we reduce the preventive refresh latency and adjust the aggressiveness of existing RowHammer solutions by developing a new mechanism, Partial Charge Restoration for Aggressive Mitigation (PaCRAM). Our results show that PaCRAM reduces the performance and energy overheads induced by five state-of-the-art RowHammer mitigation mechanisms with small additional area overhead.

In particular, our energy- and area-efficient CIM based accelerator, named HASTILY, aims to accelerate softmax computation, an integral operation in attention, and minimize their high on-chip memory requirements that grows quadratically with input sequence length. Our architecture consists of novel CIM units called unified compute and lookup modules(UCLMs) that integrate both lookup and multiply-accumulate functionality within the same SRAM array, incurring minimal area overhead over standard CIM arrays. Designed in TSMC 65nm, UCLMs can be used to concurrently perform exponential and matrix-vector multiplication operations. Complementing the proposed architecture, HASTILY features a fine-grained pipelining strategy for scheduling both attention and feed-forward layers, to reduce the quadratic dependence on sequence length to linear dependence. Further, for fast softmax computation which involves computing the maxima and sum of exponential values, such operations are parallelized across multiple cores using reduce and gather strategy. We evaluate our proposed architecture using a compiler tailored towards attention computation and a standard cycle-level CIM simulator. Our evaluation shows end-to-end throughput(TOPS) improvement of 4.4x-9.8x and 1.7x-5.9x over Nvidia A40 GPU and baseline CIM hardware, respectively, for BERT models with INT-8 precision. Additionally, it shows gains of 16x-36x in energy-efficiency(TOPS/W) over A40 GPU and similar energy-efficiency as baseline CIM hardware."
2502.1238,"Modern reconfigurable architectures are increasingly favored for resource-constrained edge devices as they balance high performance, energy efficiency, and programmability well. However, their proficiency in handling regular compute patterns constrains their effectiveness in executing irregular workloads, such as sparse linear algebra and graph analytics with unpredictable access patterns and control flow. To address this limitation, we introduce the Nexus Machine, a novel reconfigurable architecture consisting of a PE array designed to efficiently handle irregularity by distributing sparse tensors across the fabric and employing active messages that morph instructions based on dynamic control flow. As the inherent irregularity in workloads can lead to high load imbalance among different Processing Elements (PEs), Nexus Machine deploys and executes instructions en-route on idle PEs at run-time. Thus, unlike traditional reconfigurable architectures with only static instructions within each PE, Nexus Machine brings dynamic control to the idle compute units, mitigating load imbalance and enhancing overall performance. Our experiments demonstrate that Nexus Machine achieves 90% better performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconfigurable architectures, within the same power budget and area. Nexus Machine also achieves 70% higher fabric utilization, in contrast to SOTA architectures."
2502.13075,"Modern DRAM chips are subject to read disturbance errors. State-of-the-art read disturbance mitigations rely on accurate and exhaustive characterization of the read disturbance threshold (RDT) (e.g., the number of aggressor row activations needed to induce the first RowHammer or RowPress bitflip) of every DRAM row (of which there are millions or billions in a modern system) to prevent read disturbance bitflips securely and with low overhead. We experimentally demonstrate for the first time that the RDT of a DRAM row significantly and unpredictably changes over time. We call this new phenomenon variable read disturbance (VRD). Our experiments using 160 DDR4 chips and 4 HBM2 chips from three major manufacturers yield two key observations. First, it is very unlikely that relatively few RDT measurements can accurately identify the RDT of a DRAM row. The minimum RDT of a DRAM row appears after tens of thousands of measurements (e.g., up to 94,467), and the minimum RDT of a DRAM row is 3.5X smaller than the maximum RDT observed for that row. Second, the probability of accurately identifying a row's RDT with a relatively small number of measurements reduces with increasing chip density or smaller technology node size. Our empirical results have implications for the security guarantees of read disturbance mitigation techniques: if the RDT of a DRAM row is not identified accurately, these techniques can easily become insecure. We discuss and evaluate using a guardband for RDT and error-correcting codes for mitigating read disturbance bitflips in the presence of RDTs that change unpredictably over time. We conclude that a >10% guardband for the minimum observed RDT combined with SECDED or Chipkill-like SSC error-correcting codes could prevent read disturbance bitflips at the cost of large read disturbance mitigation performance overheads (e.g., 45% performance loss for an RDT guardband of 50%)."
2502.13873,"Deep Neural Networks are increasingly leveraging sparsity to reduce the scaling up of model parameter size. However, reducing wall-clock time through sparsity and pruning remains challenging due to irregular memory access patterns, leading to frequent cache misses. In this paper, we present NPU Vector Runahead (NVR), a prefetching mechanism tailored for NPUs to address cache miss problems in sparse DNN workloads. Rather than optimising memory patterns with high overhead and poor portability, NVR adapts runahead execution to the unique architecture of NPUs. NVR provides a general micro-architectural solution for sparse DNN workloads without requiring compiler or algorithmic support, operating as a decoupled, speculative, lightweight hardware sub-thread alongside the NPU, with minimal hardware overhead (under 5%). NVR achieves an average 90% reduction in cache misses compared to SOTA prefetching in general-purpose processors, delivering 4x average speedup on sparse workloads versus NPUs without prefetching. Moreover, we investigate the advantages of incorporating a small cache (16KB) into the NPU combined with NVR. Our evaluation shows that expanding this modest cache delivers 5x higher performance benefits than increasing the L2 cache size by the same amount."
2502.13947,"We present a heuristic algorithm designed to solve Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems efficiently. The algorithm, referred to as IC-D2S, leverages a hybrid approach using Ising and classical machines to address very large problem sizes. Considering the practical limitation on the size of the Ising machine(IM), our algorithm partitions the QUBO problem into a collection of QUBO subproblems (called subQUBOs) and utilizes the IM to solve each subQUBO. Our proposed heuristic algorithm uses a set of control parameters to generate the subQUBOs and explore the search space. Also, it utilizes an annealer based on cosine waveform and applies a mutation operator at each step of the search to diversify the solution space and facilitate the process of finding the global minimum of the problem. We have evaluated the effectiveness of our IC-D2S algorithm on three large-sized problem sets and compared its efficiency in finding the (near-)optimal solution with three QUBO solvers. One of the solvers is a software-based algorithm (D2TS), while the other one (D-Wave) employs a similar approach to ours, utilizing both classical and Ising machines. The results demonstrate that for large-sized problems (>= 5000) the proposed algorithm identifies superior solutions. Additionally, for smaller-sized problems (= 2500), IC-D2S efficiently finds the optimal solution in a significantly faster manner."
2502.1422,"Near-Data Processing (NDP) has been a promising architectural paradigm to address the memory wall problem for data-intensive applications. Practical implementation of NDP architectures calls for system support for better programmability, where having virtual memory (VM) is critical. Modern computing systems incorporate a 4-level page table design to support address translation in VM. However, simply adopting an existing 4-level page table in NDP systems causes significant address translation overhead because (1) NDP applications generate a lot of address translations, and (2) the limited L1 cache in NDP systems cannot cover the accesses to page table entries (PTEs). We extensively analyze the 4-level page table design in the NDP scenario and observe that (1) the memory access to page table entries is highly irregular, thus cannot benefit from the L1 cache, and (2) the last two levels of page tables are nearly fully occupied. Based on our observations, we propose NDPage, an efficient page table design tailored for NDP systems. The key mechanisms of NDPage are (1) an L1 cache bypass mechanism for PTEs that not only accelerates the memory accesses of PTEs but also prevents the pollution of PTEs in the cache system, and (2) a flattened page table design that merges the last two levels of page tables, allowing the page table to enjoy the flexibility of a 4KB page while reducing the number of PTE accesses. We evaluate NDPage using a variety of data-intensive workloads. Our evaluation shows that in a single-core NDP system, NDPage improves the end-to-end performance over the state-of-the-art address translation mechanism of 14.3\%; in 4-core and 8-core NDP systems, NDPage enhances the performance of 9.8\% and 30.5\%, respectively."
2502.14787,"Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoding is important to quantum error correction decoding because of its accuracy. However, many believe that it is difficult, if possible at all, to achieve the microsecond latency requirement posed by superconducting qubits. This work presents the first publicly known MWPM decoder, called Micro Blossom, that achieves sub-microsecond decoding latency. Micro Blossom employs a heterogeneous architecture that carefully partitions a state-of-the-art MWPM decoder between software and a programmable accelerator with parallel processing units, one of each vertex/edge of the decoding graph. On a surface code with code distance $d$ and a circuit-level noise model with physical error rate $p$, Micro Blossom's accelerator employs $O(d^3)$ parallel processing units to reduce the worst-case latency from $O(d^{12})$ to $O(d^9)$ and reduce the average latency from $O(p d^3+1)$ to $O(p^2 d^2+1)$ when $p \ll 1$.We report a prototype implementation of Micro Blossom using FPGA. Measured at $d=13$ and $p=0.1\%$, the prototype achieves an average decoding latency of $0.8 \mu s$ at a moderate clock frequency of $62 MHz$. Micro Blossom is the first publicly known hardware-accelerated exact MWPM decoder, and the decoding latency of $0.8 \mu s$ is 8 times shorter than the best latency of MWPM decoder implementations reported in the literature."
2502.1547,"Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for natural language understanding and text generation. An LLM model relies on a time-consuming step called LLM decoding to generate output tokens. Several prior works focus on improving the performance of LLM decoding using parallelism techniques, such as batching and speculative decoding. State-of-the-art LLM decoding has both compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. Some prior works statically identify and map these different kernels to a heterogeneous architecture consisting of both processing-in-memory (PIM) units and computation-centric accelerators. We observe that characteristics of LLM decoding kernels (e.g., whether or not a kernel is memory-bound) can change dynamically due to parameter changes to meet user and/or system demands, making (1) static kernel mapping to PIM units and computation-centric accelerators suboptimal, and (2) one-size-fits-all approach of designing PIM units inefficient due to a large degree of heterogeneity even in memory-bound kernels.In this paper, we aim to accelerate LLM decoding while considering the dynamically changing characteristics of the kernels involved. We propose PAPI (PArallel Decoding with PIM), a PIM-enabled heterogeneous architecture that exploits dynamic scheduling of compute-bound or memory-bound kernels to suitable hardware units. PAPI has two key mechanisms: (1) online kernel characterization to dynamically schedule kernels to the most suitable hardware units at runtime and (2) a PIM-enabled heterogeneous computing system that harmoniously orchestrates both computation-centric processing units and hybrid PIM units with different computing capabilities. Our experimental results on three broadly-used LLMs show that PAPI achieves 1.8$\times$ and 11.1$\times$ speedups over a state-of-the-art heterogeneous LLM accelerator and a state-of-the-art PIM-only LLM accelerator, respectively."

2502.15832,"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for automating hardware description language (HDL) code generation from high-level natural language instructions. While fine-tuning has improved LLMs' performance in hardware design tasks, prior efforts have largely focused on Verilog generation, overlooking the equally critical task of Verilog understanding. Furthermore, existing models suffer from weak alignment between natural language descriptions and Verilog code, hindering the generation of high-quality, synthesizable designs. To address these issues, we present DeepRTL, a unified representation model that excels in both Verilog understanding and generation. Based on CodeT5+, DeepRTL is fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset that aligns Verilog code with rich, multi-level natural language descriptions. We also introduce the first benchmark for Verilog understanding and take the initiative to apply embedding similarity and GPT Score to evaluate the models' understanding capabilities. These metrics capture semantic similarity more accurately than traditional methods like BLEU and ROUGE, which are limited to surface-level n-gram overlaps. By adapting curriculum learning to train DeepRTL, we enable it to significantly outperform GPT-4 in Verilog understanding tasks, while achieving performance on par with OpenAI's o1-preview model in Verilog generation tasks."
2502.15999,"Many recent computational accelerators provide non-standard (e.g., reduced precision) arithmetic operations to enhance performance for floating-point matrix multiplication. Unfortunately, the properties of these accelerators are not widely understood and lack sufficient descriptions of their behavior. This makes it difficult for tool builders beyond the original vendor to target or simulate the hardware correctly, or for algorithm designers to be confident in their code. To address these gaps, prior studies have probed the behavior of these units with manually crafted tests. Such tests are cumbersome to design, and adapting them as the accelerators evolve requires repeated manual effort.We present a formal model for the tensor cores of Nvidia's Volta, Turing, and Ampere GPUs. We identify specific properties -- rounding mode, precision, and accumulation order -- that drive these cores' behavior. We formalize these properties and then use the formalization to automatically generate discriminating inputs that illustrate differences among machines. Our results confirm many of the findings of previous tensor core studies, but also identify subtle disagreements. In particular, Nvidia's machines do not, as previously reported, use round-to-zero for accumulation, and their 5-term accumulator requires 3 extra carry-out bits for full accuracy. Using our formal model, we analyze two existing algorithms that use half-precision tensor cores to accelerate single-precision multiplication with error correction. Our analysis reveals that the newer algorithm, designed to be more accurate than the first, is actually less accurate for certain inputs."

Bancroft introduces novel optimizations for efficient accelerator implementation to reference-based genome compression, including fixed-stride matching using cuckoo hashes and grouped header encoding, incorporated into a familiar interface supporting random accesses. We evaluate a prototype implementation of Bancroft on an affordable Alveo U50 FPGA equipped with 8 GB of HBM. Thanks to the orders of magnitude improvements in performance and resource efficiency of genomic compression, our prototype provides access to TBs of host-side genomic data at memory-class performance, measuring speeds over 30% of the on-device HBM bandwidth, an order of magnitude higher than conventional PCIe-limited architectures.

Bancroft supports memory-class performance to practically infinite data capacity, using a small, fixed amount of HBM, making it an attractive solution to continued future scalability of computational genomics."
2502.16473,"Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently on edge devices is often constrained by limited memory capacity and high power consumption. Low-bit quantization methods, particularly ternary quantization, have demonstrated significant potential in preserving model accuracy while substantially decreasing memory footprint and computational costs. However, existing general-purpose architectures and accelerators have not fully exploited the advantages of low-bit quantization due to insufficient specialized hardware support. We introduce TerEffic, an FPGA-based architecture tailored for ternary-quantized LLM inference. The proposed system offers flexibility through reconfigurable hardware to meet various system requirements. We evaluated two representative configurations: a fully on-chip design that stores all weights within on-chip memories, scaling out using multiple FPGAs, and an HBM-assisted design capable of accommodating larger models on a single FPGA board. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance and energy efficiency improvements. For single-batch inference on a 370 M-parameter model, our fully on-chip architecture achieves 16,300 tokens/second, delivering a throughput 192 times higher than NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano with a power efficiency of 455 tokens/second/W, marking a 19-fold improvement. The HBM-assisted architecture processes 727 tokens/second for a larger 2.7B-parameter model, which is 3 times of the throughput of NVIDIA A100, while consuming only 46W, resulting in a power efficiency of 16 tokens/second/W, an 8-fold improvement over the A100."

2502.16877,"As the importance of Privacy-Preserving Inference of Transformers (PiT) increases, a hybrid protocol that integrates Garbled Circuits (GC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is emerging for its implementation. While this protocol is preferred for its ability to maintain accuracy, it has a severe drawback of excessive latency. To address this, existing protocols primarily focused on reducing HE latency, thus making GC the new latency bottleneck. Furthermore, previous studies only focused on individual computing layers, such as protocol or hardware accelerator, lacking a comprehensive solution at the system level. This paper presents APINT, a full-stack framework designed to reduce PiT's overall latency by addressing the latency problem of GC through both software and hardware solutions. APINT features a novel protocol that reallocates possible GC workloads to alternative methods (i.e., HE or standard matrix operation), substantially decreasing the GC workload. It also suggests GC-friendly circuit generation that reduces the number of AND gates at the most, which is the expensive operator in GC. Furthermore, APINT proposes an innovative netlist scheduling that combines coarse-grained operation mapping and fine-grained scheduling for maximal data reuse and minimal dependency. Finally, APINT's hardware accelerator, combined with its compiler speculation, effectively resolves the memory stall issue. Putting it all together, APINT achieves a remarkable end-to-end reduction in latency, outperforming the existing protocol on CPU platform by 12.2x online and 2.2x offline. Meanwhile, the APINT accelerator not only reduces its latency by 3.3x but also saves energy consumption by 4.6x while operating PiT compared to the state-of-the-art GC accelerator."
2502.16963,"The billion-scale Large Language Models (LLMs) need deployment on expensive server-grade GPUs with large-storage HBMs and abundant computation capability. As LLM-assisted services become popular, achieving cost-effective LLM inference on budget-friendly hardware becomes the trend. Extensive researches relocate LLM parameters from expensive GPUs to host memory. However, the restricted bandwidth between the host and GPU memory limits the inference performance.This work introduces Hermes, a budget-friendly system that leverages the near-data processing (NDP) within commodity DRAM DIMMs to enhance the performance of a single consumer-grade GPU, achieving efficient LLM inference. The inherent activation sparsity in LLMs naturally divides weight parameters into two categories, termed ``hot"" and ``cold"" neurons, respectively. Hot neurons, which consist of only approximately 20\% of all weight parameters, account for 80\% of the total computational load, while cold neurons make up the other 80\% of parameters but are responsible for just 20\% of the computational load. Therefore, we propose a heterogeneous computing strategy: mapping hot neurons to a single computation-efficient GPU, while offloading cold neurons to NDP-DIMMs, which offer large memory size but limited computation capabilities. Meanwhile, the dynamic nature of activation sparsity needs a real-time partition of hot/cold neurons and adaptive remapping of cold neurons across multiple NDP-DIMM modules. Therefore, we introduce a lightweight predictor optimizing real-time neuron partition and adjustment between GPU and NDP-DIMMs. We also utilize a window-based online scheduling mechanism to maintain load balance among NDP-DIMM modules. Hermes facilitates the deployment of LLaMA2-70B on consumer-grade hardware at 13.75 tokens/s and realizes an average 75.24$\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading-based inference system."
2502.17006,"Computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures demonstrate superior performance over traditional architectures. To unleash the potential of CIM accelerators, many compilation methods have been proposed, focusing on application scheduling optimization specific to CIM. However, existing compilation methods often overlook CIM's capability to switch dynamically between compute and memory modes, which is crucial for accommodating the diverse memory and computational needs of real-world deep neural network architectures, especially the emerging large language models. To fill this gap, we introduce CMSwitch, a novel compiler to optimize resource allocation for CIM accelerators with adaptive mode-switching capabilities, thereby enhancing the performance of DNN applications. Specifically, our approach integrates the compute-memory mode switch into the CIM compilation optimization space by introducing a new hardware abstraction attribute. Then, we propose a novel compilation optimization pass that identifies the optimal network segment and the corresponding mode resource allocations using dynamic programming and mixed-integer programming. CMSwitch uses the tailored meta-operator to express the compilation result in a generalized manner. Evaluation results demonstrate that CMSwitch achieves an average speedup of 1.31$\times$ compared to existing SOTA CIM compilation works, highlighting CMSwitch's effectiveness in fully exploiting the potential of CIM processors for a wide range of real-world DNN applications."
2502.17138,"As memory technologies continue to shrink and memory error rates increase, the demand for stronger reliability becomes increasingly critical. Fine-grain memory replication has emerged as an appealing approach to improving memory fault tolerance by augmenting conventional memory protection based on error-correcting codes with an additional layer of redundancy that replicates data across independent failure domains, such as replicating memory pages across different NUMA sockets. This method can tolerate a broad spectrum of memory errors, from individual memory cell failures to more complex memory controller failures. However, applying memory replication without a holistic consideration of the interaction between error-correcting codes and replication can result in redundant duplication and unnecessary storage overhead. We propose Replication-Aware Memory-error Protection (RAMP), a model that helps explore error protection strategies to improve the storage efficiency of memory protection in memory systems that utilize memory replication for performance and availability. We use RAMP to determine a protection strategy that can lower the storage cost of individual replicas while still ensuring robust protection through the collective protection conferred by multiple replicas. Our evaluation shows that a solution derived with RAMP enhances the storage efficiency of a state-of-the-art memory protection mechanism when paired with rack-level replication for disaggregated memory. Specifically, we can reduce the storage cost of memory protection from 27% down to 17.7% with minimal performance overhead."
2502.17398,"Embedded heterogeneous systems-on-chip (SoCs) rely on domain-specific hardware accelerators to improve performance and energy efficiency. In particular, programmable multi-core accelerators feature a cluster of processing elements and tightly coupled scratchpad memories to balance performance, energy efficiency, and flexibility. In embedded systems running a general-purpose OS, accelerators access data via dedicated, physically addressed memory regions. This negatively impacts memory utilization and performance by requiring a copy from the virtual host address to the physical accelerator address space. Input-Output Memory Management Units (IOMMUs) overcome this limitation by allowing devices and hosts to use a shared virtual paged address space. However, resolving IO virtual addresses can be particularly costly on high-latency memory systems as it requires up to three sequential memory accesses on IOTLB miss. In this work, we present a quantitative evaluation of shared virtual addressing in RISC-V heterogeneous embedded systems. We integrate an IOMMU in an open-source heterogeneous RISC-V SoC consisting of a 64-bit host with a 32-bit accelerator cluster. We evaluated the system performance by emulating the design on FPGA and implementing compute kernels from the RajaPERF benchmark suite using heterogeneous OpenMP programming. We measure the transfers and computation time on the host and accelerators for systems with different DRAM access latencies. We first show that IO virtual address translation can account for 4.2% up to 17.6% of the accelerator's runtime for gemm (General Matrix Multiplication) at low and high memory bandwidth. Then, we show that in systems containing a last-level cache, this IO address translation cost falls to 0.4% and 0.7% under the same conditions, making shared virtual addressing and zero-copy offloading suitable for such RISC-V heterogeneous SoCs."

2502.18174,"The increasing demand for energy-efficient solutions has led to the emergence of an approximate computing paradigm that enables power-efficient implementations in various application areas such as image and data processing. The median filter, widely used in image processing and computer vision, is of immense importance in these domains. We propose a systematic design methodology for the design of power-efficient median networks suitable for on-chip or FPGA-based implementations. A search-based design method is used to obtain approximate medians that show the desired trade-offs between accuracy, power consumption and area on chip. A new metric tailored to this problem is proposed to quantify the accuracy of approximate medians. Instead of the simple error rate, our method analyses the rank error. A significant improvement in implementation cost is achieved. For example, compared to the well-optimized high-throughput implementation of the exact 9-input median, a 30\% reduction in area and a 36\% reduction in power consumption was achieved by introducing an error by one position (i.e., allowing the 4th or 6th lowest input to be returned instead of the median)."
2502.18403,"State of art DL models are growing in size and complexity, with many modern models also increasing in heterogeneity of behavior. GPUs are still the dominant platform for DL applications, relying on a bulk-synchronous execution model which has many drawbacks and is ill-suited for the graph structure of DL applications. Many industry and academic works attempt to overcome these by employing vertical fusion but this approach still fails to realize three untapped opportunities: (1) the fact that many resources on the GPU are idle while only one operator executes due to temporal multiplexing of the SM; (2) lower energy from more intelligent on-chip data-movement which lends to higher performance in a power-provisioned environment. (3) inability to exploit hidden or reduction dimensions as a source of parallelism to ease pressure on batch size. This paper explores relatively uncharted territory, answering the following key question: Can modest adjustments to the current GPU architecture enable efficient dataflow execution, thereby circumventing the constraints of vertical fusion without necessitating a clean-slate architecture design. We develop Kitsune -- a set of primitives that enable dataflow execution on GPUs and an end-to-end compiler based on PyTorch Dynamo. Across 5 challenge applications, Kitsune can provide 1.3$\times$-2.3$\times$ and 1.1$\times$-2.4$\times$ performance improvement as well as 41%-98% and 16%-42% off-chip traffic reduction for inference and training, respectively."
2502.18627,"Weight-only quantization has been widely explored in large language models (LLMs) to reduce memory storage and data loading overhead. During deployment on single-instruction-multiple-threads (SIMT) architectures, weights are stored in low-precision integer (INT) format, while activations remain in full-precision floating-point (FP) format to preserve inference accuracy. Although memory footprint and data loading requirements for weight matrices are reduced, computation performance gains remain limited due to the need to convert weights back to FP format through unpacking and dequantization before GEMM operations. In this work, we investigate methods to accelerate GEMM operations involving packed low-precision INT weights and high-precision FP activations, defining this as the hyper-asymmetric GEMM problem. Our approach co-optimizes tile-level packing and dataflow strategies for INT weight matrices. We further design a specialized FP-INT multiplier unit tailored to our packing and dataflow strategies, enabling parallel processing of multiple INT weights. Finally, we integrate the packing, dataflow, and multiplier unit into PacQ, a SIMT microarchitecture designed to efficiently accelerate hyper-asymmetric GEMMs. We show that PacQ can achieve up to 1.99x speedup and 81.4% reduction in EDP compared to weight-only quantized LLM workloads running on conventional SIMT baselines."
2502.18755,"Large language models (LLMs) are one of the most important killer computer applications. The recent algorithmic advancement proposes a fine-grained group-wise quantization for LLMs, which treats a small set (e.g., 64) of values in a tensor as a compression unit. It effectively preserves the model accuracy without retraining, and has become the standard approach to efficiently deploy LLMs. On the other hand, there are works that propose various adaptive data types to better adapt to different distributions and further reduce the required bit length for LLMs. In this work, our detailed analysis unveils a key finding that while different tensors exhibit similar distributions, small groups can have markedly different distributions. As such, the group-level diversity requires a new level of adaptivity for which existing adaptive data types fail to provide.In this paper, we propose MANT, a mathematically adaptive numeric type, featuring a more flexible encoding paradigm with a wider range of data distribution and more efficient decodingcomputation fusion mechanism to address these challenges. Based on MANT, we develop a supporting framework to assign the appropriate data type for each group adaptively. Meanwhile, the dynamically generated Key-Value (KV) caches in LLMs introduce further complexity for real-time quantization. To tackle this, we propose an efficient real-time quantization mechanism. Besides, we implement a specific processing element (PE) to efficiently support MANT and incorporate a real-time quantization unit. By integrating these components into a systolic array, MANT unifies the group-wise weight and KV cache quantization and addresses the associated challenges.

To tackle these multi-dimensional challenges, in this brief, we present a 16nm, reliable, time-predictable heterogeneous SoC with multiple programmable accelerators. Within a 1.2W power envelope, the SoC integrates software-configurable hardware IPs to ensure predictable access to shared resources, such as the on-chip interconnect and memory system, leading to tight upper bounds on execution times of critical applications. To accelerate mixed-precision mission-critical AI, the SoC integrates a reliable multi-core accelerator achieving 304.9 GOPS peak performance at 1.6 TOPS/W energy efficiency. Non-critical, compute-intensive, floating-point workloads are accelerated by a dual-core vector cluster, achieving 121.8 GFLOPS at 1.1 TFLOPS/W and 106.8 GFLOPS/mm2."
2502.18983,"The Von Neumann bottleneck, which relates to the energy cost of moving data from memory to on-chip core and vice versa, is a serious challenge in state-of-the-art AI architectures, like Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNNs) accelerators. Systolic arrays exploit distributed processing elements that exchange data with each other, thus mitigating the memory cost. However, when involved in convolutions, data redundancy must be carefully managed to avoid significant memory access overhead. To overcome this problem, TrIM has been recently proposed. It features a systolic array based on an innovative dataflow, where input feature map (ifmap) activations are locally reused through a triangular movement. However, ifmaps still suffer from memory accesses overhead. This work proposes 3D-TrIM, an upgraded version of TrIM that addresses the memory access overhead through few extra shadow registers. In addition, due to a change in the architectural orientation, the local shift register buffers are now shared between different slices, thus improving area and energy efficiency. An architecture of 576 processing elements is implemented on commercial 22 nm technology and achieves an area efficiency of 4.47 TOPS/mm$^2$ and an energy efficiency of 4.54 TOPS/W. Finally, 3D-TrIM outperforms TrIM by up to $3.37\times$ in terms of operations per memory access considering CNN topologies like VGG-16 and AlexNet."
2502.19114,"Increasing demands for computing power also propel the need for energy-efficient SoC accelerator architectures. One class for such accelerators are so-called processor arrays, which typically integrate a two-dimensional mesh of interconnected processing elements (PEs). Such arrays are specifically designed to accelerate the execution of multidimensional nested loops by exploiting the intrinsic parallelism of such loops. Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) belong to this class of accelerator architectures. In this work, we analyze four toolchains for mapping loop programs onto CGRAs and compare the resulting mappings wrt. performance, i.e., latency. While most toolchains succeed in simpler kernels like general matrix multiplication, some struggle to find valid mappings for more complex loops like a triangular solver. Furthermore, we observe that the considered CGRA mappers generally tend to underutilize the available PEs."
2502.19215,"To keep up with the growing computational requirements of machine learning workloads, many-core accelerators integrate an ever-increasing number of processing elements, putting the efficiency of memory and interconnect subsystems to the test. In this work, we present the design of a multicast-capable AXI crossbar, with the goal of enhancing data movement efficiency in massively parallel machine learning accelerators. We propose a lightweight, yet flexible, multicast implementation, with a modest area and timing overhead (12% and 6% respectively) even on the largest physically-implementable 16-to-16 AXI crossbar. To demonstrate the flexibility and end-to-end benefits of our design, we integrate our extension into an open-source 288-core accelerator. We report tangible performance improvements on a key computational kernel for machine learning workloads, matrix multiplication, measuring a 29% speedup on our reference system."
2502.19233,"The Compute Express Link (CXL) technology facilitates the extension of CPU memory through byte-addressable SerDes links and cascaded switches, creating complex heterogeneous memory systems where CPU access to various endpoints differs in latency and bandwidth. Effective tiered memory management is essential for optimizing system performance in such systems. However, designing an effective memory tiering system for CXL-extended heterogeneous memory faces challenges: 1) Existing evaluation methods, such as NUMA-based emulation and full-system simulations like GEM5, are limited in assessing hardware-based tiered memory management solutions and handling real-world workloads at scale. 2) Previous memory tiering systems struggle to simultaneously achieve high resolution, low overhead, and high flexibility and compatibility.In this study, we first introduce HeteroBox, a configurable emulation platform that leverages real CXL-enabled FPGAs to emulate the performance of various CXL memory architectures. HeteroBox allows one to configure a memory space with multiple regions, each exhibiting distinct CPU-access latency and bandwidth. HeteroBox helps assess the performance of both software-managed and hardware-managed memory tiering systems with high efficiency and fidelity. Based on HeteroBox, we further propose HeteroMem, a hardware-managed memory tiering system that operates on the device side. HeteroMem creates an abstraction layer between the CPU and device memory, effectively monitoring data usage and migrating data to faster memory tiers, thus hiding device-side heterogeneity from the CPU. Evaluations with real-world applications show that HeteroMem delivers high performance while keeping heterogeneous memory management fully transparent to the CPU, achieving a 5.1\% to 16.2\% performance improvement over existing memory tiering solutions."
2502.19662,"Quantization is critical for efficiently deploying large language models (LLMs). Yet conventional methods remain hardware-agnostic, limited to bit-width constraints, and do not account for intrinsic circuit characteristics such as the timing behaviors and energy profiles of Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units. This disconnect from circuit-level behavior limits the ability to exploit available timing margins and energy-saving opportunities, reducing the overall efficiency of deployment on modern accelerators.To address these limitations, we propose HALO, a versatile framework for Hardware-Aware Post-Training Quantization (PTQ). Unlike traditional methods, HALO explicitly incorporates detailed hardware characteristics, including critical-path timing and power consumption, into its quantization approach. HALO strategically selects weights with low critical-path-delays enabling higher operational frequencies and dynamic frequency scaling without disrupting the architecture's dataflow. Remarkably, HALO achieves these improvements with only a few dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) adjustments, ensuring simplicity and practicality in deployment. Additionally, by reducing switching activity within the MAC units, HALO effectively lowers energy consumption. Evaluations on accelerators such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) demonstrate that HALO significantly enhances inference efficiency, achieving average performance improvements of 270% and energy savings of 51% over baseline quantization methods, all with minimal impact on accuracy."
2502.20197,"In computer architecture courses, we usually teach RISC processors using a five-stage pipeline, neglecting alternative organizations. This design choice, rooted in the 1980s technology, may not be optimal today, and it is certainly not the easiest pipeline for education. This paper examines more straightforward pipeline organizations for RISC processors that are suitable for educational purposes and for implementing embedded processors in FPGAs and ASICs. We analyze resource costs and maximum clock frequency of various designs implemented in an FPGA, using clock frequency as a performance proxy. Additionally, we validate these results with ASIC designs synthesized using the open-source SkyWater130 process.Contradictory to common wisdom, a longer pipeline (up to 5 stages) does not necessarily always increase the maximum clock frequency. In two FPGA and one ASIC implementation, we discovered that a four- or five-stage pipeline leads to a slower clock frequency than a three-stage implementation. The reason is that the width of the forwarding multiplexer in the execution stage increases with longer pipelines, which is on the critical path. We also argue that a 3-stage pipeline organization is more adequate for teaching a pipeline organization of a microprocessor."
2502.20415,"Neuromorphic computing is a relatively new discipline of computer science, where the principles of biological brain's computation and memory are used to create a new way of processing information, based on networks of spiking neurons. Those networks can be implemented as both analog and digital implementations, where for the latter, the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are a frequent choice, due to their inherent flexibility, allowing the researchers to easily design hardware neuromorphic architecture (NMAs). Moreover, digital NMAs show good promise in simulating various spiking neural networks because of their inherent accuracy and resilience to noise, as opposed to analog implementations. This paper presents an overview of digital NMAs implemented on FPGAs, with a goal of providing useful references to various architectural design choices to the researchers interested in digital neuromorphic systems. We present a taxonomy of NMAs that highlights groups of distinct architectural features, their advantages and disadvantages and identify trends and predictions for the future of those architectures."
2502.20775,"Arising disruptive memory technologies continuously make their way into the memory hierarchy at various levels. Racetrack memory is one promising candidate for future memory due to the overall low energy consumption, access latency and high endurance. However, the access dependent shift property of racetrack memory can make it easily a poor candidate, when the number of shifts is not properly reduced. Therefore, we explore how a register file can be constructed by using non-volatile racetrack memories with a properly reduced number of shifts. Our proposed architecture allows allocating registers in a horizontal or vertical allocation mode, where registers are either scattered across nanotracks or allocated along tracks. In this paper, we propose a dynamic approach, where the allocation can be altered at any access between horizontal and vertical. Control flow graph based static program analysis with simulation-based branch probabilities supplies crucially important recommendations for the dynamic allocation, which are applied at runtime. Experimental evaluation, including a custom gem5 simulation setup, reveals the need for this type of runtime reconfiguration.While the performance in terms of energy consumption, for instance, can be comparably high as SRAM when no runtime reconfiguration is done, the dynamic approach reduces it by up to $\approx 6\times$."
2502.20965,"In the last decade, specific-purpose computing and storage devices, such as GPUs, TPUs, or high-speed storage, have been incorporated into server nodes of Supercomputers and Data centers. The development of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) enabled a much more compact form factor for these devices, thus allowing the interconnection of several of them within a server node, typically using an intra-node interconnection network (e.g., PCIe, NVLink, or Infinity Fabric). These networks allow scaling up the number of specific computing and storage devices per node. Furthermore, the inter-node networks communicate thousands of these devices placed in different server nodes in a Supercomputer or Data Center. Unfortunately, the intra- and inter-node networks may become the system's bottleneck due to the increasing communication demand among accelerators of applications such as generative AI. Although current intra-node network designs alleviate this bottleneck by increasing the bandwidth of the intra-node network, we show in this paper that such a high bandwidth for intra-node communication may hinder the inter-node communication performance when traffic from outside the node arrives at the intra-node devices, resulting in interference with intra-node traffic. To analyze the impact of this interference, we have studied the communication operations of realistic traffic patterns exploiting intra-node communication. We have developed a generic intra- and inter-node simulation model based on OMNeT++ and modeled the mentioned communication operations. We have also performed extensive simulation experiments that confirm that increasing the intra-node network bandwidth and the number of computing devices per node (i.e., accelerators) is counterproductive to the inter-node communication performance."
2502.21027,"In the context of the Horizon Europe project, METASAT, a hardware platform was developed as a prototype of future space systems. The platform is based on a multiprocessor NOEL-V, an established space-grade processor, which is integrated with the SPARROW AI accelerator and connected to a GPU, Vortex. Both processing systems follow the RISC-V specification. This is a novel hardware architecture for the space domain as the use of massive parallel processing units, such as GPUs, is starting to be considered for upcoming space missions due to the increased performance required to future space-related workloads, in particular, related to AI. However, such solutions are only currently adopted for New Space, since their limitations come not only from the hardware, but also from the software, which needs to be qualified before being deployed on an institutional mission. For this reason, the METASAT platform is one of the first endeavors towards enabling the use of high performance hardware in a qualifiable environment for safety critical systems. The software stack is based on baremetal, RTEMS and the XtratuM hypervisor, providing different options for applications of various degrees of criticality."
2502.21196,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently gained attention due to their performance on non-Euclidean data. The use of custom hardware architectures proves particularly beneficial for GNNs due to their irregular memory access patterns, resulting from the sparse structure of graphs. However, existing FPGA accelerators are limited by their double buffering mechanism, which doesn't account for the irregular node distribution in typical graph datasets. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AMPLE} (Accelerated Message Passing Logic Engine), an FPGA accelerator leveraging a new event-driven programming flow. We develop a mixed-arithmetic architecture, enabling GNN inference to be quantized at a node-level granularity. Finally, prefetcher for data and instructions is implemented to optimize off-chip memory access and maximize node parallelism. Evaluation on citation and social media graph datasets ranging from $2$K to $700$K nodes showed a mean speedup of $243\times$ and $7.2\times$ against CPU and GPU counterparts, respectively."
2502.21226,"In this work, we introduce a novel GPU-accelerated circuit satisfiability (CircuitSAT) sampling technique for sequential circuits. This work is motivated by the requirement in constrained random verification (CRV) to generate input stimuli to validate the functionality of digital hardware circuits. A major challenge in CRV is generating inputs for sequential circuits, along with the appropriate number of clock cycles required to meet design constraints. Traditional approaches often use Boolean satisfiability (SAT) samplers to generate inputs by unrolling state transitions over a fixed number of clock cycles. However, these methods do not guarantee that a solution exists for the given number of cycles. Consequently, producing input stimuli together with the required clock cycles is essential for thorough testing and verification. Our approach converts the logical constraints and temporal behavior of sequential circuits into a recurrent CircuitSAT problem, optimized via gradient descent to efficiently explore a diverse set of valid solutions, including their associated number of clock cycles. By operating directly on the circuit structure, our method reinterprets the sampling process as a supervised multi-output regression task. This differentiable framework enables independent element-wise operations on each tensor element, facilitating parallel execution during learning. As a result, we achieve GPU-accelerated sampling with substantial runtime improvements (up to 105.1x) over state-of-the-art heuristic samplers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive evaluations on circuit problems from the ISCAS-89 and ITC'99 benchmark suites."
2502.21259,"Processing-in-memory (PIM) is a promising computing paradigm to tackle the ""memory wall"" challenge. However, PIM system-level benefits over traditional von Neumann architecture can be reduced when the memory array cannot fully store all the neural network (NN) weights. The NN size is increasing while the PIM design size cannot scale up accordingly due to area constraints. Therefore, this work targets the system performance optimization and exploration for compact PIM designs. We first analyze the impact of data movement on compact designs. Then, we propose a novel pipeline method that maximizes the reuse of NN weights to improve the throughput and energy efficiency of inference in compact chips. To further boost throughput, we introduce a scheduling algorithm to mitigate the pipeline bubble problem. Moreover, we investigate the trade-off between the network size and system performance for a compact PIM chip. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves 2.35x and 0.5% improvement in throughput and energy efficiency, respectively. Compared to the area-unlimited design, our compact chip achieves approximately 56.5% of the throughput and 58.6% of the energy efficiency while using only one-third of the chip area, along with 1.3x improvement in area efficiency. Our compact design also outperforms the modern GPU with 4.56x higher throughput and 157x better energy efficiency. Besides, our compact design uses less than 20% of the system energy for data movement as batch size scales up."

In this work, we present a TPU architecture that integrates digital CIM to replace conventional digital systolic arrays in matrix multiply units (MXUs). We first establish a CIM-based TPU architecture model and simulator to evaluate the benefits of CIM for diverse generative model inference. Building upon the observed design insights, we further explore various CIM-based TPU architectural design choices. Up to 44.2% and 33.8% performance improvement for large language model and diffusion transformer inference, and 27.3x reduction in MXU energy consumption can be achieved with different design choices, compared to the baseline TPUv4i architecture."

It also exhibits higher data efficiency making it promising for edge deployments. Despite the algorithmic promises and demonstrations, unfortunately executing neurosymbolic workloads on current hardware (CPU/GPU/TPU) is challenging due to higher memory intensity, greater compute heterogeneity and access pattern irregularity, leading to severe hardware underutilization.This work proposes CogSys, a characterization and co-design framework dedicated to neurosymbolic AI system acceleration, aiming to win both reasoning efficiency and scalability. On the algorithm side, CogSys proposes an efficient factorization technique to alleviate compute and memory overhead. On the hardware side, CogSys proposes a scalable neurosymbolic architecture with reconfigurable neuro/symbolic processing elements (nsPE) and bubble streaming (BS) dataflow with spatial-temporal (ST) mapping for highly parallel and efficient neurosymbolic computation. On the system side, CogSys features an adaptive workload-aware scheduler (adSCH) to orchestrate heterogeneous kernels and enhance resource utilization. Evaluated across cognitive workloads, CogSys enables reconfigurable support for neural and symbolic kernels and exhibits >75x speedup over TPU-like systolic array with only <5% area overhead, as benchmarked under the TSMC 28nm technology node. CogSys achieves 4x-96x speedup compared to desktop and edge GPUs.

2503.01281,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for processing graph-structured data, increasingly used for large-scale real-world graphs via sampling-based inference methods. However, inherent characteristics of neighbor sampling lead to redundant data loading during GNN inference, compounded by inefficient data transfers between host and GPU memory, resulting in slow inference and low resource utilization. Existing methods to accelerate GNN inference face several challenges: (1) low practical GPU memory utilization, (2) overlooking adjacency matrix locality, and (3) long preprocessing time. To address these challenges, we introduce DCI, an efficient workload-aware dual-cache allocation system for GNN inference acceleration. DCI allocates cache capacities for both node features and adjacency matrices based on workload patterns during the pre-sampling phase, leveraging a lightweight cache-filling algorithm to optimize data loading efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that DCI accelerates sampling and node feature loading, achieving end-to-end inference speedups of 1.18$\times$ to 11.26$\times$ compared to DGL, and 1.14$\times$ to 13.68$\times$ over RAIN, while reducing preprocessing time by 52.8\% to 98.7\%. Additionally, DCI outperforms state-of-the-art single-cache inference systems by achieving speedup of 1.08$\times$ to 1.32$\times$. We also compared DCI with DUCATI's dual-cache population strategy. Our lightweight population algorithm allows DCI to achieve nearly the same inference speed while keeping preprocessing time to less than 20\% of that required by DUCATI."
2503.01561,"Brain-inspired algorithms are attractive and emerging alternatives to classical deep learning methods for use in various machine learning applications. Brain-inspired systems can feature local learning rules, both unsupervised/semi-supervised learning and different types of plasticity (structural/synaptic), allowing them to potentially be faster and more energy-efficient than traditional machine learning alternatives. Among the more salient brain-inspired algorithms are Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Networks (BCPNNs). BCPNN is an important tool for both machine learning and computational neuroscience research, and recent work shows that BCPNN can reach state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as learning and memory recall compared to other models. Unfortunately, BCPNN is primarily executed on slow general-purpose processors (CPUs) or power-hungry graphics processing units (GPUs), reducing the applicability of using BCPNN in (among others) Edge systems. In this work, we design a custom stream-based accelerator for BCPNN using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) using Xilinx Vitis High-Level Synthesis (HLS) flow. Furthermore, we model our accelerator's performance using first principles, and we empirically show that our proposed accelerator is between 1.3x - 5.3x faster than an Nvidia A100 GPU while at the same time consuming between 2.62x - 3.19x less power and 5.8x - 16.5x less energy without any degradation in performance."
2503.02608,"Error-tolerant applications, such as multimedia processing, machine learning, signal processing, and scientific computing, can produce satisfactory outputs even when approximate computations are performed. Approximate computing (AxC) is nowadays a well-established design and computing paradigm that produces more efficient computation systems by judiciously reducing their computation quality. AxC has been applied to arithmetic circuits, modifying their logic behavior. Depending on the approximation process, arithmetic properties, such as commutativity, are not consistently maintained. When such properties are absent, error accumulation and application outputs depend on the order in which data is processed. In this work, we show that controlling the operand order in non-commutative approximate circuits can greatly reduce computational errors. We propose SWAPPER, a lightweight approach that drastically reduces the approximation error by dynamically changing the order of the input operands using only a single bit for the decision. To explore and identify the most suitable bit for the swapping choice, we propose a framework that can be applied at different granularities, leading to large error reductions and significant accuracy improvements. Experimental results at both component and application levels show error reductions of up to 50% for Mean Absolute Error at the component level and more than 90% at the application level on the AxBench application suite."
2503.03379,"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly efficient due to their spike-based activation, which inherently produces bit-sparse computation patterns. Existing hardware implementations of SNNs leverage this sparsity pattern to avoid wasteful zero-value computations, yet this approach fails to fully capitalize on the potential efficiency of SNNs. This study introduces a novel sparsity paradigm called Product Sparsity, which leverages combinatorial similarities within matrix multiplication operations to reuse the inner product result and reduce redundant computations. Product Sparsity significantly enhances sparsity in SNNs without compromising the original computation results compared to traditional bit sparsity methods. For instance, in the SpikeBERT SNN model, Product Sparsity achieves a density of only $1.23\%$ and reduces computation by $11\times$, compared to bit sparsity, which has a density of $13.19\%$. To efficiently implement Product Sparsity, we propose Prosperity, an architecture that addresses the challenges of identifying and eliminating redundant computations in real-time. Compared to prior SNN accelerator PTB and the A100 GPU, Prosperity achieves an average speedup of $7.4\times$ and $1.8\times$, respectively, along with energy efficiency improvements of $8.0\times$ and $193\times$, respectively.

2503.04253,"The growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains has driven the demand for efficient and scalable AI-serving solutions. Deploying LLMs requires optimizations to manage their significant computational and data demands. The prefill stage processes large numbers of input tokens in parallel, increasing computational load, while the decoding stage relies heavily on memory bandwidth due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs. Current hardware, such as GPUs, often fails to balance these demands, leading to inefficient utilization. While batching improves hardware efficiency, it delays response times, degrading Quality-of-Service (QoS). This disconnect between vendors, who aim to maximize resource efficiency, and users, who prioritize low latency, highlights the need for a better solution. To address this, we propose ADOR, a framework that automatically identifies and recommends hardware architectures tailored to LLM serving. By leveraging predefined architecture templates specialized for heterogeneous dataflows, ADOR optimally balances throughput and latency. It efficiently explores design spaces to suggest architectures that meet the requirements of both vendors and users. ADOR demonstrates substantial performance improvements, achieving 2.51x higher QoS and 4.01x better area efficiency compared to the A100 at high batch sizes, making it a robust solution for scalable and cost-effective LLM serving."

We make a case for persistent CXL switch to persist updates as soon as they reach the switch and hence significantly reduce latency of persisting data. To enable this, we presented a system independent persistent buffer (PB) design that ensures data persistency at CXL switch. Our PB design provides 12\% speedup, on average, over volatile CXL switch.

2503.05116,"Graph processing requires irregular, fine-grained random access patterns incompatible with contemporary off-chip memory architecture, leading to inefficient data access. This inefficiency makes graph processing an extremely memory-bound application. Because of this, existing graph processing accelerators typically employ a graph tiling-based or processing-in-memory (PIM) approach to relieve the memory bottleneck. In the tiling-based approach, a graph is split into chunks that fit within the on-chip cache to maximize data reuse. In the PIM approach, arithmetic units are placed within memory to perform operations such as reduction or atomic addition. However, both approaches have several limitations, especially when implemented on current memory standards (i.e., DDR). Because the access granularity provided by DDR is much larger than that of the graph vertex property data, much of the bandwidth and cache capacity are wasted. PIM is meant to alleviate such issues, but it is difficult to use in conjunction with the tiling-based approach, resulting in a significant disadvantage. Furthermore, placing arithmetic units inside a memory chip is expensive, thereby supporting multiple types of operation is thought to be impractical. To address the above limitations, we present Piccolo, an end-to-end efficient graph processing accelerator with fine-grained in-memory random scatter-gather. Instead of placing expensive arithmetic units in off-chip memory, Piccolo focuses on reducing the off-chip traffic with non-arithmetic function-in-memory of random scatter-gather. To fully benefit from in-memory scatter-gather, Piccolo redesigns the cache and MHA of the accelerator such that it can enjoy both the advantage of tiling and in-memory operations. Piccolo achieves a maximum speedup of 3.28$\times$ and a geometric mean speedup of 1.62$\times$ across various and extensive benchmarks."

We further propose StreamGrid, a framework that integrates these techniques and automatically optimizes on-chip buffer sizes. Our evaluation shows StreamGrid reduces on-chip memory by 61.3\% and energy consumption by 40.5\% with marginal accuracy loss compared to the baselines without our techniques.

However, utilizing simultaneous multithreading (SMT) to scale the number of network threads with the number of application threads suffers from (1) failing to provide strict tail latency requirements for latency-critical applications, and (2) reducing the number of available hardware threads for application processes, thus contributing to a high datacenter network tax. In this work, we design, implement, and evaluate a chip-multiprocessor (CMP) with specialized Simultaneous Data-delivery Threads (SDT) per physical core. The key insight is that with judicious partitioning at the architectural level, SDT can safely co-run with application processes with guaranteed performance isolation. Our evaluation results, using full-system simulation, show that a 20-core CMP enhanced with SDT reduces the area and power consumption of a baseline 40-core CMP by 47.5% and 66%, respectively, while reducing network throughput by less than 10%."

Nevertheless, designing optimal TPU remains challenging due to the high domain expertise level, considerable manual design time, and lack of high-quality, domain-specific datasets. This paper introduces TPU-Gen, the first Large Language Model (LLM) based framework designed to automate the exact and approximate TPU generation process, focusing on systolic array architectures. TPU-Gen is supported with a meticulously curated, comprehensive, and open-source dataset that covers a wide range of spatial array designs and approximate multiply-and-accumulate units, enabling design reuse, adaptation, and customization for different DNN workloads.

2503.06342,"General matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) is a cornerstone of AI computations, making tensor processing engines (TPEs) increasingly critical in GPUs and domain-specific architectures. Existing architectures primarily optimize dataflow or operand reuse strategies. However, considering the interaction between matrix multiplication and multiply-accumulators (MACs) offers greater optimization potential. This work introduces a novel hardware perspective on matrix multiplication, focusing on the bit-weight dimension of MACs. We propose a finer-grained TPE notation using matrix triple loops as an example, introducing new methods for designing and optimizing PE microarchitectures. Based on this notation and its transformations, we propose four optimization techniques that improve timing, area, and power consumption. Implementing our design in RTL using the SMIC-28nm process, we evaluate its effectiveness across four classic TPE architectures: systolic array, 3D-Cube, multiplier-adder tree, and 2D-Matrix. Our techniques achieve area efficiency improvements of 1.27x, 1.28x, 1.56x, and 1.44x, and energy efficiency gains of 1.04x, 1.56x, 1.49x, and 1.20x, respectively.

However, it necessitates FP-INT operations, which make implementation on general-purpose hardware like GPUs difficult. In this paper, we propose FIGLUT, an efficient look-up table (LUT)-based GEMM accelerator architecture. Instead of performing traditional arithmetic operations, FIGLUT retrieves precomputed values from an LUT based on weight patterns, significantly reducing the computational complexity. We also introduce a novel LUT design that addresses the limitations of conventional memory architectures. To further improve LUT-based operations, we propose a half-size LUT combined with a dedicated decoding and multiplexing unit. FIGLUT efficiently supports different bit precisions and quantization methods using a single fixed hardware configuration. For the same 3-bit weight precision, FIGLUT demonstrates 59% higher TOPS/W and 20% lower perplexity than state-of-the-art accelerator designs.

It is widely recognized that several effective metrics exist to capture the efficiency of hardware and/or software hosted in these infrastructures. Unfortunately, choosing the corresponding metrics for specific infrastructure and assessing its efficiency over time is still considered an open problem. For this purpose, energy efficiency metrics, such as the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), assess the efficiency of the computing equipment of the infrastructure. However, this metric stops at the power supply of hosted servers and fails to offer a finer granularity to bring a deeper insight into the Power Usage Effectiveness of hardware and software running in cloudthis http URL, we propose to leverage complementary PUE metrics, coined xPUE, to compute the energy efficiency of the computing continuum from hardware components, up to the running software layers.

2503.07242,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) serve various applications with diverse performance and resource requirements. Model-aware CNN accelerators best address these diverse requirements. These accelerators usually combine multiple dedicated Compute Engines (CEs). The flexibility of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) enables the design of such multiple Compute-Engine (multiple-CE) accelerators. However, existing multiple-CE accelerators differ in how they arrange their CEs and distribute the FPGA resources and CNN operators among the CEs. The design space of multiple-CE accelerators comprises numerous such arrangements, which makes a systematic identification of the best ones an open challenge. This paper proposes a multiple-CE accelerator analytical Cost Model (MCCM) and an evaluation methodology built around MCCM. The model and methodology streamline the expression of any multiple-CE accelerator and provide a fast evaluation of its performance and efficiency. MCCM is in the order of 100000x faster than traditional synthesis-based evaluation and has an average accuracy of > 90%. The paper presents three use cases of MCCM. The first describes an end-to-end evaluation of state-of-the-art multiple-CE accelerators considering various metrics, CNN models, and resource budgets. The second describes fine-grained evaluation that helps identify performance bottlenecks of multiple-CE accelerators. The third demonstrates that MCCM fast evaluation enables exploring the vast design space of multiple-CE accelerators. These use cases show that no unique CE arrangement achieves the best results given different metrics, CNN models, and resource budgets. They also show that fast evaluation enables design space exploration, resulting in accelerator designs that outperform state-of-the-art ones. MCCM is available atthis https URL."
2503.07297,"The rapid advancement of three-dimensional integrated circuits (3DICs) has heightened the need for early-phase design space exploration (DSE) to minimize design iterations and unexpected challenges. Emphasizing the pre-register-transfer level (Pre-RTL) design phase is crucial for reducing trial-and-error costs. However, 3DIC design introduces additional complexities due to thermal constraints and an expanded design space resulting from vertical stacking and various cooling strategies. Despite this need, existing Pre-RTL DSE tools for 3DICs remain scarce, with available solutions often lacking comprehensive design options and full customization support. To bridge this gap, we present Cool-3D, an end-to-end, thermal-aware framework for 3DIC design that integrates mainstream architectural-level simulators, including gem5, McPAT, and HotSpot 7.0, with advanced cooling models. Cool-3D enables broad and fine-grained design space exploration, built-in microfluidic cooling support for thermal analysis, and an extension interface for non-parameterizable customization, allowing designers to model and optimize 3DIC architectures with greater flexibility and accuracy. To validate the Cool-3D framework, we conduct three case studies demonstrating its ability to model various hardware design options and accurately capture thermal behaviors. Cool-3D serves as a foundational framework that not only facilitates comprehensive 3DIC design space exploration but also enables future innovations in 3DIC architecture, cooling strategies, and optimization techniques. The entire framework, along with the experimental data, is in the process of being released on GitHub."
2503.07778,"The future of artificial intelligence (AI) acceleration demands a paradigm shift beyond the limitations of purely electronic or photonic architectures. Photonic analog computing delivers unmatched speed and parallelism but struggles with data movement, robustness, and precision. Electronic processing-in-memory (PIM) enables energy-efficient computing by co-locating storage and computation but suffers from endurance and reconfiguration constraints, limiting it to static weight mapping. Neither approach alone achieves the balance needed for adaptive, efficient AI. To break this impasse, we study a hybrid electronic-photonic-PIM computing architecture and introduce H3PIMAP, a heterogeneity-aware mapping framework that seamlessly orchestrates workloads across electronic and optical tiers. By optimizing workload partitioning through a two-stage multi-objective exploration method, H3PIMAP harnesses light speed for high-throughput operations and PIM efficiency for memory-bound tasks. System-level evaluations on language and vision models show H3PIMAP achieves a 2.74x energy efficiency improvement and a 3.47x latency reduction compared to homogeneous architectures and naive mapping strategies. This proposed framework lays the foundation for hybrid AI accelerators, bridging the gap between electronic and photonic computation for next-generation efficiency and scalability."
2503.08823,"Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely used in modern hardware design, yet writing Hardware Description Language (HDL) code for FPGA implementation remains a complex and time-consuming task. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for HDL generation, but existing benchmarks for LLM-based code generation primarily focus on functional correctness while overlooking hardware resource usage. Furthermore, current benchmarks offer limited diversity and do not fully represent the wide range of real-world FPGA applications. To address these shortcomings, we introduce ResBench, the first resource-focused benchmark explicitly designed to distinguish between resource-optimized and inefficient LLM-generated HDL code. ResBench consists of 56 problems across 12 categories, covering applications from finite state machines to financial computing. Our open-source evaluation framework automatically tests LLMs by generating Verilog code, verifying correctness, and measuring resource usage.

2503.10861,"With the advent of modern multi-chiplet FPGA architectures, vendors have begun integrating hardened NoC to address the scalability, resource usage, and frequency disadvantages of soft NoCs. However, as this work shows, effectively harnessing these hardened NoC is not trivial. It requires detailed knowledge of the microarchitecture and how it relates to the physical design of the FPGA. Existing literature has provided in-depth analyses for NoC in MPSoC devices, but few studies have systematically evaluated hardened NoC in FPGA, which have several unique implications.This work aims to bridge this knowledge gap by demystifying the performance and design trade-offs of hardened NoC on FPGA. Our work performs detailed performance analysis of hard (and soft) NoC under different settings, including diverse NoC topologies, routing strategies, traffic patterns and different external memories under various NoC placements.In the context of Versal FPGAs, our results show that using hardened NoC in multi-SLR designs can reduce expensive cross-SLR link usage by up to 30~40%, eliminate general-purpose logic overhead, and remove most critical paths caused by large on-chip crossbars. However, under certain aggressive traffic patterns, the frequency advantage of hardened NoC is outweighed by the inefficiency in the network microarchitecture. We also observe suboptimal solutions from the NoC compiler and distinct performance variations between the vertical and horizontal interconnects, underscoring the need for careful design. These findings serve as practical guidelines for effectively integrating hardened NoC and highlight important trade-offs for future FPGA-based systems."
2503.1146,"The growing disparity between CPU core counts and available memory bandwidth has intensified memory contention in servers. This particularly affects highly parallelizable applications, which must achieve efficient cache utilization to maintain performance as CPU core counts grow. Optimizing cache utilization, however, is complex for recent chiplet-based CPUs, whose partitioned L3 caches lead to varying latencies and bandwidths, even within a single NUMA domain. Classical NUMA optimizations and task scheduling approaches unfortunately fail to address the performance issues of chiplet-based CPUs.We describe Adaptive Runtime system for Chiplet-Aware Scheduling (ARCAS), a new runtime system designed for chiplet-based CPUs. ARCAS combines chiplet-aware task scheduling heuristics, hardware-aware memory allocation, and fine-grained performance monitoring to optimize workload execution. It implements a lightweight concurrency model that combines user-level thread features-such as individual stacks, per-task scheduling, and state management-with coroutine-like behavior, allowing tasks to suspend and resume execution at defined points while efficiently managing task migration across chiplets. Our evaluation across diverse scenarios shows ARCAS's effectiveness for optimizing the performance of memory-intensive parallel applications."

Existing image retrieval techniques are adept at handling natural images, which converts images into feature vectors and retrieval similar images according to the closeness of these vectors. Nonetheless, these approaches exhibit limitations when applied to the more specialized and intricate domain of circuit diagrams. This paper presents a novel approach to circuit diagram retrieval by employing a graph representation of circuit diagrams, effectively reformulating the retrieval task as a graph retrieval problem. The proposed methodology consists of two principal components: a circuit diagram recognition algorithm designed to extract the circuit components and topological structure of the circuit using proposed GAM-YOLO model and a 2-step connected domain filtering algorithm, and a hierarchical retrieval strategy based on graph similarity and different graph representation methods for analog circuits.

2503.11663,"The computational and memory challenges of large language models (LLMs) have sparked several optimization approaches towards their efficient implementation. While prior LLM-targeted quantization, and prior works on sparse acceleration have significantly mitigated the memory and computation bottleneck, they do so assuming high power platforms such as GPUs and server-class FPGAs with large off-chip memory bandwidths and employ a generalized matrix multiplication (GEMM) execution of all the layers in the decoder. In such a GEMM-based execution, data is fetched from an off-chip memory, computed and stored back. However, at reduced off-chip memory capacities, as is the case with low-power edge devices, this implementation strategy significantly increases the attention computation latency owing to the repeated storage and fetch of large intermediate tokens to and from the off-chip memory. Moreover, fetching the weight matrices from a bandwidth constrained memory further aggravates the memory bottleneck problem. To this end, we introduce MEADOW, a framework that significantly reduces the off-chip memory access for LLMs with a novel token-parallel head-sequential (TPHS) dataflow. Additionally, MEADOW applies weight packing that performs loss-less decomposition of large weight matrices to their unique elements thereby, reducing the enormous weight fetch latency. MEADOW demonstrates 1.5x and 2.5x lower decode and prefill latency, respectively, compared to a GEMM-based LLM implementation on the low power Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA platform that consumes less than 10W. Additionally, MEADOW achieves an end-to-end latency improvement of over 40%, compared to prior LLM optimization works."

As data centers face increasing sustainability demands, such as reduced carbon emissions, efficient management of Flash overprovisioning and endurance has become crucial. Our analysis demonstrates that mixing data with different lifetimes on Flash blocks results in high device garbage collection costs, which either reduce device lifetime or necessitate host overprovisioning. Targeted data placement on Flash to minimize data intermixing and thus device write amplification shows promise for addressing this issue.The NVMe Flexible Data Placement (FDP) proposal is a newly ratified technical proposal aimed at addressing data placement needs while reducing the software engineering costs associated with past storage interfaces, such as ZNS and Open-Channel SSDs. In this study, we explore the feasibility, benefits, and limitations of leveraging NVMe FDP primitives for data placement on Flash media in CacheLib, a popular open-source Flash cache widely deployed and used in Meta's software ecosystem as a caching building block. We demonstrate that targeted data placement in CacheLib using NVMe FDP SSDs helps reduce device write amplification, embodied carbon emissions, and power consumption with almost no overhead to other metrics. Using multiple production traces and their configurations from Meta and Twitter, we show that an ideal device write amplification of ~1 can be achieved with FDP, leading to improved SSD utilization and sustainable Flash cache deployments."

Existing techniques, such as Constrained Random Verification (CRV) and coverage-driven methodologies, rely on time-consuming and redundant simulation regression, leading to higher verification costs and longer time-to-market due to the manual effort required to adjust constraints and drive the stimuli to achieve coverage objectives. To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology that leverages supervised Machine Learning (ML) to optimize simulation regressions, resulting in reduced simulation run-time and the number of test simulations required to achieve target coverage goals. We also investigate and compare the effectiveness of various supervised learning algorithms from scikit-learn. Our results demonstrate that these algorithms can achieve at least 99% coverage regain with significantly reduced simulation cycles. We utilize Python Universal Verification Methodology (PyUVM) over SystemVerilog-Universal Verification Methodology (SV-UVM) for testbench creation, enabling simpler constructs using Python and facilitating the reuse of existing ML libraries.

In this work, we propose a GPU-accelerated timing-driven global placement framework, integrating accurate path-level information into the efficient DREAMPlace infrastructure. It optimizes the fine-grained pin-to-pin attraction objective and is facilitated by efficient critical path extraction. We also design a quadratic distance loss function specifically to align with the RC timing model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the current leading timing-driven placers, achieving an average improvement of 40.5% in total negative slack (TNS) and 8.3% in worst negative slack (WNS), as well as an improvement in half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL)."

2503.13572,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, achieving exceptional results on various established benchmarking frameworks. However, concerns about data contamination - where benchmark data inadvertently leaks into pre-training or fine-tuning datasets - raise questions about the validity of these evaluations. While this issue is known, limiting the industrial adoption of LLM-driven software engineering, hardware coding has received little to no attention regarding these risks. For the first time, we analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) evaluation frameworks for Verilog code generation (VerilogEval and RTLLM), using established methods for contamination detection (CCD and Min-K% Prob). We cover SOTA commercial and open-source LLMs (CodeGen2.5, Minitron 4b, Mistral 7b, phi-4 mini, LLaMA-{1,2,3.1}, GPT-{2,3.5,4o}, Deepseek-Coder, and CodeQwen 1.5), in baseline and fine-tuned models (RTLCoder and Verigen). Our study confirms that data contamination is a critical concern. We explore mitigations and the resulting trade-offs for code quality vs fairness (i.e., reducing contamination toward unbiased benchmarking)."
2503.13848,"Reliability and real-time responsiveness in safety-critical systems have traditionally been achieved using error detection mechanisms, such as LockStep, which require pre-configured checker cores,strict synchronisation between main and checker cores, static error detection regions, or limited preemption capabilities. However, these core-bound hardware mechanisms often lead to significant resource over-provisioning, and diminished real-time responsiveness, particularly in modern systems where tasks with varying reliability requirements are consolidated on shared processors to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and save power. To address these challenges, this work presents FlexStep, a systematic solution that integrates hardware and software across the SoC, ISA, and OS scheduling layers. FlexStep features a novel microarchitecture that supports dynamic core configuration and asynchronous, preemptive error detection. The FlexStep architecture naturally allows for flexible task scheduling and error detection, enabling new scheduling algorithms that enhance both resource efficiency and real-time schedulability. We publicly release FlexStep's source code, atthis https URL."
2503.14067,"Modern microprocessors extend their instruction set architecture (ISA) with Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) operations to improve performance. The Intel Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) enhance the x86 ISA and are widely supported in Intel and AMD processors. The latest version, AVX10.2, places a strong emphasis on low-precision, non-standard floating-point formats, including bfloat16 and E4M3/E5M2 float8 (OCP 8-bit Floating Point, OFP8), primarily catering to deep learning applications rather than general-purpose arithmetic. However, as these formats remain within the IEEE 754 framework, they inherit its limitations, introducing inconsistencies and added complexity into the ISA.This paper examines the recently proposed tapered-precision takum floating-point format, which has been shown to offer significant advantages over IEEE 754 and its derivatives as a general-purpose number format. Using AVX10.2 as a case study, the paper explores the potential benefits of replacing the multitude of floating-point formats with takum as a uniform basis. The results indicate a more consistent instruction set, improving readability and flexibility while offering potential for 8- and 16-bit general-purpose SIMD arithmetic."
2503.14354,"A CORDIC-based configuration for the design of Activation Functions (AF) was previously suggested to accelerate ASIC hardware design for resource-constrained systems by providing functional reconfigurability. Since its introduction, this new approach for neural network acceleration has gained widespread popularity, influencing numerous designs for activation functions in both academic and commercial AI processors. In this retrospective analysis, we explore the foundational aspects of this initiative, summarize key developments over recent years, and introduce the DA-VINCI AF tailored for the evolving needs of AI applications. This new generation of dynamically configurable and precision-adjustable activation function cores promise greater adaptability for a range of activation functions in AI workloads, including Swish, SoftMax, SeLU, and GeLU, utilizing the Shift-and-Add CORDIC technique.

2503.15112,"The automated generation of design RTL based on large language model (LLM) and natural language instructions has demonstrated great potential in agile circuit design. However, the lack of datasets and benchmarks in the public domain prevents the development and fair evaluation of LLM solutions. This paper highlights our latest advances in open datasets and benchmarks from three perspectives: (1) RTLLM 2.0, an updated benchmark assessing LLM's capability in design RTL generation. The benchmark is augmented to 50 hand-crafted designs. Each design provides the design description, test cases, and a correct RTL code. (2) AssertEval, an open-source benchmark assessing the LLM's assertion generation capabilities for RTL verification. The benchmark includes 18 designs, each providing specification, signal definition, and correct RTL code. (3) RTLCoder-Data, an extended open-source dataset with 80K instruction-code data samples. Moreover, we propose a new verification-based method to verify the functionality correctness of training data samples. Based on this technique, we further release a dataset with 7K verified high-quality samples. These three studies are integrated into one framework, providing off-the-shelf support for the development and evaluation of LLMs for RTL code generation and verification. Finally, extensive experiments indicate that LLM performance can be boosted by enlarging the training dataset, improving data quality, and improving the training scheme."
2503.15461,"The deployment of cooperative-intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) has started, and standardization and research activities are moving forward to improve road safety and vehicular efficiency. An aspect that is still felt as a limitation by the research groups active in the field, is the difficulty to validate the solutions with real hardware and software, because of the huge investments that are needed when multiple equipped vehicles need to be considered. In this work, we present a platform with low-cost hardware based on a Raspberry Pi and a Wi-Fi module transmitting at 5.9 GHz, and on the open-source software Open Stack for Car (OScar), which is compliant with the ETSI C-ITS standards. With a limited cost in the order of 200 EUR, the platform realizes a device which is standard compliant and can be used as either on-board unit (OBU) or road side unit (RSU). The limited cost makes the testbed scalable to several units with limited budget and the limited size makes it also deployable on mini-cars to test advanced connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) networks and applications. Our tests demonstrate its interoperability with other devices, compliance in terms of power spectrum, and a range of a few hundred meters in line-of-sight (LOS) conditions using the standard settings of ITS-G5."
2503.15753,"With the increasing prevalence of chiplet systems in high-performance computing applications, the number of design options has increased dramatically. Instead of chips defaulting to a single die design, now there are options for 2.5D and 3D stacking along with a plethora of choices regarding configurations and processes. For chiplet-based designs, high-impact decisions such as those regarding the number of chiplets, the design partitions, the interconnect types, and other factors must be made early in the development process. In this work, we describe an open-source tool, CATCH, that can be used to guide these early design choices. We also present case studies showing some of the insights we can draw by using this tool. We look at case studies on optimal chip size, defect density, test cost, IO types, assembly processes, and substrates."
2503.16109,"The conventional LUT is redundant since practical functions in real-world benchmarks only occupy a small proportion of all the functions. For example, there are only 3881 out of more than $10^{14}$ NPN classes of 6-input functions occurring in the mapped netlists of the VTR8 and Koios benchmarks. Therefore, we propose a novel LUT-like architecture, named DSLUT, with asymmetric inputs and programmable bits to efficiently implement the practical functions in domain-specific benchmarks instead of all the functions. The compact structure of the MUX Tree in the conventional LUT is preserved, while fewer programmable bits are connected to the MUX Tree according to the bit assignment generated by the proposed algorithm. A 6-input DSLUT with 26 SRAM bits is generated for evaluation, which is based on the practical functions of 39 circuits from the VTR8 and Koios benchmarks. After the synthesis flow of ABC, the post-synthesis results show that the proposed DSLUT6 architecture reduces the number of levels by 10.98% at a cost of 7.25% area overhead compared to LUT5 architecture, while LUT6 reduces 15.16% levels at a cost of 51.73% more PLB area. After the full VTR flow, the post-implementation results show that the proposed DSLUT6 can provide performance improvement by 4.59% over LUT5, close to 5.42% of LUT6 over LUT5, causing less area overhead (6.81% of DSLUT6 and 10.93% of LUT6)."
2503.16346,"Quantum graph states are critical resources for various quantum algorithms, and also determine essential interconnections in distributed quantum computing. There are two schemes for generating graph states probabilistic scheme and deterministic scheme. While the all-photonic probabilistic scheme has garnered significant attention, the emitter-photonic deterministic scheme has been proved to be more scalable and feasible across several hardware platforms.This paper studies the GraphState-to-Circuit compilation problem in the context of the deterministic scheme. Previous research has primarily focused on optimizing individual circuit parameters, often neglecting the characteristics of quantum hardware, which results in impractical implementations. Additionally, existing algorithms lack scalability for larger graph sizes. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel compilation framework that partitions the target graph state into subgraphs, compiles them individually, and subsequently combines and schedules the circuits to maximize emitter resource utilization. Furthermore, we incorporate local complementation to transform graph states and minimize entanglement overhead. Evaluation of our framework on various graph types demonstrates significant reductions in CNOT gates and circuit duration, up to 52% and 56%. Moreover, it enhances the suppression of photon loss, achieving improvements of up to x1.9."
2503.16514,"Designing Verilog modules requires meticulous attention to correctness, efficiency, and adherence to design specifications. However, manually writing Verilog code remains a complex and time-consuming task that demands both expert knowledge and iterative refinement. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their structured text generation capabilities, we propose VeriMind, an agentic LLM framework for Verilog code generation that significantly automates and optimizes the synthesis process. Unlike traditional LLM-based code generators, VeriMind employs a structured reasoning approach: given a user-provided prompt describing design requirements, the system first formulates a detailed train of thought before the final Verilog code is generated. This multi-step methodology enhances interpretability, accuracy, and adaptability in hardware design. In addition, we introduce a novel evaluation metric-pass@ARC-which combines the conventional pass@k measure with Average Refinement Cycles (ARC) to capture both success rate and the efficiency of iterative refinement. Experimental results on diverse hardware design tasks demonstrated that our approach achieved up to $8.3\%$ improvement on pass@k metric and $8.1\%$ on pass@ARC metric. These findings underscore the transformative potential of agentic LLMs in automated hardware design, RTL development, and digital system synthesis."
2503.16731,"Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on intensive matrix multiplications for attention and feed-forward layers, with the Q, K, and V linear projections in the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHA) module constituting a decisive performance bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a highly optimized tiled matrix multiplication accelerator on a resource-constrained Xilinx KV260 FPGA that not only addresses this challenge but sets a new standard for efficiency and performance. Our design exploits persistent on-chip storage, a robust two-level tiling strategy for maximal data reuse, and a systolic-like unrolled compute engine that together deliver unparalleled speed and energy efficiency. Integrated with DistilBERT for Q, K, and V projections, our accelerator achieves an unequivocal 7x speedup over ARM CPU implementations (PyTorch) and an extraordinary 200x improvement over naive NumPy, reaching a throughput of up to 3.1~GFLOPs for matrix multiplications on (64,768) x (768,3072) matrices while operating at a conservative 100 MHz. These results decisively demonstrate the transformative potential of FPGA-based acceleration for critical Transformer operations, paving the way for scalable and energy-efficient deep learning inference on edge devices."
2503.16749,"Modern DRAM is vulnerable to read disturbance (e.g., RowHammer and RowPress) that significantly undermines the robust operation of the system. Repeatedly opening and closing a DRAM row (RowHammer) or keeping a DRAM row open for a long period of time (RowPress) induces bitflips in nearby unaccessed DRAM rows. Prior works on DRAM read disturbance either 1) perform experimental characterization using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) DRAM chips to demonstrate the high-level characteristics of the read disturbance bitflips, or 2) perform device-level simulations to understand the low-level error mechanisms of the read disturbance bitflips.In this paper, we attempt to align and cross-validate the real-chip experimental characterization results and state-of-the-art device-level studies of DRAM read disturbance. To do so, we first identify and extract the key bitflip characteristics of RowHammer and RowPress from the device-level error mechanisms studied in prior works. Then, we perform experimental characterization on 96 COTS DDR4 DRAM chips that directly match the data and access patterns studied in the device-level works. Through our experiments, we identify fundamental inconsistencies in the RowHammer and RowPress bitflip directions and access pattern dependence between experimental characterization results and the device-level error mechanisms.Based on our results, we hypothesize that either 1) the retention failure based DRAM architecture reverse-engineering methodologies do not fully work on modern DDR4 DRAM chips, or 2) existing device-level works do not fully uncover all the major read disturbance error mechanisms. We hope our findings inspire and enable future works to build a more fundamental and comprehensive understanding of DRAM read disturbance."
2503.17333,"The deployment of Machine Learning (ML) applications at the edge on resource-constrained devices has accentuated the need for efficient ML processing on low-cost processors. While traditional CPUs provide programming flexibility, their general-purpose architecture often lacks the throughput required for complex ML models. The augmentation of a RISC-V processor with a vector unit can provide substantial data-level parallelism. However, increasing the data-level parallelism supported by vector processing would make the Vector Register File (VRF) a major area consumer in ultra low-cost processors, since 32 vector registers are required for RISC-V Vector ISA compliance. This work leverages the insight that many ML vectorized kernels require a small number of active vector registers, and proposes the use of a physically smaller VRF that dynamically caches only the vector registers currently accessed by the application. This approach, called Register Dispersion, maps the architectural vector registers to a smaller set of physical registers. The proposed ISA-compliant VRF is significantly smaller than a full-size VRF and operates like a conventional cache, i.e., it only stores the most recently accessed vector registers. Essential registers remain readily accessible within the compact VRF, while the others are offloaded to the cache/memory sub-system. The compact VRF design is demonstrated to yield substantial area and power savings, as compared to using a full VRF, with no or minimal impact on performance. This effective trade-off renders the inclusion of vector units in low-cost processors feasible and practical."
2503.17602,"Modern day applications have grown in size and require more computational power. The rise of machine learning and AI increased the need for parallel computation, which has increased the need for GPGPUs. With the increasing demand for computational power, GPGPUs' SIMT architecture has solved this with an increase in the number of threads and the number of cores in a GPU, increasing the throughput of these processors to match the demand of the applications. However, this created a larger demand for the memory, making the memory bandwidth a bottleneck. The introduction of High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) with its increased number of memory ports offers a potential solution for the GPU to exploit its memory parallelism to increase the memory bandwidth. However, effectively leveraging HBM's memory parallelism to maximize bandwidth presents a unique and complex challenge for GPU architectures on how to distribute those ports among the streaming multiprocessors in the GPGPU. In this work, we extend the Vortex OpenGPU microarchitecture to incorporate a multiport memory hierarchy, spanning from the L1 cache to the last-level cache (LLC). In addition, we propose various arbitration strategies to optimize memory transfers across the cache hierarchy. The results have shown that an increase in memory ports increases IPC, achieving an average speedup of 2.34x with 8 memory ports in the tested configuration while showing relatively small area overhead."
2503.17864,"Memory disaggregation is an emerging technology that decouples memory from traditional memory buses, enabling independent scaling of compute and memory. Compute Express Link (CXL), an open-standard interconnect technology, facilitates memory disaggregation by allowing processors to access remote memory through the PCIe bus while preserving the shared-memory programming model. This innovation creates a tiered memory architecture combining local DDR and remote CXL memory with distinct performance characteristics.In this paper, we investigate the architectural implications of CXL memory, focusing on its increased latency and performance heterogeneity, which can undermine the efficiency of existing processor designs optimized for (relatively) uniform memory latency. Using carefully designed micro-benchmarks, we identify bottlenecks such as limited hardware-level parallelism in CXL memory, unfair queuing in memory request handling, and its impact on DDR memory performance and inter-core synchronization. Our findings reveal that the disparity in memory tier parallelism can reduce DDR memory bandwidth by up to 81% under heavy loads. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Memory Request Control mechanism, MIKU, that prioritizes DDR memory requests while serving CXL memory requests on a best-effort basis. By dynamically adjusting CXL request rates based on service time estimates, MIKU achieves near-peak DDR throughput while maintaining high performance for CXL memory. Our evaluation with micro-benchmarks and representative workloads demonstrates the potential of MIKU to enhance tiered memory system efficiency."
2503.17959,"Training on edge devices enables personalized model fine-tuning to enhance real-world performance and maintain data privacy. However, the gradient computation for backpropagation in the training requires significant memory buffers to store intermediate features and compute losses. This is unacceptable for memory-constrained edge devices such as microcontrollers. To tackle this issue, we propose a training acceleration method using dynamic gradient sparse updates. This method updates the important channels and layers only and skips gradient computation for the less important channels and layers to reduce memory usage for each update iteration. In addition, the channel selection is dynamic for different iterations to traverse most of the parameters in the update layers along the time dimension for better performance. The experimental result shows that the proposed method enables an ImageNet pre-trained MobileNetV2 trained on CIFAR-10 to achieve an accuracy of 85.77\% while updating only 2\% of convolution weights within 256KB on-chip memory. This results in a remarkable 98\% reduction in feature memory usage compared to dense model training."

2503.18599,"Modern Large Language Model serving system batches multiple requests to achieve high throughput, while batching attention operations is challenging, rendering memory bandwidth a critical bottleneck. The community relies on high-end GPUs with multiple high-bandwidth memory channels. Unfortunately, HBM's high bandwidth often comes at the expense of limited memory capacity, which reduces core utilization and increases costs. Recent advancements enabling longer contexts for LLMs have substantially increased the key-value cache size, further intensifying the pressures on memory capacity. The literature has explored KV cache quantization techniques, which commonly use low bitwidth for most values, selectively using higher bitwidth for outlier values. While this approach helps achieve high accuracy and low bitwidth simultaneously, it comes with the limitation that cost for online outlier detection is excessively high, negating the advantages. We propose Oaken, an acceleration solution that achieves high accuracy and high performance simultaneously through co-designing algorithm and hardware. To effectively find a sweet spot in the accuracy-performance trade-off space of KV cache quantization, Oaken employs an online-offline hybrid approach, setting outlier thresholds offline, which are then used to determine the quantization scale online. To translate the proposed algorithmic technique into tangible performance gains, Oaken also comes with custom quantization engines and memory management units that can be integrated with any LLM accelerators. We built an Oaken accelerator on top of an LLM accelerator, LPU, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation. Our experiments show that for a batch size of 256, Oaken achieves up to 1.58x throughput improvement over NVIDIA A100 GPU, incurring a minimal accuracy loss of only 0.54\% on average, compared to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization techniques."
2503.18773,"The rise of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) amplifies memory and bandwidth demands during autoregressive decoding, as the Key-Value (KV) cache grows with each generated token. Low-bit KV-cache quantization (e.g., 4-bit or 2-bit) can reduce memory footprint while preserving accuracy, but existing systems suffer from slow decoding due to their exclusive reliance on CUDA cores, neglecting Tensor Cores (the primary source of compute on modern GPUs). We present BitDecoding, a new long-context LLM inference system with a low-bit KV cache. BitDecoding enables efficient low-bit KV-cache decoding by cooperatively leveraging CUDA cores and Tensor Cores. It introduces methods for automatically inducing optimized layouts to exploit Tensor Cores, along with warp-level parallelization strategies for dequantization. For unified system support, BitDecoding includes a query transformation module supporting diverse attention variants, a quantization kernel that supports both tensor-wise and channel-wise scaling used in various quantization algorithms with high performance, and a dequantization kernel with a software-defined pipeline to coordinate CUDA and Tensor Cores execution for mixed-precision operations. Evaluated on RTX 4090, A100, and H100, BitDecoding accelerates decoding by up to 7.5x, 4.8x, and 8.9x, respectively, over FP16 FlashDecoding-v2, and surpasses the state-of-the-art low-bit system QServe by up to 4.3x. On LLaMA-3.1-8B with a 128K context, BitDecoding reduces single-batch decoding latency by 3x, showing substantial improvements for long-context generation. The code is available atthis https URL."
2503.18869,"The efficiency of Large Language Model~(LLM) inference is often constrained by substantial memory bandwidth and capacity demands. Existing techniques, such as pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity and/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference quality. This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory bottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to achieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and bandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of model weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality, and (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale proportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. These goals are accomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to improve fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and KV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and representation. Experimental results on publicly available LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing memory footprint reductions of 25.2\% for model weights and 46.9\% for KV cache. In addition, our hardware prototype at 4\,GHz and 32 lanes (7\,nm) achieves 8\,TB/s throughput with a modest area overhead (under 3.8\,mm\(^2\)), which underscores the viability of LLM-aware memory control as a key to efficient large-scale inference."
2503.1918,"Addressing TedX, Amber Huffman made an impassioned case that ""none of us is as smart as all of us"" and that open-source hardware is the future. A major contribution to software quality, open source and otherwise, on the software side, is the systems design methodology of Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD), which we propose to systematically bring to hardware designs and their specifications. To do so, we automatically generate specifications using specification mining, ""a machine learning approach to discovering formal specifications"" which dramatically impacted the ability of software engineers to achieve quality, verification, and security. Yet applying the same techniques to hardware is non-trivial. We present a technique for generalized, continuous integration (CI) of hardware specification designs that continually deploys (CD) a hardware specification. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate Myrtha, a cloud-based, specification generator based on established hardware and software quality tools."
2503.1939,"Hardware prefetching plays a critical role in hiding the off-chip DRAM latency. The complexity of applications results in a wide variety of memory access patterns, prompting the development of numerous cache-prefetching algorithms. Consequently, commercial processors often employ a hybrid of these algorithms to enhance the overall prefetching performance. Nonetheless, since these prefetchers share hardware resources, conflicts arising from competing prefetching requests can negate the benefits of hardware prefetching. Under such circumstances, several prefetcher selection algorithms have been proposed to mitigate conflicts between prefetchers. However, these prior solutions suffer from two limitations. First, the input demand request allocation is inaccurate. Second, the prefetcher selection criteria are coarse-grained.In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing an efficient and widely applicable prefetcher selection algorithm--Alecto, which tailors the demand requests for each prefetcher. Every demand request is first sent to Alecto to identify suitable prefetchers before being routed to prefetchers for training and prefetching. Our analysis shows that Alecto is adept at not only harmonizing prefetching accuracy, coverage, and timeliness but also significantly enhancing the utilization of the prefetcher table, which is vital for temporal prefetching. Alecto outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based prefetcher selection algorithm--Bandit by 2.76% in single-core, and 7.56% in eight-core. For memory-intensive benchmarks, Alecto outperforms Bandit by 5.25%. Alecto consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance in scheduling various types of cache prefetchers. In addition to the performance improvement, Alecto can reduce the energy consumption associated with accessing the prefetchers' table by 48%, while only adding less than 1 KB of storage overhead."
2503.19447,"Expressing hardware designs using hardware description languages (HDLs) routinely involves using stateless signals whose values change according to their underlying registers. Unintended behaviours can arise when the stored values in these underlying registers are mutated while their dependent signals are expected to remain constant across multiple cycles. Such timing hazards are common because, with a few exceptions, existing HDLs lack abstractions for values that remain unchanged over multiple clock cycles, delegating this responsibility to hardware designers. Designers must then carefully decide whether a value should remain unchanged, sometimes even across hardware modules. This paper proposes Anvil, an HDL which statically prevents timing hazards with a novel type system. Anvil is the only HDL we know of that guarantees timing safety, i.e., absence of timing hazards, without sacrificing expressiveness for cycle-level timing control or dynamic timing behaviours. Unlike many HLS languages that abstract away the differences between registers and signals, Anvil's type system exposes them fully while capturing the timing relationships between register value mutations and signal usages to enforce timing safety. This, in turn, enables safe composition of communicating hardware modules by static enforcement of timing contracts that encode timing constraints on shared signals. Such timing contracts can be specified parametric on abstract time points that can vary during run-time, allowing the type system to statically express dynamic timing behaviour. We have implemented Anvil and successfully used it to implement key timing-sensitive modules, comparing them against open-source SystemVerilog counterparts to demonstrate the practicality and expressiveness of the generated hardware."
2503.19639,"Sparse deep learning has reduced computation significantly, but its irregular non-zero data distribution complicates the data flow and hinders data reuse, increasing on-chip SRAM access and thus power consumption of the chip. This paper addresses the aforementioned issues by maximizing data reuse to reduce SRAM access by two approaches. First, we propose Effective Index Matching (EIM), which efficiently searches and arranges non-zero operations from compressed data. Second, we propose Shared Index Data Reuse (SIDR) which coordinates the operations between Processing Elements (PEs), regularizing their SRAM data access, thereby enabling all data to be reused efficiently. Our approach reduces the access of the SRAM buffer by 86\% when compared to the previous design, SparTen. As a result, our design achieves a 2.5$\times$ improvement in power efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a simpler dataflow."
2503.19643,"This paper introduces the first low-power hardware accelerator for Spiking Transformers, an emerging alternative to traditional artificial neural networks. By modifying the base Spikformer model to use IAND instead of residual addition, the model exclusively utilizes spike computation. The hardware employs a fully parallel tick-batching dataflow and a time-step reconfigurable neuron architecture, addressing the delay and power challenges of multi-timestep processing in spiking neural networks. This approach processes outputs from all time steps in parallel, reducing computation delay and eliminating membrane memory, thereby lowering energy consumption. The accelerator supports 3x3 and 1x1 convolutions and matrix operations through vectorized processing, meeting model requirements. Implemented in TSMC's 28nm process, it achieves 3.456 TSOPS (tera spike operations per second) with a power efficiency of 38.334 TSOPS/W at 500MHz, using 198.46K logic gates and 139.25KB of SRAM."
2503.20245,"Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) is challenging to implement in resource-constrained edge devices for resolutions beyond full HD due to its high computational complexity and memory bandwidth requirements. This paper introduces an 8K@30FPS SR accelerator with edge-selective dynamic input processing. Dynamic processing chooses the appropriate subnets for different patches based on simple input edge criteria, achieving a 50\% MAC reduction with only a 0.1dB PSNR decrease. The quality of reconstruction images is guaranteed and maximized its potential with \textit{resource adaptive model switching} even under resource constraints. In conjunction with hardware-specific refinements, the model size is reduced by 84\% to 51K, but with a decrease of less than 0.6dB PSNR. Additionally, to support dynamic processing with high utilization, this design incorporates a \textit{configurable group of layer mapping} that synergizes with the \textit{structure-friendly fusion block}, resulting in 77\% hardware utilization and up to 79\% reduction in feature SRAM access.

2503.20246,"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and transformers represent two powerful paradigms in neural computation, known for their low power consumption and ability to capture feature dependencies, respectively. However, transformer architectures typically involve multiple types of computational layers, including linear layers for MLP modules and classification heads, convolution layers for tokenizers, and dot product computations for self-attention mechanisms. These diverse operations pose significant challenges for hardware accelerator design, and to our knowledge, there is not yet a hardware solution that leverages spike-form data from SNNs for transformer architectures. In this paper, we introduce VESTA, a novel hardware design that synergizes these technologies, presenting unified Processing Elements (PEs) capable of efficiently performing all three types of computations crucial to transformer structures. VESTA uniquely benefits from the spike-form outputs of the Spike Neuron Layers \cite{zhou2024spikformer}, simplifying multiplication operations by reducing them from handling two 8-bit integers to handling one 8-bit integer and a binary spike. This reduction enables the use of multiplexers in the PE module, significantly enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining the low-power advantage of SNNs. Experimental results show that the core area of VESTA is \(0.844 mm^2\). It operates at 500MHz and is capable of real-time image classification at 30 fps."

Unlike traditional datacenters that provide symmetrical node-to-node bandwidth, UB-Mesh employs a hierarchically localized nD-FullMesh network topology. This design fully leverages the data locality of LLM training, prioritizing short-range, direct interconnects to minimize data movement distance and reduce switch usage.Although UB-Mesh's nD-FullMesh topology offers several theoretical advantages, its concrete architecture design, physical implementation and networking system optimization present new challenges. For the actual construction of UB-Mesh, we first design the UB-Mesh-Pod architecture, which is based on a 4D-FullMesh topology. UB-Mesh-Pod is implemented via a suite of hardware components that serve as the foundational building blocks, including specifically-designed NPU, CPU, Low-Radix-Switch (LRS), High-Radix-Switch (HRS), NICs and others. These components are interconnected via a novel Unified Bus (UB) technique, which enables flexible IO bandwidth allocation and hardware resource pooling. For networking system optimization, we propose advanced routing mechanism named All-Path-Routing (APR) to efficiently manage data traffic. These optimizations, combined with topology-aware performance enhancements and robust reliability measures like 64+1 backup design, result in 2.04x higher cost-efficiency, 7.2% higher network availability compared to traditional Clos architecture and 95%+ linearity in various LLM training tasks."
2503.20481,"GPUs are the most popular platform for accelerating HPC workloads, such as artificial intelligence and science simulations. However, most microarchitectural research in academia relies on GPU core pipeline designs based on architectures that are more than 15 years old.This paper reverse engineers modern NVIDIA GPU cores, unveiling many key aspects of its design and explaining how GPUs leverage hardware-compiler techniques where the compiler guides hardware during execution. In particular, it reveals how the issue logic works including the policy of the issue scheduler, the structure of the register file and its associated cache, and multiple features of the memory pipeline. Moreover, it analyses how a simple instruction prefetcher based on a stream buffer fits well with modern NVIDIA GPUs and is likely to be used. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the register file cache and the number of register file read ports on both simulation accuracy and performance.By modeling all these new discovered microarchitectural details, we achieve 18.24% lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in execution cycles than previous state-of-the-art simulators, resulting in an average of 13.98% MAPE with respect to real hardware (NVIDIA RTX A6000). Also, we demonstrate that this new model stands for other NVIDIA architectures, such as Turing. Finally, we show that the software-based dependence management mechanism included in modern NVIDIA GPUs outperforms a hardware mechanism based on scoreboards in terms of performance and area."
2503.20507,"Hybrid storage systems (HSS) integrate multiple storage devices with diverse characteristics to deliver high performance and capacity at low cost. The performance of an HSS highly depends on the effectiveness of two key policies: (1) the data-placement policy, which determines the best-fit storage device for incoming data, and (2) the data-migration policy, which dynamically rearranges stored data (i.e., prefetches hot data and evicts cold data) across the devices to sustain high HSS performance. Prior works optimize either data placement or data migration in isolation, which leads to suboptimal HSS performance. Unfortunately, no prior work tries to optimize both policies together.Our goal is to design a holistic data-management technique that optimizes both data-placement and data-migration policies to fully exploit the potential of an HSS, and thus significantly improve system performance. We propose Harmonia, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based data-management technique that employs two lightweight autonomous RL agents, a data-placement agent and a data-migration agent, that adapt their policies for the current workload and HSS configuration while coordinating with each other to improve overall HSS performance.We evaluate Harmonia on real HSS configurations with up to four heterogeneous storage devices and seventeen data-intensive workloads. On performance-optimized (cost-optimized) HSS with two storage devices, Harmonia outperforms the best-performing prior approach by 49.5% (31.7%) on average. On an HSS with three (four) devices, Harmonia outperforms the best-performing prior work by 37.0% (42.0%) on average. Harmonia's performance benefits come with low latency (240ns for inference) and storage overheads (206 KiB in DRAM for both RL agents combined). We will open-source Harmonia's implementation to aid future research on HSS."

In this context, single-issue in-order cores are commonplace, but lean dual-issue cores could boost PE IPC, especially for the common case of mixed integer and floating-point workloads. We develop the COPIFT methodology and RISC-V ISA extensions to enable low-cost and flexible dual-issue execution of mixed integer and floating-point instruction sequences. On such kernels, our methodology achieves speedups of 1.47x, reaching a peak 1.75 instructions per cycle, and 1.37x energy improvements on average, over optimized RV32G baselines."

In this context, PEs are often implemented by scalar in-order cores, which are highly sensitive to pipeline stalls. Traditional software techniques, such as loop unrolling, mitigate the issue at the cost of increased register pressure, limiting flexibility. We propose scalar chaining, a novel hardware-software solution, to address this issue without incurring the drawbacks of traditional software-only techniques. We demonstrate our solution on register-limited stencil codes, achieving >93% FPU utilizations and a 4% speedup and 10% higher energy efficiency, on average, over highly-optimized baselines. Our implementation is fully open source and performance experiments are reproducible using free software."

However, the vast design space of such hardware, coupled with the complexity of their spatial hierarchies and organizations, introduces significant challenges for design space exploration (DSE). Existing DSE tools, which rely on predefined hardware templates to explore parameters for specific architectures, fall short in exploring diverse organizations, spatial hierarchies, and architectural polymorphisms inherent in multi-level hardware. To address these limitations, we present Multi-Level Design Space Exploror (MLDSE), a novel infrastructure for domain-specific DSE of multi-level hardware. MLDSE introduces three key innovations from three basic perspectives of DSE: 1) Modeling: MLDSE introduces a hardware intermediate representation (IR) that can recursively model diverse multi-level hardware with composable elements at various granularities. 2) Mapping: MLDSE provides a comprehensive spatiotemporal mapping IR and mapping primitives, facilitating the mapping strategy exploration on multi-level hardware, especially synchronization and cross-level communication; 3) Simulation: MLDSE supports universal simulator generation based on task-level event-driven simulation mechanism. It features a hardware-consistent scheduling algorithm that can handle general task-level resource contention. Through experiments on LLM workloads, we demonstrate MLDSE's unique capability to perform three-tier DSE spanning architecture, hardware parameter, and mapping."

However, their heterogeneous and complex structure restricts model compression potential, resulting in greater complexity and reduced hardware efficiency. Additionally, these models are not tailored for streaming and low-power applications. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a low-power streaming speech enhancement accelerator through model and hardware optimization. The proposed high performance model is optimized for hardware execution with the co-design of model compression and target application, which reduces 93.9\% of model size by the proposed domain-aware and streaming-aware pruning techniques. The required latency is further reduced with batch normalization-based transformers. Additionally, we employed softmax-free attention, complemented by an extra batch normalization, facilitating simpler hardware design. The tailored hardware accommodates these diverse computing patterns by breaking them down into element-wise multiplication and accumulation (MAC). This is achieved through a 1-D processing array, utilizing configurable SRAM addressing, thereby minimizing hardware complexities and simplifying zero skipping. Using the TSMC 40nm CMOS process, the final implementation requires merely 207.8K gates and 53.75KB SRAM. It consumes only 8.08 mW for real-time inference at a 62.5MHz frequency."

Achieved through algorithm and hardware co-optimizations, we propose a compact recurrent spiking neural network with two recurrent layers, one fully connected layer, and a low time step (1 or 2). The 2.79-MB model undergoes pruning and 4-bit fixed-point quantization, shrinking it by 96.42\% to 0.1 MB. On the hardware front, we take advantage of \textit{mixed-level pruning}, \textit{zero-skipping} and \textit{merged spike} techniques, reducing complexity by 90.49\% to 13.86 MMAC/S. The \textit{parallel time-step execution} addresses inter-time-step data dependencies and enables weight buffer power savings through weight sharing. Capitalizing on the sparse spike activity, an input broadcasting scheme eliminates zero computations, further saving power. Implemented on the TSMC 28-nm process, the design operates in real time at 100 kHz, consuming 71.2 $\mu$W, surpassing state-of-the-art designs.

However, the adoption of computing in these domains is hindered by strict area and power constraints, limiting the effectiveness of general-purpose microprocessors. This paper proposes a bespoke microprocessor design approach to address these challenges, by tailoring the design to specific applications and eliminating unnecessary logic. Targeting machine learning applications, we further optimize core operations by integrating a SIMD MAC unit supporting 4 precision configurations that boost the efficiency of microprocessors. Our evaluation across 6 ML models and the large-scale Zero-Riscy core, shows that our methodology can achieve improvements of 22.2%, 23.6%, and 33.79% in area, power, and speed, respectively, without compromising accuracy. Against state-of-the-art printed processors, our approach can still offer significant speedups, but along with some accuracy degradation.

While DRAM offers low latency and high throughput, it is constrained by high costs, scalability challenges, and volatility, making it less viable for capacity-bound and persistent applications in modern datacenters.Recently, Compute Express Link (CXL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling high-speed, cacheline-granular communication between CPUs and external devices. By leveraging CXL technology, NAND flash can now be used as memory expansion, offering three-fold benefits: byte-addressability, scalable capacity, and persistence at a low cost. Samsung's CXL Memory Module Hybrid (CMM-H) is the first product to deliver these benefits through a hardware-only solution, i.e., it does not incur any OS and IO overheads like conventional block devices. In particular, CMM-H integrates a DRAM cache with NAND flash in a single device to deliver near-DRAM latency. This paper presents the first publicly available study for comprehensive characterizations of an FPGA-based CMM-H prototype. Through this study, we address users' concerns about whether a wide variety of applications can successfully run on a memory device backed by NAND flash medium. Additionally, based on these characterizations, we provide key insights into how to best take advantage of the CMM-H device."
2503.22044,"Compute-in-memory (CIM) based neural network accelerators offer a promising solution to the Von Neumann bottleneck by computing directly within memory arrays. However, SRAM CIM faces limitations in executing larger models due to its cell size and on-chip memory constraints. This work proposes CIMPool, a CIM-aware compression and acceleration framework that counters this limitation through a weight sharing-based compression technique, aptly named `Weight Pool,' enabling significantly larger neural networks to be accommodated within on-chip memory constraints. This method minimizes the accuracy trade-off typically associated with parameter compression, allowing CIMPool to achieve a significantly larger compression ratio compared to the traditional quantization method with iso-accuracy.Furthermore, CIMPool co-optimizes the compression algorithm, hardware, and dataflow to efficiently implement the hardware permutation required by weight pool compression, with negligible area and throughput overhead. Empirical results demonstrate that CIMPool can achieve 8-bit level accuracy with an effective 0.5-bit precision, reduce chip area by 62.3% for ResNet-18, and enable the execution of an order of magnitude larger models for a given area budget in SRAM CIMs. When DRAM is used to store weights, CIMPool can reduce the total energy by 3.24x compared to iso-accuracy traditional CIMs."

This paper proposes architectural extensions to a baseline Reconfigurable Dataflow Unit (RDU) that efficiently support FFT-based and scan-based SSMs. By introducing lightweight interconnect enhancements within compute tiles, the extended RDU enables spatial mapping of FFT and scan dataflows with less than 1% area and power overhead. The resulting architecture achieves a 5.95X speedup over the GPU and a 1.95X speedup over the baseline RDU for Hyena, and a 2.12X and 1.75X speedup over the GPU and baseline RDU, respectively, for Mamba."

We present Concorde, a new methodology for learning fast and accurate performance models of microarchitectures. Unlike existing simulators and learning approaches that emulate each instruction, Concorde predicts the behavior of a program based on compact performance distributions that capture the impact of different microarchitectural components. It derives these performance distributions using simple analytical models that estimate bounds on performance induced by each microarchitectural component, providing a simple yet rich representation of a program's performance characteristics across a large space of microarchitectural parameters. Experiments show that Concorde is more than five orders of magnitude faster than a reference cycle-level simulator, with about 2% average Cycles-Per-Instruction (CPI) prediction error across a range of SPEC, open-source, and proprietary benchmarks. This enables rapid design-space exploration and performance sensitivity analyses that are currently infeasible, e.g., in about an hour, we conducted a first-of-its-kind fine-grained performance attribution to different microarchitectural components across a diverse set of programs, requiring nearly 150 million CPI evaluations."

Processing-Using-DRAM (PUD), an analog in-DRAM computing technique, has the potential to repurpose on-device DRAM as a GeMV engine, offering additional high-throughput processing capabilities to widespread consumer devices without DRAM modifications. However, applying PUD to GeMV operations in the LLM inference pipeline incurs significant overheads $\textit{before}$ and $\textit{after}$ in-DRAM computation, diminishing the benefits of its high-throughput processing capabilities.This paper presents MVDRAM, the first practical system to accelerate GeMV operations for low-bit LLM inference using unmodified DRAM. By leveraging the data sharing patterns and mathematical linearity in GeMV operations, MVDRAM orchestrates the processor and DRAM to eliminate the costs associated with pre-arranging inputs and bit-transposition of outputs required in conventional PUD approaches. Our experimental evaluation with four DDR4 DRAM modules shows that MVDRAM achieves comparable or even better inference speed than the processor-based implementation for GeMV operations in low-bit (under 4-bit) LLM. In particular, MVDRAM achieves up to 7.29$\times$ speedup and 30.5$\times$ energy efficiency for low-bit GeMV operations. For end-to-end LLM inference, MVDRAM achieves 2.18$\times$ and 1.31$\times$ throughput improvements, along with 3.04$\times$ and 2.35$\times$ energy efficiency, for 2-bit and 4-bit quantized low-bit models, respectively.

DOMAC establishes an analogy between optimizing multi-staged parallel compressor trees and training deep neural networks. Building on this insight, DOMAC reformulates the discrete optimization challenge into a continuous problem by incorporating differentiable timing and area objectives.

However, the significant time for EDA tool invocations and complex interplay among numerous design parameters make this task extremely challenging, even for experienced designers. To address these challenges, we introduce DiffuSE, a diffusion-driven design space exploration framework for cross-layer optimization of DNN accelerators. DiffuSE leverages conditional diffusion models to capture the inverse, one-to-many mapping from QoR objectives to parameter combinations, allowing for targeted exploration within promising regions of the design space.

As accelerators are vulnerable to hardware faults due to aging, variation, etc, existing accelerator designs often reserve a large voltage margin or leverage algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques to ensure LLM inference correctness. However, previous methods often overlook the inherent fault tolerance of LLMs, leading to high computation and energy overhead. To enable reliable yet efficient LLM inference, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm/circuit co-design framework, dubbed ReaLM. For the first time, we systematically characterize the fault tolerance of LLMs by performing a large-scale error injection study of representative LLMs and natural language understanding tasks. Then, we propose a statistical ABFT algorithm that fully leverages the error robustness to minimize error recovery as much as possible. We also customize the error detection circuits to enable a low-cost online collection of error statistics. Extensive experiments show that with only 1.42% circuit area and 1.79% power overhead, our ReaLM can reduce perplexity degradation from 18.54 to 0.29. Compared to existing methods, ReaLM consistently reduces recovery costs across different operating voltages and improves energy efficiency by up to 35.83% without compromising LLM performance.

In this paper we architect and evaluate soft SIMT processor banked memories, which can support high bandwidth (up to 16 ports) while maintaining high speed (over 770 MHz). We compare 9 different memory architectures, including simpler multi-port memories, and run a total of 51 benchmarks (different combinations of algorithms, data sizes and processor memories) to develop a comprehensive set of data which will guide the reader in making an informed memory architecture decision for their application. Our benchmarks are comprised of matrix transpositions (memory intensive) and FFTs (split between memory accesses, floating point, and integer computations) to provide a balanced evaluation. We show that the simpler (but more memory block intensive) multi-port memories offer higher performance than the more architecturally complex banked memories for many applications, especially for smaller memories, but the effective footprint cost of the multi-port memories quickly becomes prohibitive as dataset sizes increase. Our banked memory implementation results - high bandwidth, high Fmax, and high density - can be used for other FPGA applications as well, such as HLS (High Level Synthesis)."

By pre-executing the application code during occurrences of long-latency operations and prefetching anticipated cache-missed data into the cache hierarchy, runahead effectively masks memory latency for subsequent cache misses and achieves high prefetching accuracy; however, this technique has been limited to superscalar out-of-order and superscalar in-order cores. For implementation in scalar in-order cores, the challenges of area-/energy-constraint and severe cache contention remain.Here, we build the first full-stack system featuring runahead, MERE, from SoC and a dedicated ISA to the OS and programming model. Through this deployment, we show that enabling runahead in scalar in-order cores is possible, with minimal area and power overheads, while still achieving high performance. By re-constructing the sequential runahead employing a hardware/software co-design approach, the system can be implemented on a mature processor and SoC. Building on this, an adaptive runahead mechanism is proposed to mitigate the severe cache contention in scalar in-order cores. Combining this, we provide a comprehensive solution for embedded processors managing irregular workloads. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed MERE attains 93.5% of a 2-wide out-of-order core's performance while constraining area and power overheads below 5%, with the adaptive runahead mechanism delivering an additional 20.1% performance gain through mitigating the severe cache contention issues."

Due to the increasing volume of data a DBMS deals with, current processor-centric architectures (e.g., CPUs, GPUs) suffer from data movement bottlenecks when executing key DBMS operations (e.g., selection, aggregation, ordering, and join). This happens mostly due to the limited memory bandwidth between compute and memory resources.

Previous works have evaluated using PIM for data analytics. However, they either do not use real-world architectures or they consider only a subset of the operators used in analytical queries. This work aims to fully evaluate a data-centric approach to data analytics, by using the real-world UPMEM PIM system. To this end we first present the PIM Data Analytics Library (PIMDAL), which implements four major DB operators: selection, aggregation, ordering and join. Second, we use hardware performance metrics to understand which properties of a PIM system are important for a high-performance implementation. Third, we compare PIMDAL to reference implementations on high-end CPU and GPU systems. Fourth, we use PIMDAL to implement five TPC-H queries to gain insights into analytical queries. We analyze and show how to overcome the three main limitations of the UPMEM system when implementing DB operators: (I) low arithmetic performance, (II) explicit memory management and (III) limited communication between compute units.

Successful LLM-based agents for hardware design can drastically reduce TAT, leading to faster product cycles, lower costs, improved design reliability and reduced risk of costly errors. In this work, we propose a unified framework, Marco, that integrates configurable graph-based task solving with multi-modality and multi-AI agents for chip design by leveraging the natural language and reasoning abilities with collaborative toolkits. Lastly, we demonstrate promising performance, productivity, and efficiency of LLM agents by leveraging the Marco framework on layout optimization, Verilog/design rule checker (DRC) coding, and timing analysis tasks."

2504.01981,"This paper introduces Natural-Level Synthesis, an innovative approach for generating hardware using generative artificial intelligence on both the system level and component-level. NLS bridges a gap in current hardware development processes, where algorithm and application engineers' involvement typically ends at the requirements stage. With NLS, engineers can participate more deeply in the development, synthesis, and test stages by using Gen-AI models to convert natural language descriptions directly into Hardware Description Language code. This approach not only streamlines hardware development but also improves accessibility, fostering a collaborative workflow between hardware and algorithm engineers. We developed the NLS tool to facilitate natural language-driven HDL synthesis, enabling rapid generation of system-level HDL designs while significantly reducing development complexity. Evaluated through case studies and benchmarks using Performance, Power, and Area metrics, NLS shows its potential to enhance resource efficiency in hardware development. This work provides a extensible, efficient solution for hardware synthesis and establishes a Visual Studio Code Extension to assess Gen-AI-driven HDL generation and system integration, laying a foundation for future AI-enhanced and AI-in-the-loop Electronic Design Automation tools."
2504.01986,"The rapid advancements in LLMs have driven the adoption of generative AI in various domains, including Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Unlike traditional software development, EDA presents unique challenges, as generated RTL code must not only be syntactically correct and functionally accurate but also synthesizable by hardware generators while meeting performance, power, and area constraints. These additional requirements introduce complexities that existing code-generation benchmarks often fail to capture, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating LLMs for RTL generation. To address this gap, we propose TuRTLe, a unified evaluation framework designed to systematically assess LLMs across key RTL generation tasks. TuRTLe integrates multiple existing benchmarks and automates the evaluation process, enabling a comprehensive assessment of LLM performance in syntax correctness, functional correctness, synthesis, PPA optimization, and exact line completion. Using this framework, we benchmark a diverse set of open LLMs and analyze their strengths and weaknesses in EDA-specific tasks. Our results show that reasoning-based models, such as DeepSeek R1, consistently outperform others across multiple evaluation criteria, but at the cost of increased computational overhead and inference latency. Additionally, base models are better suited in module completion tasks, while instruct-tuned models perform better in specification-to-RTL tasks."

Our design achieves up to roughly 80x improvement in tokens per second and a 70% increase in tokens per joule compared to conventional hardware accelerators. Additionally, PIM-LLM outperforms previous PIM-based LLM accelerators, setting a new benchmark with at least 2x and 5x improvement in GOPS and GOPS/W, respectively."
2504.02533,"Modern data-driven applications expose limitations of von Neumann architectures - extensive data movement, low throughput, and poor energy efficiency. Accelerators improve performance but lack flexibility and require data transfers. Existing compute in- and near-memory solutions mitigate these issues but face usability challenges due to data placement constraints. We propose a novel cache architecture that doubles as a tightly-coupled compute-near-memory coprocessor. Our RISC-V cache controller executes custom instructions from the host CPU using vector operations dispatched to near-memory vector processing units within the cache memory subsystem. This architecture abstracts memory synchronization and data mapping from application software while offering software-based Instruction Set Architecture extensibility.

2504.03083,"There has been a growing interest in executing machine learning (ML) workloads on the client side for reasons of customizability, privacy, performance, and availability. In response, hardware manufacturers have begun to incorporate so-called Neural Processing Units (NPUs) into their processors for consumer devices. Such dedicated hardware optimizes both power efficiency and throughput for common machine learning tasks. AMD's NPU, part of their Ryzen AI processors, is one of the first such accelerators integrated into a chip with an x86 processor. AMD supports bare-metal programming of their NPU rather than limiting programmers to pre-configured libraries.In this paper, we explore the potential of using a bare-metal toolchain to accelerate the weight fine-tuning of a large language model, GPT-2, entirely on the client side using the AMD NPU. Fine-tuning on the edge allows for private customization of a model to a specific use case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such an accelerator has been used to perform training on the client side. We offload time-intensive matrix multiplication operations from the CPU onto the NPU, achieving a speedup of over 2.8x for these operations. This improves end-to-end performance of the model in terms of throughput (1.7x and 1.2x speedup in FLOPS/s on mains and battery power, respectively) and energy efficiency (1.4x improvement in FLOPS/Ws on battery power). We detail our implementation approach and present an in-depth exploration of the NPU hardware and bare-metal tool-flow."
2504.03451,"Linear-response time-dependent Density Functional Theory (LR-TDDFT) is a widely used method for accurately predicting the excited-state properties of physical systems. Previous works have attempted to accelerate LR-TDDFT using heterogeneous systems such as GPUs, FPGAs, and the Sunway architecture. However, a major drawback of these approaches is the constant data movement between host memory and the memory of the heterogeneous systems, which results in substantial \textit{data movement overhead}. Moreover, these works focus primarily on optimizing the compute-intensive portions of LR-TDDFT, despite the fact that the calculation steps are fundamentally \textit{memory-bound}.To address these challenges, we propose NDFT, a \underline{N}ear-\underline{D}ata Density \underline{F}unctional \underline{T}heory framework. Specifically, we design a novel task partitioning and scheduling mechanism to offload each part of LR-TDDFT to the most suitable computing units within a CPU-NDP system. Additionally, we implement a hardware/software co-optimization of a critical kernel in LR-TDDFT to further enhance performance on the CPU-NDP system. Our results show that NDFT achieves performance improvements of 5.2x and 2.5x over CPU and GPU baselines, respectively, on a large physical system."
2504.03675,"As computational paradigms evolve, applications such as attention-based models, wireless telecommunications, and computer vision impose increasingly challenging requirements on computer architectures: significant memory footprints and computing resources are demanded while maintaining flexibility and programmability at a low power budget. Thanks to their advantageous trade-offs, shared-L1-memory clusters have become a common building block of massively parallel computing architectures tackling these issues. MemPool is an open-source, RISC-V-based manycore cluster scaling up to 1024 processing elements (PEs). MemPool offers a scalable, extensible, and programmable solution to the challenges of shared-L1 clusters, establishing itself as an open-source research platform for architectural variants covering a wide trade-off space between versatility and performance. As a demonstration, this paper compares the three main MemPool flavors, Baseline MemPool, Systolic MemPool, and Vectorial MemPool, detailing their architecture, targets, and achieved trade-offs."
2504.03676,"The success of DNNs and their high computational requirements pushed for large codesign efforts aiming at DNN acceleration. Since DNNs can be represented as static computational graphs, static memory allocation and tiling are two crucial optimizations. Hence, SoCs specialized for DNN acceleration commonly features a multi-level software-managed memory hierarchy. In such architecture, layer-wise tiling, i.e., splitting each layer into multiple sub-nodes, is commonly used; however, while reducing memory occupation, it can increase the total memory transfer, ultimately causing costly off-chip memory copies, which impact energy efficiency and create memory bottlenecks. This work proposes Fused-Tiled Layers, a novel algorithm for automatic fusion between tiled layers. We leverage the flexibility and efficiency of a RISC-V (RV32) heterogeneous SoC to integrate FTL in an open-source deployment framework, which we tune for RISC-V targets. We demonstrate that FTL brings up to 60.1% runtime reduction for a typical MLP stage of ViT due to the reduction of off-chip transfer and on-chip data movement by 47.1%."

However, leveraging heterogeneous SoCs within high-level applications is a tedious task. In this preliminary work, we modify the OpenBLAS library to offload selected linear kernels to a programmable manycore accelerator (PMCA) using OpenMP. By linking the Python package Numpy against this library, we enable acceleration of high-level applications. We target an open-source heterogeneous System-on-Chip with a rv64g Linux capable host and a rv32imafd PMCA. Using this platform emulated on FPGA, and the presented software stack, we can accelerate Phyton applications with linear algebra operators like matrix multiplication."
2504.03711,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven electronic design automation (EDA) techniques have been extensively explored for VLSI circuit design applications. Most recently, foundation AI models for circuits have emerged as a new technology trend. Unlike traditional task-specific AI solutions, these new AI models are developed through two stages: 1) self-supervised pre-training on a large amount of unlabeled data to learn intrinsic circuit properties; and 2) efficient fine-tuning for specific downstream applications, such as early-stage design quality evaluation, circuit-related context generation, and functional verification. This new paradigm brings many advantages: model generalization, less reliance on labeled circuit data, efficient adaptation to new tasks, and unprecedented generative capability. In this paper, we propose referring to AI models developed with this new paradigm as circuit foundation models (CFMs). This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the latest progress in circuit foundation models, unprecedentedly covering over 130 relevant works. Over 90% of our introduced works were published in or after 2022, indicating that this emerging research trend has attracted wide attention in a short period. In this survey, we propose to categorize all existing circuit foundation models into two primary types: 1) encoder-based methods performing general circuit representation learning for predictive tasks; and 2) decoder-based methods leveraging large language models (LLMs) for generative tasks. For our introduced works, we cover their input modalities, model architecture, pre-training strategies, domain adaptation techniques, and downstream design applications. In addition, this paper discussed the unique properties of circuits from the data perspective. These circuit properties have motivated many works in this domain and differentiated them from general AI techniques."

2504.03723,"Hardware design automation faces challenges in generating high-quality Verilog code efficiently. This paper introduces VFlow, an automated framework that optimizes agentic workflows for Verilog code generation. Unlike traditional approaches relying on fixed prompts or manually designed flows, VFlow treats workflow discovery as a search over graph-structured LLM invocation sequences. It introduces a multi-population cooperative evolution (CEPE-MCTS) algorithm that balances multiple hardware objectives -- functional correctness, area, power, timing and token cost -- while sharing successful patterns and avoiding repeated failures. Integrated multi-level verification ensures syntactic correctness, functional behavior, and synthesizability. Experiments on VerilogEval and RTLLM2.0 show VFlow improves pass@1 by 20--30\% over prompting baselines and closely matches designer-level area/power. Remarkably, VFlow enables small LLMs to outperform larger models with up to 10.9$\times$ ROI, offering a cost-effective solution for RTL design.

2504.03732,"Genome sequence analysis, which analyzes the DNA sequences of organisms, drives advances in many critical medical and biotechnological fields. Given its importance and the exponentially growing volumes of genomic sequence data, there are extensive efforts to accelerate genome sequence analysis. In this work, we demonstrate a major bottleneck that greatly limits and diminishes the benefits of state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators: the data preparation bottleneck, where genomic sequence data is stored in compressed form and needs to be decompressed and formatted first before an accelerator can operate on it. To mitigate this bottleneck, we propose SAGe, an algorithm-architecture co-design for highly-compressed storage and high-performance access of large-scale genomic sequence data. The key challenge is to improve data preparation performance while maintaining high compression ratios (comparable to genomic-specific compression algorithms) at low hardware cost. We address this challenge by leveraging key properties of genomic datasets to co-design (i) a new (de)compression algorithm, (ii) hardware that decompresses data with lightweight operations and efficient streaming accesses, (iii) storage data layout, and (iv) interface commands to access data. SAGe is highly versatile as it supports datasets from different sequencing technologies and species. Thanks to its lightweight design, SAGe can be seamlessly integrated with a broad range of genome sequence analysis hardware accelerators to mitigate their data preparation bottlenecks. Our results demonstrate that SAGe improves the average end-to-end performance and energy efficiency of two state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators by 3.0x-32.1x and 13.0x-34.0x, respectively, compared to when the accelerators rely on state-of-the-art decompression tools."

Traditional retraining methods are limited by RRAM's high energy consumption, write latency, and endurance constraints. We propose a DoRA-based calibration framework that restores accuracy by compensating influential weights with minimal calibration parameters stored in SRAM, leaving RRAM weights untouched. This eliminates in-field RRAM writes, ensuring energy-efficient, fast, and reliable calibration. Experiments on RIMC-based ResNet50 (ImageNet-1K) demonstrate 69.53% accuracy restoration using just 10 calibration samples while updating only 2.34% of parameters."
2504.03879,"High-level synthesis (HLS) accelerates FPGA design by rapidly generating diverse implementations using optimization directives. However, even with cycle-accurate C/RTL co-simulation, the reported clock cycles often differ significantly from actual FPGA performance. This discrepancy hampers accurate bottleneck identification, leading to suboptimal design choices. Existing in-FPGA profiling tools, such as the Integrated Logic Analyzer (ILA), require tedious inspection of HLS-generated RTL and manual signal monitoring, reducing productivity. To address these challenges, we introduce RealProbe, the first fully automated, lightweight in-FPGA profiling tool for HLS designs. With a single directive--#pragma HLS RealProbe--the tool automatically generates all necessary code to profile cycle counts across the full function hierarchy, including submodules and loops. RealProbe extracts, records, and visualizes cycle counts with high precision, providing actionable insights into on-board performance. RealProbe is non-intrusive, implemented as independent logic to ensure minimal impact on kernel functionality or timing. It also supports automated design space exploration (DSE), optimizing resource allocation based on FPGA constraints and module complexity. By leveraging incremental synthesis and implementation, DSE runs independently of the original HLS kernel. Evaluated across 28 diverse test cases, including a large-scale design, RealProbe achieves 100% accuracy in capturing cycle counts with minimal logic overhead-just 16.98% LUTs, 43.15% FFs, and 0% BRAM usage. The tool, with full documentation and examples, is available on GitHub atthis https URL."
2504.04005,"The rapid growth of multi-core systems highlights the need for efficient Network-on-Chip (NoC) design to ensure seamless communication. Cache coherence, essential for data consistency, substantially reduces task computation time by enabling data sharing among caches. As a result, routing serves two roles: facilitating data sharing (influenced by topology) and managing NoC-level communication. However, cache coherence is often overlooked in routing, causing mismatches between design expectations and evaluation outcomes. Two main challenges are the lack of specialized tools to assess cache coherence's impact and the neglect of topology selection in routing. In this work, we propose a cache coherence-aware routing approach with integrated topology selection, guided by our Cache Coherence Traffic Analyzer (CCTA). Our method achieves up to 10.52% lower packet latency, 55.51% faster execution time, and 49.02% total energy savings, underscoring the critical role of cache coherence in NoC design and enabling effective co-design."
2504.04223,"This paper presents a coupled ring oscillator based Potts ma chine to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems(COPs). Potts model is a generalization of the Ising model, cap turing multivalued spins in contrast to the binary-valued spinsallowed in the Ising model. Similar to recent literature on Isingmachines, the proposed architecture of Potts machines imple ments the Potts model with interacting spins represented by cou pled ring oscillators. Unlike Ising machines which are limitedto two spin values, Potts machines model COPs that require alarger number of spin values. A major novelty of the proposedPotts machine is the utilization of the N-SHIL (Sub-HarmonicInjection Locking) mechanism, where multiple stable phases areobtained from a single (i.e. ring) oscillator. In evaluation, 3 coloring problems from the DIMACS SATBLIB benchmark andtwo randomly generated larger problems are mapped to the pro posed architecture. The proposed architecture is demonstratedto solve problems of varying size with 89% to 92% accuracyaveraged over multiple iterations. The simulation results showthat there is no degradation in accuracy, no significant increasein solution time, and only a linear increase in power dissipationwith increasing problem sizes up to 2000 nodes."
2504.04498,"To satisfy automotive safety and security requirements, memory protection mechanisms are an essential component of automotive microcontrollers. In today's available systems, either a fully physical address-based protection is implemented utilizing a memory protection unit, or a memory management unit takes care of memory protection while also mapping virtual addresses to physical addresses. The possibility to develop software using a large virtual address space, which is agnostic to the underlying physical address space, allows for easier software development and integration, especially in the context of virtualization. In this work, we showcase an extension to the current RISC-V SPMP proposal that enables address redirection for selected address regions, while maintaining the fully deterministic behavior of a memory protection unit."
2504.04661,"Compared to overlay-based tensor architectures like VTA or Gemmini, compilers that directly translate machine learning models into a dataflow architecture as HLS code, such as HLS4ML and FINN, generally can achieve lower latency by generating customized matrix-vector multipliers and memory structures tailored to the specific fundamental tensor operations required by each layer. However, this approach has significant drawbacks: the compilation process is highly time-consuming and the resulting deployments have unpredictable area and latency, making it impractical to constrain the latency while simultaneously minimizing area. Currently, no existing methods address this type of optimization. In this paper, we present N-TORC (Native Tensor Optimizer for Real-Time Constraints), a novel approach that utilizes data-driven performance and resource models to optimize individual layers of a dataflow architecture. When combined with model hyperparameter optimization, N-TORC can quickly generate architectures that satisfy latency constraints while simultaneously optimizing for both accuracy and resource cost (i.e. offering a set of optimal trade-offs between cost and accuracy). To demonstrate its effectiveness, we applied this framework to a cyber-physical application, DROPBEAR (Dynamic Reproduction of Projectiles in Ballistic Environments for Advanced Research). N-TORC's HLS4ML performance and resource models achieve higher accuracy than prior efforts, and its Mixed Integer Program (MIP)-based solver generates equivalent solutions to a stochastic search in 1000X less time."

By tapping the potentials of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), we propose an FPGA-assisted System-on-Chip (SoC) platform that facilitates cross-verification by the embedded CPU and the synthesized hardware in the programmable fabrics. This method accelerates the verification of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) processor at a speed of 5 million instructions per second (MIPS), which is 150x faster than the vendor-specific tool (Xilinx XSim) and a 35x boost to the state-of-the-art open-source verification setup (Verilator). With less than 7\% hardware occupation on Zynq 7000 FPGA, the proposed framework enables flexible verification with high time and cost efficiency for exploring RISC-V instruction set architectures."
2504.05577,"Boolean symbolic reasoning for gate-level netlists is a critical step in verification, logic and datapath synthesis, and hardware security. Specifically, reasoning datapath and adder tree in bit-blasted Boolean networks is particularly crucial for verification and synthesis, and challenging. Conventional approaches either fail to accurately (exactly) identify the function blocks of the designs in gate-level netlist with structural hashing and symbolic propagation, or their reasoning performance is highly sensitive to structure modifications caused by technology mapping or logic optimization. This paper introduces BoolE, an exact symbolic reasoning framework for Boolean netlists using equality saturation. BoolE optimizes scalability and performance by integrating domain-specific Boolean ruleset for term rewriting. We incorporate a novel extraction algorithm into BoolE to enhance its structural insight and computational efficiency, which adeptly identifies and captures multi-input, multi-output high-level structures (e.g., full adder) in the reconstructed e-graph.Our experiments show that BoolE surpasses state-of-the-art symbolic reasoning baselines, including the conventional functional approach (ABC) and machine learning-based method (Gamora). Specifically, we evaluated its performance on various multiplier architecture with different configurations. Our results show that BoolE identifies $3.53\times$ and $3.01\times$ more exact full adders than ABC in carry-save array and Booth-encoded multipliers, respectively. Additionally, we integrated BoolE into multiplier formal verification tasks, where it significantly accelerates the performance of traditional formal verification tools using computer algebra, demonstrated over four orders of magnitude runtime improvements."
2504.05718,"The increasing complexity of autonomous systems has driven a shift to integrated heterogeneous SoCs with real-time and safety demands. Ensuring deterministic WCETs and low-latency for critical tasks requires minimizing interference on shared resources like virtual memory. Existing techniques, such as software coloring and memory replication, introduce significant area and performance overhead, especially with virtualized memory where address translation adds latency uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose CVA6-VMRT, an extension of the open-source RISC-V CVA6 core, adding hardware support for predictability in virtual memory access with minimal area overhead. CVA6-VMRT features dynamically partitioned Translation Look-aside Buffers (TLBs) and hybrid L1 cache/scratchpad memory (SPM) functionality. It allows fine-grained per-thread control of resources, enabling the operating system to manage TLB replacements, including static overwrites, to ensure single-cycle address translation for critical memory regions. Additionally, CVA6-VMRT enables runtime partitioning of data and instruction caches into cache and SPM sections, providing low and predictable access times for critical data without impacting other accesses. In a virtualized setting, CVA6-VMRT enhances execution time determinism for critical guests by 94% during interference from non-critical guests, with minimal impact on their average absolute execution time compared to isolated execution of the critical guests only. This interference-aware behaviour is achieved with just a 4% area overhead and no timing penalty compared to the baseline CVA6 core."
2504.06134,"Spiking Neural Network (SNN) inference has a clear potential for high energy efficiency as computation is triggered by events. However, the inherent sparsity of events poses challenges for conventional computing systems, driving the development of specialized neuromorphic processors, which come with high silicon area costs and lack the flexibility needed for running other computational kernels, limiting widespread adoption. In this paper, we explore the low-level software design, parallelization, and acceleration of SNNs on general-purpose multicore clusters with a low-overhead RISC-V ISA extension for streaming sparse computations. We propose SpikeStream, an optimization technique that maps weights accesses to affine and indirect register-mapped memory streams to enhance performance, utilization, and efficiency.

2504.06211,"Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are rapidly gaining importance in privacy-preserving and verifiable computing. ZKPs enable a proving party to prove the truth of a statement to a verifying party without revealing anything else. ZKPs have applications in blockchain technologies, verifiable machine learning, and electronic voting, but have yet to see widespread adoption due to the computational complexity of the proving process. Recent works have accelerated the key primitives of state-of-the-art ZKP protocols on GPU and ASIC. However, the protocols accelerated thus far face one of two challenges: they either require a trusted setup for each application, or they generate larger proof sizes with higher verification costs, limiting their applicability in scenarios with numerous verifiers or strict verification time constraints. This work presents an accelerator, zkSpeed, for HyperPlonk, a state-of-the-art ZKP protocol that supports both one-time, universal setup and small proof sizes for typical ZKP applications in publicly verifiable, consensus-based systems. We accelerate the entire protocol, including two major primitives: SumCheck and Multi-scalar Multiplications (MSMs). We develop a full-chip architecture using 366.46 mm$^2$ and 2 TB/s of bandwidth to accelerate the entire proof generation process, achieving geometric mean speedups of 801$\times$ over CPU baselines."

Although collections of benchmarks for these languages exist, they are typically limited in size. This scarcity has recently drawn more attention due to the increasing need for training large language models in this domain. To deal with such limitation, this paper presents a methodology and a corresponding tool for generating realistic Verilog designs. The tool, ChiGen, was originally developed to test the Jasper\textregistered\ Formal Verification Platform, a product by Cadence Design Systems. Now, released as open-source software, ChiGen has been able to identify zero-day bugs in a range of tools, including Verible, Verilator, and Yosys. This paper outlines the principles behind ChiGen's design, focusing on three aspects of it: (i) generation guided by probabilistic grammars, (ii) type inference via the Hindley-Milner algorithm, and (iii) code injection enabled by data-flow analysis. Once deployed on standard hardware, ChiGen outperforms existing Verilog Fuzzers such as Verismith, TransFuzz, and VlogHammer regarding structural diversity, code coverage, and bug-finding ability."
2504.06473,"In-memory database query processing frequently involves substantial data transfers between the CPU and memory, leading to inefficiencies due to Von Neumann bottleneck. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) architectures offer a viable solution to alleviate this bottleneck. In our study, we employ a commonly used software approach that streamlines JOIN operations into simpler selection or filtering tasks using pre-join denormalization which makes query processing workload more amenable to PIM acceleration. This research explores DRAM design landscape to evaluate how effectively these filtering tasks can be efficiently executed across DRAM hierarchy and their effect on overall application speedup. We also find that operations such as aggregates are more suitably executed on the CPU rather than PIM. Thus, we propose a cooperative query processing framework that capitalizes on both CPU and PIM strengths, where (i) the DRAM-based PIM block, with its massive parallelism, supports scan operations while (ii) CPU, with its flexible architecture, supports the rest of query execution. This allows us to utilize both PIM and CPU where appropriate and prevent dramatic changes to the overall system architecture.With these minimal modifications, our methodology enables us to faithfully perform end-to-end performance evaluations using established analytics benchmarks such as TPCH and star-schema benchmark (SSB). Our findings show that this novel mapping approach improves performance, delivering a 5.92x/6.5x speedup compared to a traditional schema and 3.03-4.05x speedup compared to a denormalized schema with 9-17% memory overhead, depending on the degree of partial denormalization. Further, we provide insights into query selectivity, memory overheads, and software optimizations in the context of PIM-based filtering, which better explain the behavior and performance of these systems across the benchmarks."
2504.06474,"The increasing demand for on-device training of deep neural networks (DNNs) aims to leverage personal data for high-performance applications while addressing privacy concerns and reducing communication latency. However, resource-constrained platforms face significant challenges due to the intensive computational and memory demands of DNN training. Tensor decomposition emerges as a promising approach to compress model size without sacrificing accuracy. Nevertheless, training tensorized neural networks (TNNs) incurs non-trivial overhead and severe performance degradation on conventional accelerators due to complex tensor shaping requirements. To address these challenges, we propose FETTA, an algorithm and hardware co-optimization framework for efficient TNN training. On the algorithm side, we develop a contraction sequence search engine (CSSE) to identify the optimal contraction sequence with the minimal computational overhead. On the hardware side, FETTA features a flexible and efficient architecture equipped with a reconfigurable contraction engine (CE) array to support diverse dataflows. Furthermore, butterfly-based distribution and reduction networks are implemented to perform flexible tensor shaping operations during computation. Evaluation results demonstrate that FETTA achieves reductions of 20.5x/100.9x, 567.5x/45.03x, and 11609.7x/4544.8x in terms of processing latency, energy, and energy-delay product (EDP) over GPU and TPU, respectively.

2504.06531,"For decades, Moore's Law has served as a steadfast pillar in computer architecture and system design, promoting a clear abstraction between hardware and software. This traditional Moore's computing paradigm has deepened the rift between the two, enabling software developers to achieve near-exponential performance gains often without needing to delve deeply into hardware-specific optimizations. Yet today, Moore's Law -- with its once relentless performance gains now diminished to incremental improvements -- faces inevitable physical barriers. This stagnation necessitates a reevaluation of the conventional system design philosophy. The traditional decoupled system design philosophy, which maintains strict abstractions between hardware and software, is increasingly obsolete. The once-clear boundary between software and hardware is rapidly dissolving, replaced by co-design. It is imperative for the computing community to intensify its commitment to hardware-software co-design, elevating system abstractions to first-class citizens and reimagining design principles to satisfy the insatiable appetite of modern computing. Hardware-software co-design is not a recent innovation. To illustrate its historical evolution, I classify its development into five relatively distinct ``epochs''. This post also highlights the growing influence of the architecture community in interdisciplinary teams -- particularly alongside ML researchers -- and explores why current co-design paradigms are struggling in today's computing landscape. Additionally, I will examine the concept of the ``hardware lottery'' and explore directions to mitigate its constraining influence on the next era of computing innovation."

Therefore, data throughput specifications play a key role in modeling application performance and determining possible bottlenecks. However, while peak instruction throughputs and bandwidths for local caches are often documented, the achievable throughput can also depend on the relation between memory access and compute instructions. In this paper, we present an Arm version of the well established x86-membench throughput benchmark, which we have adapted to support all current SIMD extensions of the Armv8 instruction set architecture. We describe aspects of the Armv8 ISA that need to be considered in the portable design of this benchmark. We use the benchmark to analyze the memory subsystem at a fine spatial granularity and to unveil microarchitectural details of three processors: Fujitsu A64FX, Ampere Altra and Cavium ThunderX2. Based on the resulting performance information, we show that instruction fetch and decoder widths become a potential bottleneck for cache-bandwidth-sensitive workloads due to the load-store concept of the Arm ISA."
2504.06996,"High-quality, multi-channel neural recording is indispensable for neuroscience research and clinical applications. Large-scale brain recordings often produce vast amounts of data that must be wirelessly transmitted for subsequent offline analysis and decoding, especially in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) utilizing high-density intracortical recordings with hundreds or thousands of electrodes. However, transmitting raw neural data presents significant challenges due to limited communication bandwidth and resultant excessive heating. To address this challenge, we propose a neural signal compression scheme utilizing Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs), which achieves a compression ratio of up to 150 for compressing local field potentials (LFPs). The CAE encoder section is implemented on RAMAN, an energy-efficient tinyML accelerator designed for edge computing. RAMAN leverages sparsity in activation and weights through zero skipping, gating, and weight compression techniques. Additionally, we employ hardware-software co-optimization by pruning the CAE encoder model parameters using a hardware-aware balanced stochastic pruning strategy, resolving workload imbalance issues and eliminating indexing overhead to reduce parameter storage requirements by up to 32.4%. Post layout simulation shows that the RAMAN encoder can be implemented in a TSMC 65-nm CMOS process, occupying a core area of 0.0187 mm2 per channel. Operating at a clock frequency of 2 MHz and a supply voltage of 1.2 V, the estimated power consumption is 15.1 uW per channel for the proposed DS-CAE1 model. For functional validation, the RAMAN encoder was also deployed on an Efinix Ti60 FPGA, utilizing 37.3k LUTs and 8.6k flip-flops. The compressed neural data from RAMAN is reconstructed offline with SNDR of 22.6 dB and 27.4 dB, along with R2 scores of 0.81 and 0.94, respectively, evaluated on two monkey neural recordings."
2504.07298,"As genome sequencing is finding utility in a wide variety of domains beyond the confines of traditional medical settings, its computational pipeline faces two significant challenges. First, the creation of up to 0.5 GB of data per minute imposes substantial communication and storage overheads. Second, the sequencing pipeline is bottlenecked at the basecalling step, consuming >40% of genome analysis time. A range of proposals have attempted to address these challenges, with limited success. We propose to address these challenges with a Compute-in-Memory Basecalling Accelerator (CiMBA), the first embedded ($\sim25$mm$^2$) accelerator capable of real-time, on-device basecalling, coupled with AnaLog (AL)-Dorado, a new family of analog focused basecalling DNNs. Our resulting hardware/software co-design greatly reduces data communication overhead, is capable of a throughput of 4.77 million bases per second, 24x that required for real-time operation, and achieves 17x/27x power/area efficiency over the best prior basecalling embedded accelerator while maintaining a high accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art software basecallers."
2504.07479,"Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in various natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, the high memory and computation cost induced by the KV cache limits the inference efficiency, especially for long input sequences. Compute-in-memory (CIM)-based accelerators have been proposed for LLM acceleration with KV cache pruning. However, as existing accelerators only support static pruning with a fixed pattern or dynamic pruning with primitive implementations, they suffer from either high accuracy degradation or low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a ferroelectric FET (FeFET)-based unified content addressable memory (CAM) and CIM architecture, dubbed as UniCAIM. UniCAIM features simultaneous support for static and dynamic pruning with 3 computation modes: 1) in the CAM mode, UniCAIM enables approximate similarity measurement in O(1) time for dynamic KV cache pruning with high energy efficiency; 2) in the charge-domain CIM mode, static pruning can be supported based on accumulative similarity score, which is much more flexible compared to fixed patterns; 3) in the current-domain mode, exact attention computation can be conducted with a subset of selected KV cache. We further propose a novel CAM/CIM cell design that leverages the multi-level characteristics of FeFETs for signed multibit storage of the KV cache and in-place attention computation. With extensive experimental results, we demonstrate UniCAIM can reduce the area-energy-delay product (AEDP) by 8.2-831x over the state-ofthe-art CIM-based LLM accelerators at the circuit level, along with high accuracy comparable with dense attention at the application level, showing its great potential for efficient long-context LLM inference."
2504.07538,"Although modern FPGAs have a performance potential of a 1 GHz clock frequency - with both clock networks and embedded blocks such as memories and DSP Blocks capable of these clock rates - user implementations approaching this speed are rarely realized in practice. This is especially true of complex designs such as soft processors.In this work we implement a soft GPGPU which exceeds 950 MHz in an Altera Agilex-7 FPGA. The architecture is a 32-bit fixed point Single Instruction, Multiple Thread (SIMT) design, with parameterized thread and register spaces. Up to 4096 threads and 64K registers can be specified by the user. In one example, a processor with 16K registers and a 16KB shared memory required approximately 7K ALMs, 99 M20K memories, and 32 DSP Blocks."
2504.07555,"This paper introduces TestIt, an open-source Python package designed to automate full-system integration testing using a Software-Based Self-Test (SBST) approach. By dynamically generating test vectors and golden references, TestIt significantly reduces development time and complexity while supporting both simulation and FPGA environments. Its flexible design positions TestIt as a key enabler for the widespread adoption of CI/CD methodologies in open-source RTL development.

2504.07565,"The rapid growth of AI-based Internet-of-Things applications increased the demand for high-performance edge processing engines on a low-power budget and tight area constraints. As a consequence, vector processor architectures, traditionally designed for high-performance computing (HPC), made their way into edge devices, promising high utilization of floating-point units (FPUs) and low power consumption. However, vector processors can only exploit a single dimension of parallelism, leading to expensive accesses to the vector register file (VRF) when performing matrix computations, which are pervasive in AI workloads. To overcome these limitations while guaranteeing programmability, many researchers and companies are developing dedicated instructions for a more efficient matrix multiplication (MatMul) execution. In this context, we propose Quadrilatero, an open-source RISC-V programmable systolic array coprocessor for low-power edge applications that implements a streamlined matrix ISA extension. We evaluate the post-synthesis power, performance, and area (PPA) metrics of Quadrilatero in a mature 65-nm technology node, showing that it requires only 0.65 mm^2 and that it can reach up to 99.4% of FPU utilization. Compared to a state-of-the-art open-source RISC-V vector processor and a hybrid vector-matrix processor optimized for embedded applications, Quadrilatero improves area efficiency and energy efficiency by up to 77% and 15%, respectively."
2504.07585,"Functional languages as input specifications for High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools allow to specify data dependencies but do not contain a notion of time nor execution order. In this paper, we propose a method to add this notion to the functional description using the dataflow model SDF-AP. SDF-AP consists of patterns that express consumption and production that we can use to enforce resource usage. We created an HLS-tool that can synthesize parallel hardware, both data and control path, based on the repetition, expressed in Higher-Order Functions, combined with specified SDF-AP patterns.Our HLS-tool, based on Template Haskell, generates an Abstract Syntax Tree based on the given patterns and the functional description uses the Clash-compiler to generate VHDL/Verilog.Case studies show consistent resource consumption and temporal behavior for our HLS. A comparison with a commercially available HLS-tool shows that our HLS tool outperforms in terms of latency and sometimes in resource consumption.The method and tool presented in this paper offer more transparency to the developer and allow to specify more accurately the synthesized hardware compared to what is possible with pragmas of the Vitis HLS-tool."
2504.07595,"FPGAs provide highly parallel and customizable hardware solutions but are traditionally programmed using low-level Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) like VHDL and Verilog. These languages have a low level of abstraction and require engineers to manage control and scheduling manually. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools attempt to lift this level of abstraction by translating C/C++ code into hardware descriptions, but their reliance on imperative paradigms leads to challenges in deriving parallelism due to pointer aliasing and sequential execution models.Functional programming, with its inherent purity, immutability, and parallelism, presents a more natural abstraction for FPGA design. Existing functional hardware description tools such as Clash enable high-level circuit descriptions but lack automated scheduling and control mechanisms. Prior work by Folmer introduced a framework integrating SDF-AP graphs into Haskell for automatic hardware generation, but it lacked hierarchy and reusability.This paper extends that framework by introducing hierarchical pattern specification, enabling structured composition and scalable parallelism. Key contributions include: (1) automatic hardware generation, where both data and control paths are derived from functional specifications with hierarchical patterns, (2) parameterized buffers using GADTs, eliminating the need for manual buffer definitions and facilitating component reuse, and (3) provision of a reference ""golden model"" that can be simulated in the integrated environment for validation.The core focus of this paper is on methodology. But we also evaluate our approach against Vitis HLS, comparing both notation and resulting hardware architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that our method provides greater transparency in resource utilization and scheduling, often outperforming Vitis in both scheduling and predictability."
2504.08137,"This study presents the Cartesian Accumulative Matrix Pipeline (CAMP) architecture, a novel approach designed to enhance matrix multiplication in Vector Architectures (VAs) and Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) units. CAMP improves the processing efficiency of Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs). Matrix multiplication is a cornerstone of machine learning applications, and its quantized versions are increasingly popular for more efficient operations. Unfortunately, existing VAs and SIMD-support units struggle to efficiently handle these quantized formats. In this work, we propose CAMP, a simple yet effective architecture that leverages a hybrid multiplier. The CAMP architecture significantly advances the performance of vector architectures in handling quantized data, enabling more efficient execution of matrix multiplication across various platforms, specifically targeting the ARMv8 Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) and edge RISC-V SIMD-based architectures. In addition to increasing throughput, CAMP's architectural design also contributes to energy efficiency, making it an effective solution for low-power applications. Evaluations on a range of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) demonstrate that matrix multiplication operations using the proposed micro-architecture achieve up to 17$\times$ and 23$\times$ performance improvements compared to their respective baselines, the ARM A64FX core and a RISC-V-based edge System-on-Chip (SoC). Furthermore, synthesis and place-and-route (PnR) of the CAMP micro-architecture using Synopsys tools -- targeting ARM TSMC 7nm for A64FX and GlobalFoundries 22nm for the RISC-V SoC -- add only 1\% and 4\% area overhead, respectively, compared to the baseline designs."
2504.08334,"Vector processors frequently suffer from inefficient memory accesses, particularly for strided and segment patterns. While coalescing strided accesses is a natural solution, effectively gathering or scattering elements at fixed strides remains challenging. Naive approaches rely on high-overhead crossbars that remap any byte between memory and registers, leading to physical design issues. Segment operations require row-column transpositions, typically handled using either element-level in-place transposition (degrading performance) or large buffer-based bulk transposition (incurring high area overhead). In this paper, we present EARTH, a novel vector memory access architecture designed to overcome these challenges through shifting-based optimizations. For strided accesses, EARTH integrates specialized shift networks for gathering and scattering elements. After coalescing multiple accesses within the same cache line, data is routed between memory and registers through the shifting network with minimal overhead. For segment operations, EARTH employs a shifted register bank enabling direct column-wise access, eliminating dedicated segment buffers while providing high-performance, in-place bulk transposition. Implemented on FPGA with Chisel HDL based on an open-source RISC-V vector unit, EARTH enhances performance for strided memory accesses, achieving 4x-8x speedups in benchmarks dominated by strided operations. Compared to conventional designs, EARTH reduces hardware area by 9% and power consumption by 41%, significantly advancing both performance and efficiency of vector processors."
2504.08398,"Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has driven significant progress in image generation tasks. However, DiT inferencing is notoriously compute-intensive and incurs long latency even on datacenter-scale GPUs, primarily due to its iterative nature and heavy reliance on GEMM operations inherent to its encoder-based structure. To address the challenge, prior work has explored quantization, but achieving low-precision quantization for DiT inferencing with both high accuracy and substantial speedup remains an open problem. To this end, this paper proposes MixDiT, an algorithm-hardware co-designed acceleration solution that exploits mixed Microscaling (MX) formats to quantize DiT activation values. MixDiT quantizes the DiT activation tensors by selectively applying higher precision to magnitude-based outliers, which produce mixed-precision GEMM operations. To achieve tangible speedup from the mixed-precision arithmetic, we design a MixDiT accelerator that enables precision-flexible multiplications and efficient MX precision conversions. Our experimental results show that MixDiT delivers a speedup of 2.10-5.32 times over RTX 3090, with no loss in FID."
2504.08534,"We introduce ForgeMorph, a full-stack compiler for adaptive CNN deployment on FPGAs, combining design-time optimization with runtime reconfigurability. At compile time, the NeuroForge engine performs constraint-driven design space exploration, generating RTL mappings that are Pareto-optimal with respect to user-defined latency and resource budgets. Unlike existing FPGA compilers, which rely on static scheduling and manual tuning, NeuroForge leverages analytical performance models and multi-objective genetic algorithms to efficiently search large configuration spaces and propose highly optimized hardware implementations. At runtime, the NeuroMorph module enables dynamic reconfiguration of network width and depth without requiring redeployment. This is made possible by a novel training strategy, DistillCycle, which jointly trains the full model and its subnetworks using hierarchical knowledge distillation. As a result, each execution path maintains accuracy even under aggressive resource and power constraints. We demonstrate Forge-Morph on the Zynq-7100 using custom and benchmark models including MobileNetV2, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet, and YOLOv5. The system achieves up to 50x latency reduction and 32% lower power consumption at runtime, while matching or exceeding the efficiency of state-of-the-art compilers. ForgeMorph offers a unified solution for deployment scenarios that demand flexibility, performance, and hardware efficiency"
2504.09072,"We offer a novel approach, MGS (Markov Greedy Sums), to improve the accuracy of low-bitwidth floating-point dot products in neural network computations. In conventional 32-bit floating-point summation, adding values with different exponents may lead to loss of precision in the mantissa of the smaller term, which is right-shifted to align with the larger term's exponent. Such shifting (a.k.a. 'swamping') is a significant source of numerical errors in accumulation when implementing low-bitwidth dot products (e.g., 8-bit floating point) as the mantissa has a small number of bits. We avoid most swamping errors by arranging the terms in dot product summation based on their exponents and summing the mantissas without overflowing the low-bitwidth accumulator. We design, analyze, and implement the algorithm to minimize 8-bit floating point error at inference time for several neural networks. In contrast to traditional sequential summation, our method has significantly lowered numerical errors, achieving classification accuracy on par with high-precision floating-point baselines for multiple image classification tasks. Our dMAC hardware units can reduce power consumption by up to 34.1\% relative to conventional MAC units."
2504.09074,"The memory wall problem arises due to the disparity between fast processors and slower memory, causing significant delays in data access, even more so on edge devices. Data prefetching is a key strategy to address this, with traditional methods evolving to incorporate Machine Learning (ML) for improved accuracy. Modern prefetchers must balance high accuracy with low latency to further practicality. We explore the applicability of utilizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with learnable activation functions,a prefetcher we implemented called KANBoost, to further this aim. KANs are a novel, state-of-the-art model that work on breaking down continuous, bounded multi-variate functions into functions of their constituent variables, and use these constitutent functions as activations on each individual neuron. KANBoost predicts the next memory access by modeling deltas between consecutive addresses, offering a balance of accuracy and efficiency to mitigate the memory wall problem with minimal overhead, instead of relying on address-correlation prefetching. Initial results indicate that KAN-based prefetching reduces inference latency (18X lower than state-of-the-art ML prefetchers) while achieving moderate IPC improvements (2.5\% over no-prefetching). While KANs still face challenges in capturing long-term dependencies, we propose that future research should explore hybrid models that combine KAN efficiency with stronger sequence modeling techniques, paving the way for practical ML-based prefetching in edge devices and beyond."

2504.0926,"Circuit representation learning has shown promise in advancing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) by capturing structural and functional circuit properties for various tasks. Existing pre-trained solutions rely on graph learning with complex functional supervision, such as truth table simulation. However, they only handle simple and-inverter graphs (AIGs), struggling to fully encode other complex gate functionalities. While large language models (LLMs) excel at functional understanding, they lack the structural awareness for flattened netlists. To advance netlist representation learning, we present NetTAG, a netlist foundation model that fuses gate semantics with graph structure, handling diverse gate types and supporting a variety of functional and physical tasks. Moving beyond existing graph-only methods, NetTAG formulates netlists as text-attributed graphs, with gates annotated by symbolic logic expressions and physical characteristics as text attributes. Its multimodal architecture combines an LLM-based text encoder for gate semantics and a graph transformer for global structure. Pre-trained with gate and graph self-supervised objectives and aligned with RTL and layout stages, NetTAG captures comprehensive circuit intrinsics. Experimental results show that NetTAG consistently outperforms each task-specific method on four largely different functional and physical tasks and surpasses state-of-the-art AIG encoders, demonstrating its versatility."
2504.09561,"In this paper, we propose LoopLynx, a scalable dataflow architecture for efficient LLM inference that optimizes FPGA usage through a hybrid spatial-temporal design.

Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval.

However, conventional vector architectures face certain constraints such as limited vector register sizes, reliance on power-of-two vector length multipliers, and vector permutation capabilities tied to specific architectures. To address these challenges, we have introduced an instruction set extension (ISE) based on RISC-V known as unlimited vector processing (UVP). This extension enhances both the flexibility and efficiency of vector computations. UVP employs a novel programming model that supports non-power-of-two register groupings and hardware strip-mining, thus enabling smooth handling of vectors of varying lengths while reducing the software strip-mining burden. Vector instructions are categorized into symmetric and asymmetric classes, complemented by specialized load/store strategies to optimize execution. Moreover, we present a hardware implementation of UVP featuring sophisticated hazard detection mechanisms, optimized pipelines for symmetric tasks such as fixed-point multiplication and division, and a robust permutation engine for effective asymmetric operations. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that UVP significantly enhances performance, achieving up to 3.0$\times$ and 2.1$\times$ speedups in matrix multiplication and fast Fourier transform (FFT) tasks, respectively, when measured against lane-based vector architectures.

2504.11421,"Multi-Processor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs) are highly vulnerable to thermal attacks that manipulate dynamic thermal management systems. To counter this, we propose an adaptive real-time monitoring mechanism that detects abnormal thermal patterns in chip tiles. Our design space exploration helped identify key thermal features for an efficient anomaly detection module to be implemented at routers of network-enabled MPSoCs. To minimize hardware overhead, we employ weighted moving average (WMA) calculations and bit-shift operations, ensuring a lightweight yet effective implementation. By defining a spectrum of abnormal behaviors, our system successfully detects and mitigates malicious temperature fluctuations, reducing severe cases from 3.00°C to 1.9°C. The anomaly detection module achieves up to 82% of accuracy in detecting thermal attacks, which is only 10-15% less than top-performing machine learning (ML) models like Random Forest. However, our approach reduces hardware usage by up to 75% for logic resources and 100% for specialized resources, making it significantly more efficient than ML-based solutions. This method provides a practical, low-cost solution for resource-constrained environments, ensuring resilience against thermal attacks while maintaining system performance."
2504.11574,"In technology mapping, the quality of the final implementation heavily relies on the circuit structure after technology-independent optimization. Recent studies have introduced equality saturation as a novel optimization approach. However, its efficiency remains a hurdle against its wide adoption in logic synthesis. This paper proposes a highly scalable and efficient framework named E-morphic. It is the first work that employs equality saturation for resynthesis after conventional technology-independent logic optimizations, enabling structure exploration before technology mapping. Powered by several key enhancements to the equality saturation framework, such as direct e-graph-circuit conversion, solution-space pruning, and simulated annealing for e-graph extraction, this approach not only improves the scalability and extraction efficiency of e-graph rewriting but also addresses the structural bias issue present in conventional logic synthesis flows through parallel structural exploration and resynthesis. Experiments show that, compared to the state-of-the-art delay optimization flow in ABC, E-morphic on average achieves 12.54% area saving and 7.29% delay reduction on the large-scale circuits in the EPFL benchmark."
2504.1197,"A delayed feedback reservoir (DFR) is a hardwarefriendly reservoir computing system. Implementing DFRs in embedded hardware requires efficient online training. However, two main challenges prevent this: hyperparameter selection, which is typically done by offline grid search, and training of the output linear layer, which is memory-intensive. This paper introduces a fast and accurate parameter optimization method for the reservoir layer utilizing backpropagation and gradient descent by adopting a modular DFR model. A truncated backpropagation strategy is proposed to reduce memory consumption associated with the expansion of the recursive structure while maintaining accuracy. The computation time is significantly reduced compared to grid search. Additionally, an in-place Ridge regression for the output layer via 1-D Cholesky decomposition is presented, reducing memory usage to be 1/4. These methods enable the realization of an online edge training and inference system of DFR on an FPGA, reducing computation time by about 1/13 and power consumption by about 1/27 compared to software implementation on the same board."

However, benchmarks and tooling to comprehensively evaluate LLMs for HLS design tasks remain scarce.To address this, we introduce HLS-Eval, the first complete benchmark and evaluation framework for LLM-driven HLS design. HLS-Eval targets two core tasks: (1) generating HLS code from natural language descriptions, and (2) performing HLS-specific code edits to optimize performance and hardware efficiency. The benchmark includes 94 unique designs drawn from standard HLS benchmarks and novel sources. Each case is prepared via a semi-automated flow that produces a natural language description and a paired testbench for C-simulation and synthesis validation, ensuring each task is ""LLM-ready.""Beyond the benchmark, HLS-Eval offers a modular Python framework for automated, parallel evaluation of both local and hosted LLMs. It includes a parallel evaluation engine, direct HLS tool integration, and abstractions for to support different LLM interaction paradigms, enabling rapid prototyping of new benchmarks, tasks, and LLM methods.We demonstrate HLS-Eval through baseline evaluations of open-source LLMs on Vitis HLS, measuring outputs across four key metrics - parseability, compilability, runnability, and synthesizability - reflecting the iterative HLS design cycle.

This paper proposes a scalable and efficient framework based on Mixed Structural Choices (MCH). This is a novel heterogeneous mapping method that combines multiple logic representations with technology-aware optimization. MCH flexibly integrates different logic representations and stores candidates for various optimization strategies. By comprehensively evaluating the technology costs of these candidates, it enhances technology mapping and addresses structural bias issues in logic synthesis. Notably, the MCH-based lookup table (LUT) mapping algorithm set new records in the EPFL Best Results Challenge by combining the structural strengths of both And-Inverter Graph (AIG) and XOR-Majority Graph (XMG) logic representations. Additionally, MCH-based ASIC technology mapping achieves a 3.73% area and 8.94% delay reduction (balanced), 20.35% delay reduction (delay-oriented), and 21.02% area reduction (area-oriented), outperforming traditional structural choice methods.

However, accurately quantizing LLM weights and activations to low precision is challenging without degrading model accuracy. We propose fine-grained mixed precision (FGMP) quantization, a post-training mixed-precision quantization hardware-software co-design methodology that maintains accuracy while quantizing the majority of weights and activations to reduced precision. Our work makes the following contributions: 1) We develop a policy that uses the perturbation in each value, weighted by the Fisher information, to select which weight and activation blocks to keep in higher precision. This approach preserves accuracy by identifying which weight and activation blocks need to be retained in higher precision to minimize the perturbation in the model loss. 2) We also propose a sensitivity-weighted clipping approach for fine-grained quantization which helps retain accuracy for blocks that are quantized to low precision. 3) We then propose hardware augmentations to leverage the efficiency benefits of FGMP quantization. Our hardware implementation encompasses i) datapath support for FGMP at block granularity, and ii) a mixed-precision activation quantization unit to assign activation blocks to high or low precision on the fly with minimal runtime and energy overhead. Our design, prototyped using NVFP4 (an FP4 format with microscaling) as the low-precision datatype and FP8 as the high-precision datatype, facilitates efficient FGMP quantization, attaining <1% perplexity degradation on Wikitext-103 for the Llama-2-7B model relative to an all-FP8 baseline design while consuming 14% less energy during inference and requiring 30% less weight memory."

Simultaneously, the vast amounts of short-lived data in these workloads make SRAM overprovisioned in retention capability. To address this mismatch, we propose a wholesale shift from uniform SRAM arrays to heterogeneous on-chip memory, incorporating denser short-term RAM (StRAM) devices whose limited retention times align with transient data lifetimes. To facilitate this shift, we introduce GainSight, the first comprehensive, open-source framework that aligns dynamic, fine-grained workload lifetime profiles with memory device characteristics to enable generation of optimal StRAM memory compositions. GainSight combines retargetable profiling backends with an architecture-agnostic analytical frontend. The various backends capture cycle-accurate data lifetimes, while the frontend correlates workload patterns with StRAM retention properties to generate optimal memory compositions and project performance. GainSight elevates data lifetime to a first-class design consideration for next-generation AI accelerators, enabling systematic exploitation of data transience for improved on-chip memory density and efficiency. Applying GainSight to MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads reveals that 64.3% of first-level GPU cache accesses and 79.01% of systolic array scratchpad accesses exhibit sub-microsecond lifetimes suitable for high-density StRAM, with optimal heterogeneous on-chip memory compositions achieving up to 3x active energy and 4x area reductions compared to uniform SRAM hierarchies.

However, due to its huge model size and runtime increase of the memory footprint, LLM inferences suffer from the lack of memory capacity in conventional systems consisting of multiple GPUs with a modest amount of high bandwidth memory. Moreover, since LLM contains many bandwidthintensive kernels, only focusing on the memory capacity without considering the bandwidth incurs a serious performance degradation. To handle such conflicting memory capacity and bandwidth demands in a cost-effective way, this study investigates the potential of heterogeneous memory systems, proposing H2M2. It uses an asymmetric memory architecture consisting of capacity-centric and bandwidthcentric memory with computation units attached to each memory device. With the asymmetric memory, we first analyze the effect of kernel-memory mapping for the asymmetric memory. Second, we propose a dynamic runtime algorithm that finds a mapping solution considering the characteristics of LLM operations and the change of footprint during LLM inference. Third, we advocate the need for memory abstraction for the efficient management of the asymmetric memory. H2M2 outperforms the conventional homogeneous memory system with LPDDR by 1.46x, 1.55x, and 2.94x speedup in GPT3-175B, Chinchilla-70B, and Llama2-70B, respectively."

Second, existing HLS tools are outdated because they predominantly target individual accelerator designs and lack an architecture-oriented perspective to support common hardware module extraction and reuse, limiting their adaptability and broader applicability. Motivated by these two limitations, we propose ForgeBench, an ML-focused benchmark suite with a hardware design auto-generation framework for next-generation HLS tools.

We present VERICODER, a model for RTL code generation fine-tuned on a dataset validated for functional correctness. This fine-tuning dataset is constructed using a novel methodology that combines unit test generation with feedback-directed refinement. Given a natural language specification and an initial RTL design, we prompt a teacher model (GPT-4o-mini) to generate unit tests and iteratively revise the RTL design based on its simulation results using the generated tests. If necessary, the teacher model also updates the tests to ensure they comply with the natural language specification. As a result of this process, every example in our dataset is functionally validated, consisting of a natural language description, an RTL implementation, and passing tests. Fine-tuned on this dataset of 125,777 examples, VERICODER achieves state-of-the-art metrics in functional correctness on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with relative gains of up to 71.7% and 27.4%, respectively.

2504.15721,"Large language models (LLMs), with their billions of parameters, pose substantial challenges for deployment on edge devices, straining both memory capacity and computational resources. Block Floating Point (BFP) quantisation reduces memory and computational overhead by converting high-overhead floating point operations into low-bit fixed point operations. However, BFP requires aligning all data to the maximum exponent, which causes loss of small and moderate values, resulting in quantisation error and degradation in the accuracy of LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Bidirectional Block Floating Point (BBFP) data format, which reduces the probability of selecting the maximum as shared exponent, thereby reducing quantisation error. By utilizing the features in BBFP, we present a full-stack Bidirectional Block Floating Point-Based Quantisation Accelerator for LLMs (BBAL), primarily comprising a processing element array based on BBFP, paired with proposed cost-effective nonlinear computation unit.

The main obstacle in using LLMs for Verilog code generation is the lack of sufficient functional verification data, particularly testbenches paired with design specifications and code. To address this problem, we introduce an automatic testbench generation pipeline that decomposes the process and uses feedback from the Verilog compiler simulator (VCS) to reduce hallucination and ensure correctness. We then use the testbench to evaluate the generated codes and collect them for further training, where verification insights are introduced. Our method applies reinforcement learning (RL), specifically direct preference optimization (DPO), to align Verilog code generation with functional correctness by training preference pairs based on testbench outcomes. In evaluations on VerilogEval-Machine, VerilogEval-Human, RTLLM v1.1, RTLLM v2, and VerilogEval v2, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating functionally correct Verilog code.

A key metric for functional safety is achieving a sufficient fault coverage. To meet this requirement, extensive time-consuming fault simulation of the RTL code is necessary during the chip designthis http URLmain overhead in RTL fault simulation comes from simulating behavioral nodes (always blocks). Due to the limited fault propagation capacity, fault simulation results often match the good simulation results for many behavioral nodes. A key strategy for accelerating RTL fault simulation is the identification and elimination of redundant simulations. Existing methods detect redundant executions by examining whether the fault inputs to each RTL node are consistent with the good inputs. However, we observe that this input comparison mechanism overlooks a significant amount of implicit redundant execution: although the fault inputs differ from the good inputs, the node's execution results remain unchanged. Our experiments reveal that this overlooked redundant execution constitutes nearly half of the total execution overhead of behavioral nodes, becoming a significant bottleneck in current RTL fault simulation. The underlying reason for this overlooked redundancy is that, in these cases, the true execution paths within the behavioral nodes are not affected by the changes in input values. In this work, we propose a behavior-level redundancy detection algorithm that focuses on the true execution paths. Building on the elimination of redundant executions, we further developed an efficient RTL fault simulation framework,this http URLresults show that compared to commercial tools, under the same fault coverage, our framework achieves a 3.9 $\times$ improvement in simulation performance on average."

Although recent efforts have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate SystemVerilog Assertion (SVA) properties from design documents for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design verification, in our experience these approaches have not shown promise in generating SVA properties for communication protocols. Since protocol specification documents are unstructured and ambiguous in nature, LLMs often fail to extract the necessary information and end up generating irrelevant or even incorrect properties. We propose FLAG, a two-stage framework to help construct formal protocol specifications from informal documents. In the first stage, a predefined template set is used to generate candidate SVA properties. To avoid missing necessary properties, we develop a grammar-based approach to generate comprehensive template sets that capture critical signal behaviors for various communication protocols. In the second stage, we utilize unambiguous timing diagrams in conjunction with textual descriptions from the specification documents to filter out incorrect properties. A formal approach is first implemented to check the candidate properties and filter out those inconsistent with the timing diagrams. An LLM is then consulted to further remove incorrect properties with respect to the textual description, obtaining the final property set. Experiments on various open-source communication protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of FLAG in generating SVA properties from informal documents."

Additionally, we propose a hybrid execution strategy that intelligently offloads compute-intensive operations to the FPGA while utilizing the CPU for lighter tasks, effectively balancing the computational workload and maximizing overall performance. Our framework achieves a model compression rate of 55.08% compared to the original model and produces output at a rate of 5.1 tokens per second, outperforming the baseline performance of 2.8 tokens per second."
2504.17584,"Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly require processing long text sequences, but GPU memory limitations force difficult trade-offs between memory capacity and bandwidth. While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its capacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves capacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the critical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention (MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and high bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this operation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.Based on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software co-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three innovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and computational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference utilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data transfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler coordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices. Evaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch sizes."

Sparse systolic tensor arrays - specifically designed to accelerate these structured-sparse ML models - play a pivotal role in enabling efficient computations. As ML is increasingly integrated into safety-critical systems, it is of paramount importance to ensure the reliability of these systems. This paper introduces an online error-checking technique capable of detecting and locating permanent faults within sparse systolic tensor arrays before computation begins. The new technique relies on merely four test vectors and exploits the weight values already loaded within the systolic array to comprehensively test the system. Fault-injection campaigns within the gate-level netlist, while executing three well-established Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), validate the efficiency of the proposed approach, which is shown to achieve very high fault coverage, while incurring minimal performance and area overheads."

Edge training aims to leverage speed, energy efficiency and adaptability within the resource constraints of the nodes. Deploying and training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)-based models at the edge, although accurate, posit significant challenges from the back-propagation algorithm's complexity, bit precision trade-offs, and heterogeneity of DNN layers. This paper presents a Dynamic Tsetlin Machine (DTM) training accelerator as an alternative to DNN implementations.

2504.2068,"Computing with coupled oscillators or oscillatory neural networks (ONNs) has recently attracted a lot of interest due to their potential for massive parallelism and energy-efficient computing. However, to date, ONNs have primarily been explored either analytically or through analog circuit implementations. This paper shifts the focus to the digital implementation of ONNs, examining various design architectures. We first report on an existing digital ONN design based on a recurrent architecture. The major challenge for scaling such recurrent architectures is the quadratic increase in coupling hardware with the network size. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that balances serialization and parallelism in the coupling elements that shows near-linear hardware scaling, on the order of about 1.2 with the network size. Furthermore, we evaluate the benefits and costs of these different digital ONN architectures in terms time to solution and resource usage on FPGA emulation. The proposed hybrid architecture allows for a 10.5$\times$ increase in the number of oscillators while using 5-bits to represent the coupling weights and 4-bits to represent the oscillator phase on a Zynq-7020 FPGA board.

Hardware fuzzing testing techniques have recently shown promising results in discovering transient execution bugs in large-scale out-of-order processor designs. However, their poor microarchitectural controllability and observability prevent them from effectively and efficiently detecting transient execution vulnerabilities.This paper proposes DejaVuzz, a novel pre-silicon stage processor transient execution bug fuzzer. DejaVuzz utilizes two innovative operating primitives: dynamic swappable memory and differential information flow tracking, enabling more effective and efficient transient execution vulnerability detection. The dynamic swappable memory enables the isolation of different instruction streams within the same address space. Leveraging this capability, DejaVuzz generates targeted training for arbitrary transient windows and eliminates ineffective training, enabling efficient triggering of diverse transient windows. The differential information flow tracking aids in observing the propagation of sensitive data across the microarchitecture. Based on taints, DejaVuzz designs the taint coverage matrix to guide mutation and uses taint liveness annotations to identify exploitable leakages. Our evaluation shows that DejaVuzz outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzer SpecDoctor, triggering more comprehensive transient windows with lower training overhead and achieving a 4.7x coverage improvement.

While conventional physical design for 2.5D heterogeneous systems typically prioritizes wirelength reduction through tight chiplet packing, this strategy creates thermal bottlenecks and intensifies coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatches, compromising long-term reliability. Addressing these challenges requires holistic consideration of thermal performance, mechanical stress, and interconnect efficiency. We introduce STAMP-2.5D, the first automated floorplanning methodology that simultaneously optimizes these critical factors. Our approach employs finite element analysis to simulate temperature distributions and stress profiles across chiplet configurations while minimizing interconnect wirelength. Experimental results demonstrate that our thermal structural aware automated floorplanning approach reduces overall stress by 11% while maintaining excellent thermal performance with a negligible 0.5% temperature increase and simultaneously reducing total wirelength by 11% compared to temperature-only optimization.

The memory system, consisting of multiple technologies at different levels, is responsible for most of the energy consumption, performance bottlenecks, robustness problems, monetary cost, and hardware real estate of a modern computing system. All this becomes worse as modern and emerging applications become more data-intensive (as we readily witness in e.g., machine learning, genome analysis, graph processing, and data analytics), making the memory system an even larger bottleneck. In this paper, we discuss two major challenges that greatly affect computing system performance and efficiency: 1) memory technology & capacity scaling (at the lower device and circuit levels) and 2) system and application performance & energy scaling (at the higher levels of the computing stack). We demonstrate that both types of scaling have become extremely difficult, wasteful, and costly due to the dominant processor-centric design & execution paradigm of computers, which treats memory as a dumb and inactive component that cannot perform any computation. We show that moving to a memory-centric design & execution paradigm can solve the major challenges, while enabling multiple other potential benefits. In particular, we demonstrate that: 1) memory technology scaling problems (e.g., RowHammer, RowPress, Variable Read Disturbance, data retention, and other issues awaiting to be discovered) can be much more easily and efficiently handled by enabling memory to autonomously manage itself; 2) system and application performance & energy efficiency can, at the same time, be improved by orders of magnitude by enabling computation capability in memory chips and structures (i.e., processing in memory).

In recent years, AI-assisted IC design methods have demonstrated great potential, but most methods are task-specific or focus solely on the circuit structure in graph format, overlooking other circuit modalities with rich functional information. In this paper, we introduce CircuitFusion, the first multimodal and implementation-aware circuit encoder. It encodes circuits into general representations that support different downstream circuit design tasks. To learn from circuits, we propose to fuse three circuit modalities: hardware code, structural graph, and functionality summary. More importantly, we identify four unique properties of circuits: parallel execution, functional equivalent transformation, multiple design stages, and circuit reusability. Based on these properties, we propose new strategies for both the development and application of CircuitFusion: 1) During circuit preprocessing, utilizing the parallel nature of circuits, we split each circuit into multiple sub-circuits based on sequential-element boundaries, each sub-circuit in three modalities. 2) During CircuitFusion pre-training, we introduce three self-supervised tasks that utilize equivalent transformations both within and across modalities. 3) When applying CircuitFusion to downstream tasks, we propose a new retrieval-augmented inference method, which retrieves similar known circuits as a reference for predictions.

While recent advancements have automatically designed single-cycle processors that execute one instruction per cycle, their performance cannot compete with modern superscalar processors that execute multiple instructions per cycle. Previous methods fail on superscalar processor design because they cannot address inter-instruction data dependencies, leading to inefficient sequential instruction execution.This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically designing superscalar processors using a hardware-friendly model called the Stateful Binary Speculation Diagram (State-BSD). We observe that processor parallelism can be enhanced through on-the-fly inter-instruction dependent data predictors, reusing the processor's internal states to learn the data dependency. To meet the challenge of both hardware-resource limitation and design functional correctness, State-BSD consists of two components: 1) a lightweight state-selector trained by the simulated annealing method to detect the most reusable processor states and store them in a small buffer; and 2) a highly precise state-speculator trained by the BSD expansion method to predict the inter-instruction dependent data using the selected states. It is the first work to achieve the automated superscalar processor design, i.e. QiMeng-CPU-v2, which improves the performance by about $380\times$ than the state-of-the-art automated design and is comparable to human-designed superscalar processors such as ARM Cortex A53."

Today's reliance on a single dominant platform limits portability, creates vendor lock-in, and raises barriers for new AI hardware. In this work, we make the case for combining just-in-time (JIT) compilation with comprehensive kernel parameter autotuning to enable portable LLM inference with state-of-the-art performance without code changes. Focusing on performance-critical LLM kernels, we demonstrate that this approach explores up to 15x more kernel parameter configurations, produces significantly more diverse code across multiple dimensions, and even outperforms vendor-optimized implementations by up to 230%, all while reducing kernel code size by 70x and eliminating manual code optimizations. Our results highlight autotuning as a promising path to unlocking model portability across GPU vendors."

Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this approach, partially restoring the GPU's computational capabilities in artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. Performance evaluations using open-source GPU benchmarks (OpenCL benchmark, mixbench) and AI benchmarks (LLAMA-benchmark) reveal that its FP32 floating-point performance exceeds 15 times the original capability, while inference performance for certain precision levels in large language models surpasses threefold improvements.

2505.04108,"In hardware accelerators used in data centers and safety-critical applications, soft errors and resultant silent data corruption significantly compromise reliability, particularly when upsets occur in control-flow operations, leading to severe failures. To address this, we introduce two methods for monitoring control flows: using specification-derived Petri nets and using behavior-derived state transitions. We validated our method across four designs: convolutional layer operation, Gaussian blur, AES encryption, and a router in Network-on-Chip. Our fault injection campaign targeting the control registers and primary control inputs demonstrated high error detection rates in both datapath and control logic. Synthesis results show that a maximum detection rate is achieved with a few to around 10% area overhead in most cases. The proposed detectors quickly detect 48% to 100% of failures resulting from upsets in internal control registers and perturbations in primary control inputs. The two proposed methods were compared in terms of area overhead and error detection rate. By selectively applying these two methods, a wide range of area constraints can be accommodated, enabling practical implementation and effectively enhancing error detection capabilities."

It has important applications in numerous fields, such as social or biological network analysis and network security. TC is a memory-bound workload that does not scale efficiently in conventional processor-centric systems due to several memory accesses across large memory regions and low data reuse. However, recent Processing-in-Memory (PIM) architectures present a promising solution to alleviate these bottlenecks. Our work presents the first TC algorithm that leverages the capabilities of the UPMEM system, the first commercially available PIM architecture, while at the same time addressing its limitations. We use a vertex coloring technique to avoid expensive communication between PIM cores and employ reservoir sampling to address the limited amount of memory available in the PIM cores' DRAM banks. In addition, our work makes use of the Misra-Gries summary to speed up counting triangles on graphs with high-degree nodes and uniform sampling of the graph edges for quicker approximate results. Our PIM implementation surpasses state-of-the-art CPU-based TC implementations when processing dynamic graphs in Coordinate List format, showcasing the effectiveness of the UPMEM architecture in addressing TC's memory-bound challenges."
2505.04567,"This paper presents an automated approach for designing processors that support a subset of the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) for a new class of applications at Extreme Edge. The electronics used in extreme edge applications must be area and power-efficient, but also provide additional qualities, such as low cost, conformability, comfort and sustainability. Flexible electronics, rather than silicon-based electronics, will be able to meet the above qualities. For this purpose, we propose a methodology for generating RISC-V instruction subset processors (RISSPs) tailored to these applications and implementing them as flexible integrated circuits (FlexICs). The methodology makes verification an integral part of the processor design by treating each instruction in the ISA as a discrete, fully functional, pre-verified hardware block. It automatically builds a custom processor by stitching together the instruction hardware blocks required by an application or a set of applications in a specific domain. We generate RISSPs using the proposed methodology for three extreme edge applications, and embedded applications from the Embench benchmark suite. When synthesized, RISSPs can achieve 8-to-43% reduction in area and 3-to-30% reduction in power compared to a processor supporting the full RISC-V ISA, and are also on average ~40 times more energy efficient than Serv - the world's smallest 32-bit RISC-V processor. When physically implemented as FlexICs, the three extreme edge RISSPs achieve up to 42% area and 21% power savings with respect to the full RISC-V processor."
2505.05266,"Recently, practical analog in-memory computing has been realized using unmodified commercial DRAM modules. The underlying Processing-Using-DRAM (PUD) techniques enable high-throughput bitwise operations directly within DRAM arrays. However, the presence of inherent error-prone columns hinders PUD's practical adoption. While selectively using only error-free columns would ensure reliability, this approach significantly reduces PUD's computational throughput.This paper presents PUDTune, a novel high-precision calibration technique for increasing the number of error-free columns in PUD. PUDTune compensates for errors by applying pre-identified column-specific offsets to PUD operations. By leveraging multi-level charge states of DRAM cells, PUDTune generates fine-grained and wide-range offset variations despite the limited available rows. Our experiments with DDR4 DRAM demonstrate that PUDTune increases the number of error-free columns by 1.81$\times$ compared to conventional implementations, improving addition and multiplication throughput by 1.88$\times$ and 1.89$\times$ respectively."

Existing studies on 3D FPGAs are often constrained to fixed prototypes, narrow architectural templates, and simulation-only evaluations. In this work, we present LaZagna, the first open-source framework for automated, end-to-end 3D FPGA architecture generation and evaluation. LaZagna supports high-level architectural specification, synthesizable RTL generation, and bitstream production, enabling comprehensive validation of 3D FPGA designs beyond simulation. It significantly broadens the design space compared to prior work by introducing customizable vertical interconnect patterns, novel 3D switch block designs, and support for heterogeneous logic layers. The framework also incorporates practical design constraints such as inter-layer via density and vertical interconnect delay. We demonstrate the capabilities of LaZagna by generating synthesizable RTL that can be taken through full physical design flows for fabric generation, along with functionally correct bitstreams. Furthermore, we conduct five case studies that explore various architectural parameters and evaluate their impact on wirelength, critical path delay, and routing runtime.

This review surveys emerging photonic hardware optimized for next-generation generative AI computing. We discuss integrated photonic neural network architectures (e.g., Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes, lasers, wavelength-multiplexed microring resonators) that perform ultrafast matrix operations. We also examine promising alternative neuromorphic devices, including spiking neural network circuits and hybrid spintronic-photonic synapses, which combine memory and processing. The integration of two-dimensional materials (graphene, TMDCs) into silicon photonic platforms is reviewed for tunable modulators and on-chip synaptic elements. Transformer-based LLM architectures (self-attention and feed-forward layers) are analyzed in this context, identifying strategies and challenges for mapping dynamic matrix multiplications onto these novel hardware substrates. We then dissect the mechanisms of mainstream LLMs, such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and LLaMA, highlighting their architectural similarities and differences. We synthesize state-of-the-art components, algorithms, and integration methods, highlighting key advances and open issues in scaling such systems to mega-sized LLM models.

However, these models face significant scalability challenges, particularly when processing proteins with long amino acid sequences (e.g., sequence length > 1,000). The primary bottleneck that arises from the exponential growth in activation sizes is driven by the unique data structure in PPM, which introduces an additional dimension that leads to substantial memory and computational demands. These limitations have hindered the effective scaling of PPM for real-world applications, such as analyzing large proteins or complex multimers with critical biological and pharmaceutical relevance.In this paper, we present LightNobel, the first hardware-software co-designed accelerator developed to overcome scalability limitations on the sequence length in PPM. At the software level, we propose Token-wise Adaptive Activation Quantization (AAQ), which leverages unique token-wise characteristics, such as distogram patterns in PPM activations, to enable fine-grained quantization techniques without compromising accuracy. At the hardware level, LightNobel integrates the multi-precision reconfigurable matrix processing unit (RMPU) and versatile vector processing unit (VVPU) to enable the efficient execution of AAQ. Through these innovations, LightNobel achieves up to 8.44x, 8.41x speedup and 37.29x, 43.35x higher power efficiency over the latest NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs, respectively, while maintaining negligible accuracy loss.

As a result, a range of advanced NeRF models has emerged, leading on-device applications to increasingly adopt NeRF for highly realistic scene reconstructions. With the advent of diverse NeRF models, NeRF-based applications leverage a variety of NeRF frameworks, creating the need for hardware capable of efficiently supporting these models. However, GPUs fail to meet the performance, power, and area (PPA) cost demanded by these on-device applications, or are specialized for specific NeRF algorithms, resulting in lower efficiency when applied to other NeRF models. To address this limitation, in this work, we introduce FlexNeRFer, an energy-efficient versatile NeRF accelerator. The key components enabling the enhancement of FlexNeRFer include: i) a flexible network-on-chip (NoC) supporting multi-dataflow and sparsity on precision-scalable MAC array, and ii) efficient data storage using an optimal sparsity format based on the sparsity ratio and precision modes. To evaluate the effectiveness of FlexNeRFer, we performed a layout implementation using 28nm CMOS technology. Our evaluation shows that FlexNeRFer achieves 8.2~243.3x speedup and 24.1~520.3x improvement in energy efficiency over a GPU (i.e., NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti), while demonstrating 4.2~86.9x speedup and 2.3~47.5x improvement in energy efficiency compared to a state-of-the-art NeRF accelerator (i.e., NeuRex)."

Although many methods are proposed in prior works to improve multi-tenant performance, the impact of shared cache is not well studied. This paper proposes CaMDN, an architecture-scheduling co-design to enhance cache efficiency for multi-tenant DNNs on integrated NPUs. Specifically, a lightweight architecture is proposed to support model-exclusive, NPU-controlled regions inside shared cache to eliminate unexpected cache contention. Moreover, a cache scheduling method is proposed to improve shared cache utilization. In particular, it includes a cache-aware mapping method for adaptability to the varying available cache capacity and a dynamic allocation algorithm to adjust the usage among co-located DNNs at runtime. Compared to prior works, CaMDN reduces the memory access by 33.4% on average and achieves a model speedup of up to 2.56$\times$ (1.88$\times$ on average)."

PFAS are persistent in the environment and can bioaccumulate to ecological and human toxic levels. Computer designers have an opportunity to reduce the use of PFAS in semiconductors and electronics manufacturing, including integrated circuits (IC), batteries, displays, etc., which currently account for a staggering 10% of the total PFAS fluoropolymers usage in Europe alone. In this paper, we present a framework where we (1) quantify the environmental impact of PFAS in computing systems manufacturing with granular consideration of the metal layer stack and patterning complexities in IC manufacturing at the design phase, (2) identify contending trends between embodied carbon (carbon footprint due to hardware manufacturing) versus PFAS. For example, manufacturing an IC at a 7 nm technology node using EUV lithography uses 18% less PFAS-containing layers, compared to manufacturing the same IC at a 7 nm technology node using DUV immersion lithography (instead of EUV) unlike embodied carbon trends, and (3) conduct case studies to illustrate how to optimize and trade-off designs with lower PFAS, while meeting power-performance-area constraints. We show that optimizing designs to use less back-end-of-line (BEOL) metal stack layers can save 1.7$\times$ PFAS-containing layers in systolic arrays."

These processors have onchip logic like FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and thus can be configured to implement custom hardware functionality. The digital computing tasks that need to accelerate in hardware can be compiled down to a configuration file or bit stream that contains the information on how the logic components are configured and wired together. Video and image processing applications perform repeated pixel transformation and thus consume more power and the processing time. Software configurable processor best accelerates such compute intensive applications.

2505.06888,"In the ""Big Data"" era, a lot of data must be processed and moved between processing and memory units. New technologies and architectures have emerged to improve system performance and overcome the memory bottleneck. The memristor is a technology with both computing and memory capabilities. In-Memory Computing (IMC) can be performed by applying memristors to stateful design methods. The Fast and Energy-Efficient Logic in Memory (FELIX) logic is one of the stateful implementation logics compatible with memristive crossbar arrays. The way computations are performed can be changed to improve performance. Approximate design methods can be applied in error-resilient applications. In error-resilient applications, an acceptable amount of precision is lost while features such as hardware complexity, latency, and energy are improved. In this paper, using these two concepts, an approximate full adder circuit with exact Cout and approximate Sum outputs has been proposed using the FELIX design method for IMC in two different implementation approaches. The applied memristor count in the proposed FELIX-based Approximate Full Adder (FAFA) in the two proposed implementation approaches (FAFA1 and FAFA2) is improved by 14.28% and 28.57%, energy consumption is improved by 73.735% and 81.754%, respectively. The number of computational steps in both approaches is improved by 66.66% compared to the exact FELIX-based full adder. In this paper, two different scenarios are considered for evaluating the FAFA. In the 1st and 2nd scenarios, respectively, for the three and four Most Significant Bits (MSBs), the exact full adder is used, and for the five and four Least Significant Bits (LSBs), the FAFA is used. The results of error analysis and evaluations of the FAFA in three different image processing applications confirmed that FAFA has high accuracy and acceptable performance."

Quantization techniques have emerged as a critical solution, reducing data precision to enhance memory and computational efficiency. However, existing methods often suffer from high runtime overheads and potential accuracy degradation. To address these challenges, we propose Ecco, an entropy-based cache compression technique tailored for LLMs. Ecco combines group-wise and non-uniform quantization with pre-defined shared k-means patterns and Huffman coding to exploit the inherent entropy characteristics of LLM cache data. Recognizing the inefficiencies of traditional Huffman coding in terms of parallelism and latency, we introduce a novel parallel Huffman-based decoding process with a multi-stage pipeline design, reducing latency by two orders of magnitude and achieving throughput comparable to GPU L2 caches. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Ecco achieves an up to 2.9$\times$ and 1.9$\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art AWQ and SmoothQuant framework, 2.4$\times$ over the Olive accelerator, all while increasing memory capacity by nearly 4$\times$ and maintaining state-of-the-art LLM accuracy.

2505.07112,"RISC-V CPUs leverage the RVV (RISC-V Vector) extension to accelerate data-parallel workloads. In addition to arithmetic operations, RVV includes powerful permutation instructions that enable flexible element rearrangement within vector registers --critical for optimizing performance in tasks such as matrix operations and cryptographic computations. However, the diverse control mechanisms of these instructions complicate their execution within a unified datapath while maintaining the fixed-latency requirement of cryptographic accelerators. To address this, we propose a unified microarchitecture capable of executing all RVV permutation instructions efficiently, regardless of their control information structure. This approach minimizes area and hardware costs while ensuring single-cycle execution for short vector machines (up to 256 bits) and enabling efficient pipelining for longer vectors. The proposed design is integrated into an open-source RISC-V vector processor and implemented at 7 nm using the OpenRoad physical synthesis flow. Experimental results validate the efficiency of our unified vector permutation unit, demonstrating that it only incurs 1.5% area overhead to the total vector processor. Furthermore, this area overhead decreases to near-0% as the minimum supported element width for vector permutations increases."

However, it faces immense computational challenges arising from the excessive data volumes and algorithmic complexity.While state-of-the-art de novo assemblers utilize distributed systems for extreme-scale genome assembly, they demand substantial computational and memory resources. They also fail to address the inherent challenges of de novo assembly, including a large memory footprint, memory-bound behavior, and irregular data patterns stemming from complex, interdependent data structures. Given these challenges, de novo assembly merits a custom hardware solution, though existing approaches have not fully addressed the limitations.We propose NMP-PaK, a hardware-software co-design that accelerates scalable de novo genome assembly through near-memory processing (NMP). Our channel-level NMP architecture addresses memory bottlenecks while providing sufficient scratchpad space for processing elements. Customized processing elements maximize parallelism while efficiently handling large data structures that are both dynamic and interdependent.

Moreover, NMP-PaK delivers a 16X performance improvement over the CPU baseline, with a 2.4X reduction in memory operations. Consequently, NMP-PaK achieves 8.3X greater throughput than state-of-the-art de novo assembly under the same resource constraints, showcasing its superior computational efficiency."
2505.08191,"Neural rendering has gained prominence for its high-quality output, which is crucial for AR/VR applications. However, its large voxel grid data size and irregular access patterns challenge real-time processing on edge devices. While previous works have focused on improving data locality, they have not adequately addressed the issue of large voxel grid sizes, which necessitate frequent off-chip memory access and substantial on-chip memory. This paper introduces SpNeRF, a software-hardware co-design solution tailored for sparse volumetric neural rendering. We first identify memory-bound rendering inefficiencies and analyze the inherent sparsity in the voxel grid data of neural rendering. To enhance efficiency, we propose novel preprocessing and online decoding steps, reducing the memory size for voxel grid. The preprocessing step employs hash mapping to support irregular data access while maintaining a minimal memory size. The online decoding step enables efficient on-chip sparse voxel grid processing, incorporating bitmap masking to mitigate PSNR loss caused by hash collisions. To further optimize performance, we design a dedicated hardware architecture supporting our sparse voxel grid processing technique. Experimental results demonstrate that SpNeRF achieves an average 21.07$\times$ reduction in memory size while maintaining comparable PSNR levels.

2505.08421,"Graphics processing units (GPUs) excel at parallel processing, but remain largely unexplored in ultra-low-power edge devices (TinyAI) due to their power and area limitations, as well as the lack of suitable programming frameworks. To address these challenges, this work introduces embedded GPU (e-GPU), an open-source and configurable RISC-V GPU platform designed for TinyAI devices. Its extensive configurability enables area and power optimization, while a dedicated Tiny-OpenCL implementation provides a lightweight programming framework tailored to resource-constrained environments. To demonstrate its adaptability in real-world scenarios, we integrate the e-GPU with the eXtendible Heterogeneous Energy-Efficient Platform (X-HEEP) to realize an accelerated processing unit (APU) for TinyAI applications. Multiple instances of the proposed system, featuring varying e-GPU configurations, are implemented in TSMC's 16 nm SVT CMOS technology and are operated at 300 MHz and 0.8 V. Their area and leakage characteristics are analyzed to ensure alignment with TinyAI constraints. To assess both runtime overheads and application-level efficiency, we employ two benchmarks: General Matrix Multiply (GeMM) and bio-signal processing (TinyBio) workloads. The GeMM benchmark is used to quantify the scheduling overhead introduced by the Tiny-OpenCL framework. The results show that the delay becomes negligible for matrix sizes larger than 256x256 (or equivalent problem sizes). The TinyBio benchmark is then used to evaluate performance and energy improvements in the baseline host. The results demonstrate that the high-range e-GPU configuration with 16 threads achieves up to a 15.1x speed-up and reduces energy consumption by up to 3.1x, while incurring only a 2.5x area overhead and operating within a 28 mW power budget."
2505.08541,"Memory safety is a critical concern for modern embedded systems, particularly in security-sensitive applications. This paper explores the area impact of adding memory safety extensions to the Ibex RISC-V core, focusing on physical memory protection (PMP) and Capability Hardware Extension to RISC-V for Internet of Things (CHERIoT). We synthesise the extended Ibex cores using a commercial tool targeting the open FreePDK45 process and provide a detailed area breakdown and discussion of the results.The PMP configuration we consider is one with 16 PMP regions. We find that the extensions increase the core size by 24 thousand gate-equivalent (kGE) for PMP and 33 kGE for CHERIoT. The increase is mainly due to the additional state required to store information about protected memory. While this increase amounts to 42% for PMP and 57% for CHERIoT in Ibex's area, its effect on the overall system is minimal. In a complete system-on-chip (SoC), like the secure microcontroller OpenTitan Earl Grey, where the core represents only a fraction of the total area, the estimated system-wide overhead is 0.6% for PMP and 1% for CHERIoT. Given the security benefits these extensions provide, the area trade-off is justified, making Ibex a compelling choice for secure embedded applications."

This paper addresses this challenge through a software-hardware co-design framework, ITERA-LLM, which integrates sub-8-bit quantization with SVD-based iterative low-rank tensor decomposition for error compensation, leading to higher compression ratios and reduced computational complexity. The proposed approach is complemented by a hardware-aware Design Space Exploration (DSE) process that optimizes accuracy, latency, and resource utilization, tailoring the configuration to the specific requirements of the targeted LLM. Our results show that ITERA-LLM achieves linear layer latency reduction of up to 41.1%, compared to quantization-only baseline approach while maintaining similar model accuracy."

This survey provides a comprehensive review of two key architectural decisions for FPGA-based neural network accelerators: (i) the dataflow (the order and manner in which data is moved and reused on chip), and (ii) the tiling/blocking strategy (how large tensors are partitioned to fit on-chip). We first present a broadened taxonomy of canonical dataflow styles: Weight-Stationary, Output-Stationary, Row-Stationary, and No-Local-Reuse, including formal definitions, pseudocode/diagrams, and real FPGA examples. We then discuss analytical frameworks (MAESTRO, Timeloop) and compare them with a concise feature table, illustrating how they model reuse, performance, and hardware costs, and include a case study of a 3x3 convolution layer to demonstrate typical tool outputs. Next, we detail multi-level tiling and loop unrolling/pipelining strategies for FPGAs, clarifying how each memory tier (registers, LUTRAM, BRAM, HBM) can be exploited. Our four case studies - FINN, FINN-R, FlightLLM, and SSR - highlight distinct dataflows (from binary streaming to hybrid sparse transformations) and tiling patterns. We include a unified comparison matrix covering platform, precision, throughput, resource utilization, and energy efficiency, plus small block diagrams for each design.

To tackle the high-dimensional sizing problem, we propose a dual optimization scheme. The system-level optimization iteratively partitions the overall requirements and analytically maps them to subcircuit design specifications, while local optimization loops determines the subcircuits' design parameters. The dependency graph-based framework serializes the simulations for verification, knowledge-based calculations, and transistor sizing optimization in topological order, which eliminates the need for human intervention.

LLMs and their use in Verilog design has received significant attention due to the higher popularity of the language, but little attention so far has been given to VHDL despite its continued popularity in the industry. There has also been little discussion about the unique needs of organizations that engage in high-performance processor design, and techniques to deploy AI solutions in these settings. In this paper, we describe our journey in developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically for the purpose of explaining VHDL code, a task that has particular importance in an organization with decades of experience and assets in high-performance processor design. We show how we developed test sets specific to our needs and used them for evaluating models as we performed extended pretraining (EPT) of a base LLM. Expert evaluation of the code explanations produced by the EPT model increased to 69% compared to a base model rating of 43%. We further show how we developed an LLM-as-a-judge to gauge models similar to expert evaluators. This led us to deriving and evaluating a host of new models, including an instruction-tuned version of the EPT model with an expected expert evaluator rating of 71%. Our experiments also indicate that with the potential use of newer base models, this rating can be pushed to 85% and beyond. We conclude with a discussion on further improving the quality of hardware design LLMs using exciting new developments in the Generative AI world."
2505.1006,"End-to-end open-source electronic design automation (OSEDA) enables a collaborative approach to chip design conducive to supply chain diversification and zero-trust step-by-step design verification. However, existing end-to-end OSEDA flows have mostly been demonstrated on small designs and have not yet enabled large, industry-grade chips such as Linux-capable systems-on-chip (SoCs). This work presents Basilisk, the largest end-to-end open-source SoC to date. Basilisk's 34 mm2, 2.7 MGE design features a 64-bit Linux-capable RISC-V core, a lightweight 124 MB/s DRAM controller, and extensive IO, including a USB 1.1 host, a video output, and a fully digital 62 Mb/s chip-to-chip (C2C) link. We implement Basilisk in IHP's open 130 nm BiCMOS technology, significantly improving on the state-of-the-art (SoA) OSEDA flow. Our enhancements of the Yosys-based synthesis flow improve design timing and area by 2.3x and 1.6x, respectively, while consuming significantly less system resources. By tuning OpenROAD place and route (P&R) to our design and technology, we decrease the die size by 12%. The fabricated Basilisk chip reaches 62 MHz at its nominal 1.2 V core voltage and up to 102 MHz at 1.64 V. It achieves a peak energy efficiency of 18.9 DP MFLOP/s/W at 0.88 V."

While existing SNN accelerators exploit this sparsity to skip zero computations, they often overlook the unique distribution patterns inherent in binary activations. In this work, we observe that particular patterns exist in spike activations, which we can utilize to reduce the substantial computation of SNN models. Based on these findings, we propose a novel \textbf{pattern-based hierarchical sparsity} framework, termed \textbf{\textit{Phi}}, to optimize computation.\textit{Phi} introduces a two-level sparsity hierarchy: Level 1 exhibits vector-wise sparsity by representing activations with pre-defined patterns, allowing for offline pre-computation with weights and significantly reducing most runtime computation. Level 2 features element-wise sparsity by complementing the Level 1 matrix, using a highly sparse matrix to further reduce computation while maintaining accuracy. We present an algorithm-hardware co-design approach.

2505.11525,"Software configurable processors (SCP) implement compute intensive applications very efficiently on the special onchip configurable hardware. The SCP by Stretch Inc. converts the computeheavy algorithms into custom instructions, called extension instructions (EI) which run on the onchip logic. The Processor interleaves the EI's between regular instructions and the onchip hardware executes the algorithm in parallel, accelerating the application. This results in a performance gain of more than order of magnitude over an unaccelerated processor. This paper explains the implementation of two compute intensive algorithms on Stretch SCP, namely (i) colour space conversion and (ii) histogram equalisation. The repeated processing required by these algorithms is made easier by the SCP which allows packing of multiple pixels into a vector. The vector processing makes SCP achieve high throughput.

2505.11928,"The moduli of the form 2n + 1 belong to a class of low-cost odd moduli, which have been frequently selected to form the basis of various residue number systems (RNS). The most efficient computations modulo (mod) 2n + 1 are performed using the so-called diminished-1 (D1) representation. Therefore, it is desirable that the input converter from the positional number system to RNS (composed of a set of residue generators) could generate the residues mod 2n + 1 in D1 form. In this paper, we propose the basic architecture of the residue generator mod 2n + 1 with D1 output. It is universal, because its initial part can be easily designed for an arbitrary p >= 4n, whereas its final block-the 4-operand adder mod 2n + 1-preserves the same structure for any p. If a pair of conjugate moduli 2n +/- 1 belongs to the RNS moduli set, the latter architecture can be easily extended to build p-input bi-residue generators mod 2n+/-1, which not only save hardware by sharing p - 4n full-adders, but also generate the residue mod 2n + 1 directly in D1 form."
2505.12036,"Efficient network packet processing increasingly demands dynamic, adaptive, and run-time resizable match table allocation to handle the diverse and heterogeneous nature of traffic patterns and rule sets. Achieving this flexibility at high performance in hardware is challenging, as fixed resource constraints and architectural limitations have traditionally restricted such adaptability. In this paper, we introduce Synapse, an extension to programmable data plane architectures that incorporates the Virtual Matching Table (VMT) framework, drawing inspiration from virtual memory systems in Operating Systems (OSs), but specifically tailored to network processing. This abstraction layer allows logical tables to be elastic, enabling dynamic and efficient match table allocation at runtime. Our design features a hybrid memory system, leveraging on-chip associative memories for fast matching of the most popular rules and off-chip addressable memory for scalable and cost-effective storage. Furthermore, by employing a sharding mechanism across physical match tables, Synapse ensures that the power required per key match remains bounded and proportional to the key distribution and the size of the involved shard. To address the challenge of dynamic allocation, we formulate and solve an optimization problem that dynamically allocates physical match tables to logical tables based on pipeline usage and traffic characteristics at the millisecond scale. We prototype our design on FPGA and develop a simulator to evaluate the performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability."

Combining LLM with design space exploration (DSE), our explorer coordinates four agents: Router, Specialists, Arbitrator, and Critic. These multi-agent components interact with various tools to accelerate the optimization process. LLM-DSE leverages essential domain knowledge to identify efficient parameter combinations while maintaining adaptability through verbal learning from online interactions. Evaluations on the HLSyn dataset demonstrate that LLM-DSE achieves substantial $2.55\times$ performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, uncovering novel designs while reducing runtime.

However, existing hardware accelerators lack support for spiking attention, exhibit limited throughput in exploiting fine-grained sparsity, and struggle with scalable parallelism in sparse computation. To address these, we propose FireFly-T, a dual-engine overlay architecture that integrates a sparse engine for activation sparsity and a binary engine for spiking attention. In the sparse engine, we propose a highthroughput sparse decoder that exploits fine-grained sparsity by concurrently extracting multiple non-zero spikes. To complement this, we introduce a scalable load balancing mechanism with weight dispatch and out-of-order execution, eliminating bank conflicts to support scalable multidimensional parallelism. In the binary engine, we leverage the byte-level write capability of SRAMs to efficiently manipulate the 3D dataflows required for spiking attention with minimal resource overhead. We also optimize the core AND-PopCount operation in spiking attention through a LUT6-based implementation, improving timing closure and reducing LUT utilization on Xilinx FPGAs. As an overlay architecture, FireFly-T further incorporates an orchestrator that dynamically manipulates input dataflows with flexible adaptation for diverse network topologies, while ensuring efficient resource utilization and maintaining high throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that our accelerator achieves $1.39\times$ and $2.40\times$ higher energy efficiency, as well as $4.21\times$ and $7.10\times$ greater DSP efficiency, compared to FireFly v2 and the transformer-enabled SpikeTA, respectively.

2505.12856,"As the size of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models and datasets grows, the memory bandwidth becomes a critical bottleneck. The paper presents a novel extended memory hierarchy that addresses some major memory bandwidth challenges in data-parallel AI/ML applications. While data-parallel architectures like GPUs and neural network accelerators have improved power performance compared to traditional CPUs, they can still be significantly bottlenecked by their memory bandwidth, especially when the data reuse in the loop kernels is limited. Systolic arrays (SAs) and GPUs attempt to mitigate the memory bandwidth bottleneck but can still become memory bandwidth throttled when the amount of data reuse is not sufficient to confine data access mostly to the local memories near to the processing. To mitigate this, the proposed architecture introduces three levels of on-chip memory -- local, intermediate, and global -- with an ultra-wide register and data-shufflers to improve versatility and adaptivity to varying data-parallel applications. The paper explains the innovations at a conceptual level and presents a detailed description of the architecture innovations. We also map a representative data-parallel application, like a convolutional neural network (CNN), to the proposed architecture and quantify the benefits vis-a-vis GPUs and repersentative accelerators based on systolic arrays and vector processors."

Microscaling (MX) standardized formats have recently emerged as a promising alternative to baseline low-bitwidth FP formats, offering improved accuracy with a block-wise shared exponent scale combined with per-element values. However, efficiently executing the key linear algebra primitives for AI applications on MX formats requires specialized hardware support for the fundamental operators such as scaled dot product. In this work, we propose MXDOTP, the first RISC-V ISA extension for MX dot products, focusing on the 8-bit MXFP8 FP format. We extend the open-source Snitch RISC-V core with a dedicated MXFP8 dot product-accumulate unit, which fully consumes blocks of eight 8-bit operands packed into 64-bit inputs. To feed MXDOTP at full utilization with four operands per cycle, including block scales, we exploit Snitch's Stream Semantic Registers (SSRs), achieving up to 80% utilization with minimal impact on the Snitch core's architecture and no modification to the register file. Implemented in 12 nm FinFET, a cluster with eight MXDOTP-extended cores reaches up to 356 GFLOPS/W when computing MXFP8 matrix multiplications at 0.8 V, 1 GHz.

Autotuning has emerged as an effective approach for systematically evaluating variations of implementations. Traditionally, autotuning requires the workloads to be executed on the target hardware (HW). We present an interface that allows executing autotuning workloads on simulators. This approach offers high scalability when the availability of the target HW is limited, as many simulations can be run in parallel on any accessible HW. Additionally, we evaluate the feasibility of using fast instruction-accurate simulators for autotuning. We train various predictors to forecast the performance of ML workload implementations on the target HW based on simulation statistics. Our results demonstrate that the tuned predictors are highly effective. The best workload implementation in terms of actual run time on the target HW is always within the top 3 % of predictions for the tested x86, ARM, and RISC-V-based architectures. In the best case, this approach outperforms native execution on the target HW for embedded architectures when running as few as three samples on three simulators in parallel."

Computing these primitives is necessary for secure communication; thus, dedicated hardware accelerators are required in resource and latency-constrained environments. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) generates hardware from high-level implementations in languages like C, enabling the rapid prototyping and evaluation of designs, leading to its prominent use in developing dedicated hardware accelerators. However, directly synthesizing the straight-line C implementations of cryptographic primitives can lead to large hardware designs with excessive resource usage or suboptimal performance.We introduce Cryptonite, a tool that automatically generates efficient, synthesizable, and correct-by-design hardware accelerators for cryptographic primitives directly from straight-line C code. Cryptonite first identifies high-level hardware constructs through verified rewriting, emphasizing resource reuse. The second stage automatically explores latency-oriented implementations of the compact design. This enables the flexible scaling of a particular accelerator to meet the hardware requirements. We demonstrate Cryptonite's effectiveness using implementations from the Fiat Cryptography project, a library of verified and auto-generated cryptographic primitives for elliptic-curve cryptography. Our results show that Cryptonite achieves scalable designs with up to 88.88\% reduced resource usage and a 54.31\% improvement in latency compared to naively synthesized designs."
2505.14902,"Quantum computing imposes stringent requirements for the precise control of large-scale qubit systems, including, for example, microsecond-latency feedback and nanosecond-precision timing of gigahertz signals -- demands that far exceed the capabilities of conventional real-time systems. The rapidly evolving and highly diverse nature of quantum control necessitates the development of specialized hardware accelerators. While a few custom real-time systems have been developed to meet the tight timing constraints of specific quantum platforms, they face major challenges in scaling and adapting to increasingly complex control demands -- largely due to fragmented toolchains and limited support for design automation.To address these limitations, we present RISC-Q -- an open-source flexible generator for Quantum Control System-on-Chip (QCSoC) designs, featuring a programming interface compatible with the RISC-V ecosystem. Developed using SpinalHDL, RISC-Q enables efficient automation of highly parameterized and modular QCSoC architectures, supporting agile and iterative development to meet the evolving demands of quantum control.

2505.15271,"The increasing number of rectilinear floorplans in modern chip designs presents significant challenges for traditional macro placers due to the additional complexity introduced by blocked corners. Particularly, the widely adopted wirelength model Half-Perimeter Wirelength (HPWL) struggles to accurately handle rectilinear boundaries, highlighting the need for additional objectives tailored to rectilinear floorplan optimization. In this paper, we identify the necessity for whitespace diagnosis in rectilinear floorplanning, an aspect often overlooked in past research. We introduce WISP, a novel framework that analyzes and scores whitespace regions to guide placement optimization. WISP leverages image segmentation techniques for whitespace parsing, a lightweight probabilistic model to score whitespace regions based on macro distribution, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for whitespace density scoring and direction-aware macro relocation to iteratively refine macro placement, reduce wasted whitespace, and enhance design quality. The proposed diagnostic technique also enables the reclamation of block-level unused area and its return to the top level, maximizing overall area utilization. When compared against state-of-the-art academia placer DREAMPlace 4.1, our method achieves an average improvement of 5.4% in routing wirelength, with a maximum of 11.4% across widely-used benchmarks. This yields an average of 41.5% and 43.7% improvement in Worst Negative Slack (WNS) and Total Negative Slack (TNS), respectively.

However, the extended functionality and increased connectivity introduce new security risks and vulnerabilities that can be exploited on legacy automotive networks such as the controller area network (CAN). With the rising complexity of vehicular systems and attack vectors, the need for a flexible hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test fixture that can inject attacks and validate the performance of countermeasures in near-real-world conditions in real time is vital. This paper presents an FPGA-based HIL framework tailored towards validating network security approaches (IDS, IPS) and smart integration strategies of such capabilities for an automotive CAN bus. FAV-NSS replicates an actual vehicular system environment with functional ECUs and network infrastructure on an FPGA, allowing functional validation of IDS/IPS algorithms, accelerator designs and integration schemes (software task on ECU, dedicated accelerator). To show the efficacy of FAV-NSS, we evaluate an IDS accelerator integration problem, both as a traditional coupled accelerator (to the ECU), and secondly close to the CAN controller (mimicking an extended CAN controller). We show that the latter strategy can be fully validated by our framework, which would otherwise require integration of specialised CAN modules into otherwise standard HIL fixtures with ability to instrument internal signals for characterising timing performance. The tests demonstrate a promising latency reduction of 6.3x when compared to the traditional coupled accelerator. Our case study demonstrates the potential of FAV-NSS for accelerating the optimisation, integration and verification of smart ECUs and communication controllers in current and future vehicular systems."

2505.16445,"Dataflow is a critical yet underexplored factor in automatic macro placement, which is becoming increasingly important for developing intelligent design automation techniques that minimize reliance on manual adjustments and reduce design iterations. Existing macro or mixed-size placers with dataflow awareness primarily focus on intrinsic relationships among macros, overlooking the crucial influence of standard cell clusters on macro placement. To address this, we propose DAS-MP, which extracts hidden connections between macros and standard cells and incorporates a series of algorithms to enhance dataflow awareness, integrating them into placement constraints for improved macro placement. To further optimize placement results, we introduce two fine-tuning steps: (1) congestion optimization by taking macro area into consideration, and (2) flipping decisions to determine the optimal macro orientation based on the extracted dataflow information. By integrating enhanced dataflow awareness into placement constraints and applying these fine-tuning steps, the proposed approach achieves an average 7.9% improvement in half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) across multiple widely used benchmark designs compared to a state-of-the-art dataflow-aware macro placer. Additionally, it significantly improves congestion, reducing overflow by an average of 82.5%, and achieves improvements of 36.97% in Worst Negative Slack (WNS) and 59.44% in Total Negative Slack (TNS). The approach also maintains efficient runtime throughout the entire placement process, incurring less than a 1.5% runtime overhead.

However, the size of key-value cache (KV cache) is unpredictable and can even be tens of times larger than the weights in the long context length scenario. In this work, we propose Titanus, a software-hardware co-design to efficiently compress the KV cache on-the-fly. We first propose the cascade pruning-quantization (CPQ) method to reduce the KV cache movement. The hierarchical quantization extension strategy is introduced to tackle the non-independent per-channel quantization issue. To further reduce KV cache movement, we transfer only the non-zero KV cache between the accelerator and off-chip memory. Moreover, we customize a two-stage design space exploration framework for the CPQ method. A novel pipeline and parallelism dataflow is designed to reduce the first token generation time. Experiments show that Titanus achieves 159.9x (49.6x) and 34.8x (29.2x) energy efficiency (throughput) compared to Nvidia A100 GPU and FlightLLM respectively.

2505.18554,"Modern CPUs suffer from the frontend bottleneck because the instruction footprint of server workloads exceeds the private cache capacity. Prior works have examined the CPU components or private cache to improve the instruction hit rate. The large footprint leads to significant cache misses not only in the core and faster-level cache but also in the last-level cache (LLC). We observe that even with an advanced branch predictor and instruction prefetching techniques, a considerable amount of instruction accesses descend to the LLC. However, state-of-the-art LLC designs with elaborate data management overlook handling the instruction misses that precede corresponding data accesses. Specifically, when an instruction requiring numerous data accesses is missed, the frontend of a CPU should wait for the instruction fetch, regardless of how much data are present in the LLC.To preserve hot instructions in the LLC, we propose Garibaldi, a novel pairwise instruction-data management scheme. Garibaldi tracks the hotness of instruction accesses by coupling it with that of data accesses and adopts management techniques. On the one hand, this scheme includes a selective protection mechanism that prevents the cache evictions of high-cost instruction cachelines. On the other hand, in the case of unprotected instruction line misses, Garibaldi conservatively issues prefetch requests of the paired data lines while handling those misses. In our experiments, we evaluate Garibaldi with 16 server workloads on a 40-core machine. We also implement Garibaldi on top of a modern LLC design, including Mockingjay. Garibaldi improves 13.2% and 6.1% of CPU performance on baseline LLC design and Mockingjay, respectively."

2505.18824,"Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a critical computational kernel in transformer-based AI models. Emerging scalable tile-based accelerator architectures integrate increasing numbers of tightly-packed processing elements (PEs) with tensor units. MHA dataflow mapping is crucial for achieving high utilization of the available units. We propose FlatAttention, a new dataflow for MHA on tile-based many-PE accelerators, minimizing costly main memory (HBM) accesses by leveraging collective primitives integrated into the on-chip network fabric. FlatAttention achieves up to 89.3% utilization, and 4.1x performance speedup over FlashAttention-3 dataflow on tile-based accelerators whilst reducing HBM traffic by 16x. Through algorithm-architecture co-exploration, we identify an optimal configuration for a large scaled-out tile-based accelerator featuring a 32x32 tile mesh with 1024 TFLOPS @ FP16 peak performance, comparable to the state-of-the-art Nvidia H100 GPU. FlatAttention in this configuration achieves up to 1.3x higher utilization over FlashAttention-3 on the H100 GPU. Meanwhile, this tile-based accelerator configuration requires 40% less HBM bandwidth compared to the H100, enabling a 1.8x reduction in die size, estimated on the same technology node."
2505.18954,"Processing-in-memory (PIM) is a transformative architectural paradigm designed to overcome the Von Neumann bottleneck. Among PIM architectures, digital SRAM-PIM emerges as a promising solution, offering significant advantages by directly integrating digital logic within the SRAM array. However, rigid crossbar architecture and full array activation pose challenges in efficiently utilizing traditional value-level sparsity. Moreover, neural network models exhibit a high proportion of zero bits within non-zero values, which remain underutilized due to architectural constraints. To overcome these limitations, we present Dyadic Block PIM (DB-PIM), a groundbreaking algorithm-architecture co-design framework to harness both value-level and bit-level sparsity. At the algorithm level, our hybrid-grained pruning technique, combined with a novel sparsity pattern, enables effective sparsity management. Architecturally, DB-PIM incorporates a sparse network and customized digital SRAM-PIM macros, including input pre-processing unit (IPU), dyadic block multiply units (DBMUs), and Canonical Signed Digit (CSD)-based adder trees. It circumvents structured zero values in weights and bypasses unstructured zero bits within non-zero weights and block-wise all-zero bit columns in input features. As a result, the DB-PIM framework skips a majority of unnecessary computations, thereby driving significant gains in computational efficiency. Results demonstrate that our DB-PIM framework achieves up to 8.01x speedup and 85.28% energy savings, significantly boosting computational efficiency in digital SRAM-PIM systems."
2505.18975,"State Space Models (SSMs), like recent Mamba2, have achieved remarkable performance and received extensive attention. However, deploying Mamba2 on resource-constrained edge devices encounters many problems: severe outliers within the linear layer challenging the quantization, diverse and irregular element-wise tensor operations, and hardware-unfriendly nonlinear functions in the SSM block. To address these issues, this paper presents FastMamba, a dedicated accelerator on FPGA with hardware-algorithm co-design to promote the deployment efficiency of Mamba2. Specifically, we successfully achieve 8-bit quantization for linear layers through Hadamard transformation to eliminate outliers. Moreover, a hardware-friendly and fine-grained power-of-two quantization framework is presented for the SSM block and convolution layer, and a first-order linear approximation is developed to optimize the nonlinear functions. Based on the accurate algorithm quantization, we propose an accelerator that integrates parallel vector processing units, pipelined execution dataflow, and an efficient SSM Nonlinear Approximation Unit, which enhances computational efficiency and reduces hardware complexity. Finally, we evaluate FastMamba on Xilinx VC709 FPGA. For the input prefill task on Mamba2-130M, FastMamba achieves 68.80\times and 8.90\times speedup over Intel Xeon 4210R CPU and NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, respectively. In the output decode experiment with Mamba2-2.7B, FastMamba attains 6\times higher energy efficiency than RTX 3090 GPU."

2505.19349,"To alleviate the memory bandwidth bottleneck in Large Language Model (LLM) inference workloads, weight matrices are stored in memory in quantized and sparsified formats. Hence, before tiles of these matrices can be processed by in-core generalized matrix multiplication (GeMM) hardware engines, they need to be dequantized and de-sparsified. This is currently performed in software with vector operations. Unfortunately, this approach delivers only modest performance. Moreover, it is hard to understand how to improve the system, as the overall GeMM performance depends on the interaction between memory resources, vector units, and hardware matrix engines.To improve the performance of LLM inference in advanced platforms equipped with in-core GeMM engines and HBM, this paper makes three main contributions. First, it develops an analytical performance model with a 3D visual representation that provides insights into how memory resources, vector units, and hardware matrix engines interact to deliver compressed GeMM performance. Second, it proposes DECA, a new near-core ML-model decompression accelerator. DECA offloads tile de-sparsification and dequantization from the CPU, producing ready-to-use tiles for in-core GeMM engines. Third, it introduces a new ISA extension that enables out-of-order invocation of the near-core accelerator. With this extension, accelerator and core computations can interleave and overlap with high-performance. Our evaluation shows that, in a simulated 56-core Xeon 4 server with HBM, DECA accelerates the execution of compressed GeMMs by up to 4x over the use of optimized Intel software kernels. Further, DECA reduces the next-token generation time of Llama2-70B and OPT-66B by 1.6x-2.6x."
2505.19418,"Scan-based Design-for-Testability (DFT) measures are prevalent in modern digital integrated circuits to achieve high test quality at low hardware cost. With the advent of 3D heterogeneous integration and chiplet-based systems, the role of scan is becoming ever more important due to its ability to make internal design nodes controllable and observable in a systematic and scalable manner. However, the effectiveness of scan-based DFT suffers from poor testability of internal nodes for complex circuits at deep logic levels. Existing solutions to address this problem primarily rely on Test Point Insertion (TPI) in the nodes with poor controllability or observability. However, TPI-based solutions, while an integral part of commercial practice, come at a high design and hardware cost. To address this issue, in this paper, we present LITE, a novel ATPG-aware lightweight scan instrumentation approach that utilizes the functional flip-flops in a scan chain to make multiple internal nodes observable and controllable in a low-cost, scalable manner. We provide both circuit-level design as well as an algorithmic approach for automating the insertion of LITE for design modifications. We show that LITE significantly improves the testability in terms of the number of patterns and test coverage for ATPG and random pattern testability, respectively, while incurring considerably lower overhead than TPI-based solutions."
2505.2025,"Ising Machines are emerging hardware architectures that efficiently solve NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problems. Generally, combinatorial problems are transformed into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form, but this transformation often complicates the solution landscape, degrading performance, especially for multi-state problems. To address this challenge, we model spin interactions as generalized boolean logic function to significantly reduce the exploration space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on graph coloring problem using probabilistic Ising solvers, achieving similar accuracy compared to state-of-the-art heuristics and machine learning algorithms. It also shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art QUBO-based Ising solvers, including probabilistic Ising and simulated bifurcation machines. We also design 1024-neuron all-to-all connected probabilistic Ising accelerator on FPGA with the proposed approach that shows ~10000x performance acceleration compared to GPU-based Tabucol heuristics and reducing physical neurons by 1.5-4x over baseline Ising frameworks. Thus, this work establishes superior efficiency, scalability and solution quality for multi-state optimization problems."
2505.20849,"Hardware acceleration of algorithms is an effective method for improving performance in high-demand computational tasks.

In this paper, we present a framework for the static analysis of communication within datapath architectures designed for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Our framework aims to enhance hardware design and optimization by providing insights into communication patterns within the architecture, which are essential for ensuring efficient data handling."
2505.21669,"With ever-increasing main memory stall times, we need novel techniques to reduce effective memory access latencies. Prefetching has been shown to be an effective solution, especially with contiguous data structures that follow the traditional principles of spatial and temporal locality. However, on linked data structures$-$made up of many nodes linked together with pointers$-$typical prefetchers struggle, failing to predict accesses as elements are arbitrarily scattered throughout memory and access patters are arbitrarily complex and hence difficult to predict. To remedy these issues, we introduce $\textit{Linkey}$, a novel prefetcher that utilizes hints from the programmer/compiler to cache layout information and accurately prefetch linked data structures. $\textit{Linkey}$ obtains substantial performance improvements over a striding baseline. We achieve a geomean 13% reduction in miss rate with a maximum improvement of 58.8%, and a 65.4% geomean increase in accuracy, with many benchmarks improving from 0%. On benchmarks where $\textit{Linkey}$ is applicable, we observe a geomean IPC improvement of 1.40%, up to 12.1%."
2505.22086,"High-Level Synthesis (HLS) serves as an agile hardware development tool that streamlines the circuit design by abstracting the register transfer level into behavioral descriptions, while allowing designers to customize the generated microarchitectures through optimization directives. However, the combinatorial explosion of possible directive configurations yields an intractable design space. Traditional design space exploration (DSE) methods, despite adopting heuristics or constructing predictive models to accelerate Pareto-optimal design acquisition, still suffer from prohibitive exploration costs and suboptimal results. Addressing these concerns, we introduce iDSE, the first LLM-aided DSE framework that leverages HLS design quality perception to effectively navigate the design space. iDSE intelligently pruns the design space to guide LLMs in calibrating representative initial sampling designs, expediting convergence toward the Pareto front. By exploiting the convergent and divergent thinking patterns inherent in LLMs for hardware optimization, iDSE achieves multi-path refinement of the design quality and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that iDSE outperforms heuristic-based DSE methods by 5.1$\times$$\sim$16.6$\times$ in proximity to the reference Pareto front, matching NSGA-II with only 4.6% of the explored designs. Our work demonstrates the transformative potential of LLMs in scalable and efficient HLS design optimization, offering new insights into multiobjective optimization challenges."
2505.22194,"Vision Transformers (ViTs) leverage the transformer architecture to effectively capture global context, demonstrating strong performance in computer vision tasks. A major challenge in ViT hardware acceleration is that the model family contains complex arithmetic operations that are sensitive to model accuracy, such as the Softmax and LayerNorm operations, which cannot be mapped onto efficient hardware with low precision. Existing methods only exploit parallelism in the matrix multiplication operations of the model on hardware and keep these complex operations on the CPU. This results in suboptimal performance due to the communication overhead between the CPU and accelerator. Can new data formats solve this problem?In this work, we present the first ViT accelerator that maps all operations of the ViT models onto FPGAs. We exploit a new arithmetic format named Microscaling Integer (MXInt) for datapath designs and evaluate how different design choices can be made to trade off accuracy, hardware performance, and hardware utilization. Our contributions are twofold. First, we quantize ViTs using the MXInt format, achieving both high area efficiency and accuracy. Second, we propose MXInt-specific hardware optimization that map these complex arithmetic operations into custom hardware. Within 1\% accuracy loss, our method achieves at least 93$\times$ speedup compared to Float16 and at least 1.9$\times$ speedup compared to related work."
2505.22366,"The number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is increasing exponentially, and it is environmentally and economically unsustainable to power all these devices with batteries. The key alternative is energy harvesting, but battery-less IoT systems require extensive evaluation to demonstrate that they are sufficiently performant across the full range of expected operating conditions. IoT developers thus need an evaluation platform that (i) ensures that each evaluated application and configuration is exposed to exactly the same energy environment and events, and (ii) provides a detailed account of what the application spends the harvested energy on. We therefore developed the EStacker evaluation platform which (i) provides fair and repeatable evaluation, and (ii) generates energy stacks. Energy stacks break down the total energy consumption of an application across hardware components and application activities, thereby explaining what the application specifically uses energy on. We augment EStacker with the ST-SP optimization which, in our experiments, reduces evaluation time by 6.3x on average while retaining the temporal behavior of the battery-less IoT system (average throughput error of 7.7%) by proportionally scaling time and power. We demonstrate the utility of EStacker through two case studies. In the first case study, we use energy stack profiles to identify a performance problem that, once addressed, improves performance by 3.3x. The second case study focuses on ST-SP, and we use it to explore the design space required to dimension the harvester and energy storage sizes of a smart parking application in roughly one week (7.7 days). Without ST-SP, sweeping this design space would have taken well over one month (41.7 days)."
2505.22404,"Autonomous robots require efficient on-device learning to adapt to new environments without cloud dependency. For this edge training, Microscaling (MX) data types offer a promising solution by combining integer and floating-point representations with shared exponents, reducing energy consumption while maintaining accuracy. However, the state-of-the-art continuous learning processor, namely Dacapo, faces limitations with its MXINT-only support and inefficient vector-based grouping during backpropagation. In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first work that addresses these limitations with two key innovations: (1) a precision-scalable arithmetic unit that supports all six MX data types by exploiting sub-word parallelism and unified integer and floating-point processing; and (2) support for square shared exponent groups to enable efficient weight handling during backpropagation, removing storage redundancy and quantization overhead. We evaluate our design against Dacapo under iso-peak-throughput on four robotics workloads in TSMC 16nm FinFET technology at 400MHz, reaching a 51% lower memory footprint, and 4x higher effective training throughput, while achieving comparable energy efficiency, enabling efficient robotics continual learning at the edge."

The proposed implementation harnesses the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs to simulate large-scale OIM/OPMs, leveraging the advantages of digital computing to offer high precision, programmability, and scalability. The performance of the proposed GPU framework is evaluated on the max-cut problems from the GSET benchmark dataset and graph coloring problems from the SATLIB benchmarks dataset, demonstrating competitive speed and accuracy in tackling large-scale problems. The results from simulations, reaching up to 11295x speed-up over CPUs with up to 99% accuracy, establish this framework as a scalable, massively parallelized, and high-fidelity digital realization of OIM/OPMs."
2505.23073,"Indirect memory accesses frequently appear in applications where memory bandwidth is a critical bottleneck. Prior indirect memory access proposals, such as indirect prefetchers, runahead execution, fetchers, and decoupled access/execute architectures, primarily focus on improving memory access latency by loading data ahead of computation but still rely on the DRAM controllers to reorder memory requests and enhance memory bandwidth utilization. DRAM controllers have limited visibility to future memory accesses due to the small capacity of request buffers and the restricted memory-level parallelism of conventional core and memory systems. We introduce DX100, a programmable data access accelerator for indirect memory accesses. DX100 is shared across cores to offload bulk indirect memory accesses and associated address calculation operations. DX100 reorders, interleaves, and coalesces memory requests to improve DRAM row-buffer hit rate and memory bandwidth utilization. DX100 provides a general-purpose ISA to support diverse access types, loop patterns, conditional accesses, and address calculations. To support this accelerator without significant programming efforts, we discuss a set of MLIR compiler passes that automatically transform legacy code to utilize DX100. Experimental evaluations on 12 benchmarks spanning scientific computing, database, and graph applications show that DX100 achieves performance improvements of 2.6x over a multicore baseline and 2.0x over the state-of-the-art indirect prefetcher."
2505.23351,"Optimizing performance and energy efficiency in many-core processors, especially within Non-Uniform Cache Access (NUCA) architectures, remains a critical challenge. The performance heterogeneity inherent in S-NUCA systems complicates task scheduling due to varying cache access latencies across cores. This paper introduces a novel QoS management policy to maintain application execution within predefined Quality of Service (QoS) targets, measured using the Application Heartbeats framework. QoS metrics like Heartbeats ensure predictable application performance in dynamic computing environments. The proposed policy dynamically controls QoS by orchestrating task migrations within the S-NUCA many-core system and adjusting the clock frequency of cores. After satisfying the QoS objectives, the policy optimizes energy efficiency, reducing overall system energy consumption without compromising performance constraints. Our work leverages the state-of-the-art multi-/many-core simulator {\em HotSniper}. We have extended it with two key components: an integrated heartbeat framework for precise, application-specific performance monitoring, and our QoS management policy that maintains application QoS requirements while minimizing the system's energy consumption. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach effectively maintains desired QoS levels and achieves 18.7\% energy savings compared to state-of-the-art scheduling methods."
2505.23394,"This paper proposes a novel multi-antenna architecture, termed ray antenna array (RAA), which practically enables flexible beamforming and also enhances wireless communication performance for high frequency systems in a cost-effective manner. RAA consists of a large number of inexpensive antenna elements and a few radio frequency (RF) chains. These antenna elements are arranged in a novel ray like structure, where each ray corresponds to one simple uniform linear array (sULA) with a carefully designed orientation. The antenna elements within each sULA are directly connected, so that each sULA is able to form a beam towards a direction matching the ray orientation without relying on any analog or digital beamforming. By further designing a ray selection network (RSN), appropriate sULAs are selected to connect to the RF chains for subsequent baseband processing. Compared to conventional multi-antenna architectures such as the uniform linear array (ULA) with hybrid analog/digital beamforming (HBF), the proposed RAA enjoys three appealing advantages: (i) finer and uniform angular resolution for all signal directions; (ii) enhanced beamforming gain by using antenna elements with higher directivity, as each sULA is only responsible for a small portion of the total angle coverage range; and (iii) dramatically reduced hardware cost since no phase shifters are required, which are expensive and difficult to design in high-frequency systems such as mmWave and THz systems. To validate such advantages, we first present the input-output mathematical model for RAA-based wireless communications. Efficient algorithms for joint RAA beamforming and ray selection are then proposed for single-user and multi-user RAA-based wireless communications. Simulation results demonstrate that RAA achieves superior performance compared to the conventional ULA with HBF, while significantly reducing hardware cost."
2505.23553,"The ever-increasing complexity and operational diversity of modern Neural Networks (NNs) have caused the need for low-power and, at the same time, high-performance edge devices for AI applications. Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRAs) form a promising design paradigm to address these challenges, delivering a close-to-ASIC performance while allowing for hardware programmability. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end exploration and synthesis framework for approximate CGRA processors that enables transparent and optimized integration and mapping of state-of-the-art approximate multiplication components into CGRAs. Our methodology introduces a per-channel exploration strategy that maps specific output features onto approximate components based on accuracy degradation constraints. This enables the optimization of the system's energy consumption while retaining the accuracy above a certain threshold. At the circuit level, the integration of approximate components enables the creation of voltage islands that operate at reduced voltage levels, which is attributed to their inherently shorter critical paths. This key enabler allows us to effectively reduce the overall power consumption by an average of 30% across our analyzed architectures, compared to their baseline counterparts, while incurring only a minimal 2% area overhead. The proposed methodology was evaluated on a widely used NN model, MobileNetV2, on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating that the generated architectures can deliver up to 440 GOPS/W with relatively small output error during inference, outperforming several State-of-the-Art CGRA architectures in terms of throughput and energy efficiency."
2505.24137,"With the growing demand for intelligent computing, neuromorphic computing, a paradigm that mimics the structure and functionality of the human brain, offers a promising approach to developing new high-efficiency intelligent computing systems. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), the foundation of neuromorphic computing, have garnered significant attention due to their unique potential in energy efficiency and biomimetic neural processing. However, current hardware development for efficient SNN training lags significantly. No systematic energy evaluation methods exist for SNN training tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes an Energy-Oriented Computing Architecture Simulator (EOCAS) for SNN training to identify the optimal architecture. EOCAS investigates the high sparsity of spike signals, unique hardware design representations, energy assessment, and computation patterns to support energy optimization in various architectures. Under the guidance of EOCAS, we implement the power-aimed optimal hardware architecture through Verilog HDL and achieve low energy consumption using Synopsys Design Compiler with TSMC-28nm technology library under typical parameters. Compared with several State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) DNN and SNN works, our hardware architecture outstands others in various criteria."
2505.24363,"Open-source RISC-V cores are increasingly demanded in domains like automotive and space, where achieving high instructions per cycle (IPC) through superscalar and out-of-order (OoO) execution is crucial. However, high-performance open-source RISC-V cores face adoption challenges: some (e.g. BOOM, Xiangshan) are developed in Chisel with limited support from industrial electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Others, like the XuanTie C910 core, use proprietary interfaces and protocols, including non-standard AXI protocol extensions, interrupts, and debug support.In this work, we present a modified version of the OoO C910 core to achieve full RISC-V standard compliance in its debug, interrupt, and memory interfaces. We also introduce CVA6S+, an enhanced version of the dual-issue, industry-supported open-source CVA6 core. CVA6S+ achieves 34.4% performance improvement over CVA6 core.We conduct a detailed performance, area, power, and energy analysis on the superscalar out-of-order C910, superscalar in-order CVA6S+ and vanilla, single-issue in-order CVA6, all implemented in a 22nm technology and integrated into Cheshire, an open-source modular SoC. We examine the performance and efficiency of different microarchitectures using the same ISA, SoC, and implementation with identical technology, tools, and methodologies. The area and performance rankings of CVA6, CVA6S+, and C910 follow expected trends: compared to the scalar CVA6, CVA6S+ shows an area increase of 6% and an IPC improvement of 34.4%, while C910 exhibits a 75% increase in area and a 119.5% improvement in IPC. However, efficiency analysis reveals that CVA6S+ leads in area efficiency (GOPS/mm2), while the C910 is highly competitive in energy efficiency (GOPS/W). This challenges the common belief that high performance in superscalar and out-of-order cores inherently comes at a significant cost in area and energy efficiency."
2505.24509,"FALCON is a standardized quantum-resistant digital signature scheme that offers advantages over other schemes, but features more complex signature generation process. This paper presents Bi-Samplerz, a fully hardware-implemented, high-efficiency dual-path discrete Gaussian sampler designed to accelerate Falcon signature generation. Observing that the SamplerZ subroutine is consistently invoked in pairs during each signature generation, we propose a dual-datapath architecture capable of generating two sampling results simultaneously. To make the best use of coefficient correlation and the inherent properties of rejection sampling, we introduce an assistance mechanism that enables effective collaboration between the two datapaths, rather than simply duplicating the sampling process. Additionally, we incorporate several architectural optimizations over existing designs to further enhance speed, area efficiency, and resource utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that Bi-SamplerZ achieves the lowest sampling latency to date among existing designs, benefiting from fine-grained pipeline optimization and efficient control coordination. Compared with the state-of-the-art full hardware implementations, Bi-SamplerZ reduces the sampling cycle count by 54.1\% while incurring only a moderate increase in hardware resource consumption, thereby achieving the best-known area-time product (ATP) for fully hardware-based sampler designs. In addition, to facilitate comparison with existing works, we provide both ASIC and FPGA implementations. Together, these results highlight the suitability of Bi-SamplerZ as a high-performance sampling engine in standardized post-quantum cryptographic systems such as Falcon."
2505.24852,"On-device learning at the edge enables low-latency, private personalization with improved long-term robustness and reduced maintenance costs. Yet, achieving scalable, low-power end-to-end on-chip learning, especially from real-world sequential data with a limited number of examples, is an open challenge. Indeed, accelerators supporting error backpropagation optimize for learning performance at the expense of inference efficiency, while simplified learning algorithms often fail to reach acceptable accuracy targets. In this work, we present Chameleon, leveraging three key contributions to solve these challenges. (i) A unified learning and inference architecture supports few-shot learning (FSL), continual learning (CL) and inference at only 0.5% area overhead to the inference logic. (ii) Long temporal dependencies are efficiently captured with temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), enabling the first demonstration of end-to-end on-chip FSL and CL on sequential data and inference on 16-kHz raw audio. (iii) A dual-mode, matrix-multiplication-free compute array allows either matching the power consumption of state-of-the-art inference-only keyword spotting (KWS) accelerators or enabling $4.3\times$ higher peak GOPS.

By utilizing the instructional content provided by HDLBits, we evaluate the stability, limitations, and potential approaches for improving the success rates of these models. Furthermore, we explore the impact of using the prompt-refining method, To-do-Oriented Prompting (TOP) Patch, on the success rate of these LLM models in various FSM design scenarios. The results show that the systematic format prompt method and the novel prompt refinement method have the potential to be applied to other domains beyond HDL design automation, considering its possible integration with other prompt engineering techniques in the future."
2506.00002,"Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in the adoption of AI techniques to enhance electronic design automation. In particular, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant interest in LLM-assisted hardware design generation, spanning applications from classical digital circuits to quantum computing. Despite substantial progress in this direction, the quality of LLM-generated hardware design still cannot meet the requirements for practical deployment. In this work, we identify three critical challenges hindering the development of LLM-assisted hardware design generation: 1) limited data availability, 2) varied data quality, 3) inadequate inference-time efficiency. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces a two-stage framework for AI-assisted hardware design by exploring decentralized training and personalized inference. In the first stage, we propose to harness private domain design sources through a hierarchical decentralized training mechanism that addresses data-sharing constraints. To mitigate the impact of low-quality data, we identify optimization opportunities in hardware generation tasks, using user-defined metrics for model aggregation. The second stage focuses on client personalization to enhance both speed and quality. We introduce a new metric, Trueput, to analyze LLM-assisted hardware generation efficiency. To optimize Trueput, we implement personalized inference-time acceleration and customized sampling strategies. Evaluating both classical and quantum benchmarks, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage framework can significantly improve the model capability for hardware design generation. As orthogonal enhancements to existing methods, our framework can achieve $33\% \sim 50\%$ semantic accuracy improvement and $2.3$ times speedup, depending on the difficulty of the generation tasks."
2506.00004,"Analog In-Memory Compute (AIMC) can improve the energy efficiency of Deep Learning by orders of magnitude. Yet analog-domain device and circuit non-idealities -- within the analog ``Tiles'' performing Matrix-Vector Multiply (MVM) operations -- can degrade neural-network task accuracy. We quantify the impact of low-level distortions and noise, and develop a mathematical model for Multiply-ACcumulate (MAC) operations mapped to analog tiles. Instantaneous-current IR-drop (the most significant circuit non-ideality), and ADC quantization effects are fully captured by this model, which can predict MVM tile-outputs both rapidly and accurately, as compared to much slower rigorous circuit simulations. A statistical model of PCM read noise at nanosecond timescales is derived from -- and matched against -- experimental measurements. We integrate these (statistical) device and (deterministic) circuit effects into a PyTorch-based framework to assess the accuracy impact on the BERT and ALBERT Transformer networks. We show that hardware-aware fine-tuning using simple Gaussian noise provides resilience against ADC quantization and PCM read noise effects, but is less effective against IR-drop. This is because IR-drop -- although deterministic -- is non-linear, is changing significantly during the time-integration window, and is ultimately dependent on all the excitations being introduced in parallel into the analog tile. The apparent inability of simple Gaussian noise applied during training to properly prepare a DNN network for IR-drop during inference implies that more complex training approaches -- incorporating advances such as the Tile-circuit model introduced here -- will be critical for resilient deployment of large neural networks onto AIMC hardware."
2506.00005,"Automated Verilog code synthesis poses significant challenges and typically demands expert oversight. Traditional high-level synthesis (HLS) methods often fail to scale for real-world designs. While large language models (LLMs) have enhanced scalability, they often introduce syntactical and logical errors requiring extensive post-generation verification. Here, we introduce a novel conjunctive normal form (CNF)-guided synthesis methodology. The idea is to have an LLM generate CNF clauses, a format widely used for formal verification and synthesis validation in hardware design, but here it is used to formally describe the desired circuit functionality. These CNF specifications are then deterministically converted into Verilog, ensuring correctness by construction. Our approach fine-tunes an open-source and lightweight LLM, namely the CPU-deployable LLama-3.2-3B-Instruct model (parameters < 4B), on a dataset of standard RTL components. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reliably produces functionally correct Verilog code on the first attempt, compared to other lightweight open-source SoTA works such as Verigen (2B parameters) and RTLCoder (4-bit quantized with around 7B parameters).

2506.00008,"The rapid growth of large-language models (LLMs) is driving a new wave of specialized hardware for inference. This paper presents the first workload-centric, cross-architectural performance study of commercial AI accelerators, spanning GPU-based chips, hybrid packages, and wafer-scale engines. We compare memory hierarchies, compute fabrics, and on-chip interconnects, and observe up to 3.7x performance variation across architectures as batch size and sequence length change. Four scaling techniques for trillion-parameter models are examined; expert parallelism offers an 8.4x parameter-to-compute advantage but incurs 2.1x higher latency variance than tensor parallelism. These findings provide quantitative guidance for matching workloads to accelerators and reveal architectural gaps that next-generation designs must address."
2506.0002,"Transformers, while revolutionary, face challenges due to their demanding computational cost and large data movement. To address this, we propose HyFlexPIM, a novel mixed-signal processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerator for inference that flexibly utilizes both single-level cell (SLC) and multi-level cell (MLC) RRAM technologies to trade-off accuracy and efficiency. HyFlexPIM achieves efficient dual-mode operation by utilizing digital PIM for high-precision and write-intensive operations while analog PIM for high parallel and low-precision computations. The analog PIM further distributes tasks between SLC and MLC PIM operations, where a single analog PIM module can be reconfigured to switch between two operations (SLC/MLC) with minimal overhead (<1% for area & energy). Critical weights are allocated to SLC RRAM for high accuracy, while less critical weights are assigned to MLC RRAM to maximize capacity, power, and latency efficiency. However, despite employing such a hybrid mechanism, brute-force mapping on hardware fails to deliver significant benefits due to the limited proportion of weights accelerated by the MLC and the noticeable degradation in accuracy. To maximize the potential of our hybrid hardware architecture, we propose an algorithm co-optimization technique, called gradient redistribution, which uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose and truncate matrices based on their importance, then fine-tune them to concentrate significance into a small subset of weights. By doing so, only 5-10% of the weights have dominantly large gradients, making it favorable for HyFlexPIM by minimizing the use of expensive SLC RRAM while maximizing the efficient MLC RRAM. Our evaluation shows that HyFlexPIM significantly enhances computational throughput and energy efficiency, achieving maximum 1.86X and 1.45X higher than state-of-the-art methods."
2506.0114,"Ternary large language models (LLMs), which utilize ternary precision weights and 8-bit activations, have demonstrated competitive performance while significantly reducing the high computational and memory requirements of full-precision LLMs. The energy efficiency and performance of Ternary LLMs can be further improved by deploying them on ternary computing-in-memory (TCiM) accelerators, thereby alleviating the von-Neumann bottleneck. However, TCiM accelerators are prone to memory stuck-at faults (SAFs) leading to degradation in the model accuracy. This is particularly severe for LLMs due to their low weight sparsity. To boost the SAF tolerance of TCiM accelerators, we propose ReTern that is based on (i) fault-aware sign transformations (FAST) and (ii) TCiM bit-cell reprogramming exploiting their natural redundancy. The key idea is to utilize FAST to minimize computations errors due to SAFs in +1/-1 weights, while the natural bit-cell redundancy is exploited to target SAFs in 0 weights (zero-fix). Our experiments on BitNet b1.58 700M and 3B ternary LLMs show that our technique furnishes significant fault tolerance, notably 35% reduction in perplexity on the Wikitext dataset in the presence of faults. These benefits come at the cost of < 3%, < 7%, and < 1% energy, latency and area overheads respectively."
2506.01166,"Leveraging high degrees of unstructured sparsity is a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of deep neural network DNN accelerators - particularly important for emerging Edge-AI applications. We introduce VUSA, a systolic-array architecture that virtually grows based on the present sparsity to perform larger matrix multiplications with the same number of physical multiply-accumulate MAC units. The proposed architecture achieves saving by 37% and 68% in area and power efficiency, respectively, at the same peak-performance, compared to a baseline systolic array architecture in a commercial 16-nm technology. Still, the proposed architecture supports acceleration for any DNN with any sparsity - even no sparsity at all. Thus, the proposed architecture is application-independent, making it viable for general-purpose AI acceleration."
2506.0229,"In modern computing systems, compilation employs numerous optimization techniques to enhance code performance. Source-to-source code transformations, which include control flow and datapath transformations, have been widely used in High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and compiler optimization.While researchers actively investigate methods to improve performance with source-to-source code transformations, they often overlook the significance of verifying their correctness. Current tools cannot provide a holistic verification of these transformations. This paper introduces HEC, a framework for equivalence checking that leverages the e-graph data structure to comprehensively verify functional equivalence between programs. HEC utilizes the MLIR as its frontend and integrates MLIR into the e-graph framework. Through the combination of dynamic and static e-graph rewriting, HEC facilitates the validation of comprehensive code transformations.We demonstrate effectiveness of HEC on PolyBenchC benchmarks, successfully verifying loop unrolling, tiling, and fusion transformations. HEC processes over 100,000 lines of MLIR code in 40 minutes with predictable runtime scaling. Importantly, HEC identified two critical compilation errors in mlir-opt: loop boundary check errors causing unintended executions during unrolling, and memory read-after-write violations in loop fusion that alter program semantics. These findings demonstrate HEC practical value in detecting real-world compiler bugs and highlight the importance of formal verification in optimization pipelines."
2506.02311,"Compute-in-memory (CIM) architecture has been widelyexplored to address the von Neumann bottleneck in accelerating deepneural networks (DNNs). However, its reliability remains largely understudied, particularly in the emerging domain of floating-point (FP)CIM, which is crucial for speeding up high-precision inference and on device training. This paper introduces Unicorn-CIM, a framework touncover the vulnerability and improve the resilience of high-precisionCIM, built on static random-access memory (SRAM)-based FP CIMarchitecture. Through the development of fault injection and extensivecharacterizations across multiple DNNs, Unicorn-CIM reveals how softerrors manifest in FP operations and impact overall model performance.Specifically, we find that high-precision DNNs are extremely sensitiveto errors in the exponent part of FP numbers. Building on this insight,Unicorn-CIM develops an efficient algorithm-hardware co-design methodthat optimizes model exponent distribution through fine-tuning andincorporates a lightweight Error Correcting Code (ECC) scheme tosafeguard high-precision DNNs on FP CIM. Comprehensive experimentsshow that our approach introduces just an 8.98% minimal logic overheadon the exponent processing path while providing robust error protectionand maintaining model accuracy.

2506.02344,"Accurate performance projection of large-scale benchmarks is essential for CPU architects to evaluate and optimize future processor designs. SimPoint sampling, which uses Basic Block Vectors (BBVs), is a widely adopted technique to reduce simulation time by selecting representative program phases. However, BBVs often fail to capture the behavior of applications with extensive array-indirect memory accesses, leading to inaccurate projections. In particular, the 523.xalancbmk_r benchmark exhibits complex data movement patterns that challenge traditional SimPoint methods. To address this, we propose enhancing SimPoint's BBV methodology by incorporating Memory Access Vectors (MAV), a microarchitecture independent technique that tracks functional memory access patterns. This combined approach significantly improves the projection accuracy of 523.xalancbmk_r on a 192-core system-on-chip, increasing it from 80% to 98%."
2506.02523,"Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, improves the efficiency of large language models by projecting query, key, and value tensors into a compact latent space. This architectural change reduces the KV-cache size and significantly lowers memory bandwidth demands, particularly in the autoregressive decode phase. This letter presents the first hardware-centric analysis of MLA, comparing it to conventional Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and evaluating its implications for accelerator performance. We identify two alternative execution schemes of MLA--reusing, resp. recomputing latent projection matrices--which offer distinct trade-offs between compute and memory access. Using the Stream design space exploration framework, we model their throughput and energy cost across a range of hardware platforms and find that MLA can shift attention workloads toward the compute-bound regime.Our results show that MLA not only reduces bandwidth usage but also enables adaptable execution strategies aligned with hardware constraints. Compared to MHA, it provides more stable and efficient performance, particularly on bandwidth-limited hardware platforms. These findings emphasize MLA's relevance as a co-design opportunity for future AI accelerators."
2506.02847,"Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices is crucial for delivering fast responses and ensuring data privacy. However, the limited storage, weight, and power of edge devices make it difficult to deploy LLM-powered applications. These devices must balance latency requirements with energy consumption and model accuracy. In this paper, we first quantify the challenges of deploying LLMs on off-the-shelf edge devices and then we present CLONE, an in-depth algorithm-hardware co-design at both the model- and system-level that intelligently integrates real-time, energy optimization while maintaining robust generality. In order to maximize the synergistic benefits of these algorithms in always-on and intermediate edge computing settings, we specialize in a 28nm scalable hardware accelerator system. We implement and extensively evaluate CLONE on two off-the-shelf edge platforms. Experiments show that CLONE effectively accelerates the inference process up to 11.92x, and saves energy up to 7.36x, while maintaining high-generation."
2506.02929,"Computer System Architecture serves as a crucial bridge between software applications and the underlying hardware, encompassing components like compilers, CPUs, coprocessors, and RTL designs. Its development, from early mainframes to modern domain-specific architectures, has been driven by rising computational demands and advancements in semiconductor technology. However, traditional paradigms in computer system architecture design are confronting significant challenges, including a reliance on manual expertise, fragmented optimization across software and hardware layers, and high costs associated with exploring expansive design spaces. While automated methods leveraging optimization algorithms and machine learning have improved efficiency, they remain constrained by a single-stage focus, limited data availability, and a lack of comprehensive human domain knowledge. The emergence of large language models offers transformative opportunities for the design of computer system architecture. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs in areas such as code generation, data analysis, and performance modeling, the traditional manual design process can be transitioned to a machine-based automated design approach. To harness this potential, we present the Large Processor Chip Model (LPCM), an LLM-driven framework aimed at achieving end-to-end automated computer architecture design. The LPCM is structured into three levels: Human-Centric; Agent-Orchestrated; and Model-Governed. This paper utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting as a representative workload and employs the concept of software-hardware collaborative design to examine the implementation of the LPCM at Level 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, this paper provides an in-depth discussion on the pathway to implementing Level 2 and Level 3 of the LPCM, along with an analysis of the existing challenges."
2506.04544,"Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v (""HDL-to-Verilog""), a dataset which seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL, Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32 billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2, without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better performance."
2506.0464,"Multicore timing interference, arising when multiple requests contend for the same shared hardware resources, is a primary concern for timing verification and validation of time-critical applications. Bandwidth control and regulation approaches have been proposed in the literature as an effective method to monitor and limit the impact of timing interference at run time. These approaches seek for fine-grained control of the bandwidth consumption (at the microsecond level) to meet stringent timing requirements on embedded critical systems. Such granularity and configurations, while effective, can become an entry barrier for the application of bandwidth control to a wide class of productized, modular ROS2 applications. This is so because those applications have less stringent timing requirements but would still benefit from bandwidth regulation, though under less restrictive, and therefore more portable, granularity and configurations.In this work, we provide ROSGuard, a highly-portable, modular implementation of a timing interference monitoring and control mechanism that builds on the abstractions available on top of a generic and portable Linux-based software stack with the Robotic Operating System 2 (ROS2) layer, a widespreadedly adopted middleware for a wide class of industrial applications, far beyond the robotic domain. We deploy ROSGuard on an NVIDIA AGX Orin platform as a representative target for functionally rich distributed AI-based applications and a set of synthetic and real-world benchmarks. We apply an effective bandwidth regulation scheme on ROS2-based applications and achieve comparable effectiveness to specialized, finer-grained state-of-the-art solutions."
2506.05007,"Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving breakthroughs in computer science and related fields. With the rapid advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the escalating demands for design resources, and the increasing diversity of ecosystems. Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative solution to address these challenges. While recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques, have opened new possibilities for fully automated processor chip design, substantial challenges remain in establishing domain-specific LLMs for processor chip design.In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips. Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated hardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on integrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system."
2506.05566,"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled near-human performance on software coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness in RTL code generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data. While prior efforts have fine-tuned LLMs for RTL tasks, they do not fundamentally overcome the data bottleneck and lack support for test-time scaling due to their non-reasoning nature. In this work, we introduce ScaleRTL, the first reasoning LLM for RTL coding that scales up both high-quality reasoning data and test-time compute. Specifically, we curate a diverse set of long chain-of-thought reasoning traces averaging 56K tokens each, resulting in a dataset of 3.5B tokens that captures rich RTL knowledge. Fine-tuning a general-purpose reasoning model on this corpus yields ScaleRTL that is capable of deep RTL reasoning. Subsequently, we further enhance the performance of ScaleRTL through a novel test-time scaling strategy that extends the reasoning process via iteratively reflecting on and self-correcting previous reasoning steps. Experimental results show that ScaleRTL achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, outperforming 18 competitive baselines by up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM."
2506.05682,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has vastly advanced the pace of neural rendering, but it remains computationally demanding on today's mobile SoCs. To address this challenge, we propose Lumina, a hardware-algorithm co-designed system, which integrates two principal optimizations: a novel algorithm, S^2, and a radiance caching mechanism, RC, to improve the efficiency of neural rendering. S2 algorithm exploits temporal coherence in rendering to reduce the computational overhead, while RC leverages the color integration process of 3DGS to decrease the frequency of intensive rasterization computations. Coupled with these techniques, we propose an accelerator architecture, LuminCore, to further accelerate cache lookup and address the fundamental inefficiencies in Rasterization. We show that Lumina achieves 4.5x speedup and 5.3x energy reduction against a mobile Volta GPU, with a marginal quality loss (< 0.2 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio reduction) across synthetic and real-world datasets."

We examine the RV32I base instruction set with extensions for multiplication (M) and atomic operations (A). Through cycle-accurate simulation of a pipelined implementation, we evaluate performance metrics including CPI (cycles per instruction) and power efficiency. Our results demonstrate RISC-V's advantages in embedded systems and its scalability for custom accelerators. Comparative analysis shows a 17% reduction in power consumption compared to ARM Cortex-M0 implementations in similar process nodes. The open-standard nature of RISC-V provides significant flexibility for domain-specific optimizations."

We propose DockerSSD, an ISP model leveraging OS-level virtualization and lightweight firmware to enable containerized data processing directly on SSDs. Key features include Ethernet over NVMe for network-based ISP management and Virtual Firmware for secure, efficient container execution. DockerSSD supports disaggregated storage pools, reducing host overhead and enhancing large-scale services like LLM inference. It achieves up to 2.0x better performance for I/O-intensive workloads, and 7.9x improvement in distributed LLM inference."
2506.06773,"Branch prediction is key to the performance of out-of-order processors. While the CBP-2016 winner TAGE-SC-L combines geometric-history tables, a statistical corrector, and a loop predictor, over half of its remaining mispredictions stem from a small set of hard-to-predict (H2P) branches. These branches occur under diverse global histories, causing repeated thrashing in TAGE and eviction before usefulness counters can mature. Prior work shows that simply enlarging the tables offers only marginal improvement.We augment a 159 KB TAGE-SC-L predictor with a 28 KB H2P-targeted subsystem called the Bullseye predictor. It identifies problematic PCs using a set-associative H2P Identification Table (HIT) and steers them to one of two branch-specific perceptrons, one indexed by hashed local history and the other by folded global history. A short trial phase tracks head-to-head accuracy in an H2P cache. A branch becomes perceptron-resident only if the perceptron's sustained accuracy and output magnitude exceed dynamic thresholds, after which TAGE updates for that PC are suppressed to reduce pollution. The HIT, cache, and perceptron operate fully in parallel with TAGE-SC-L, providing higher fidelity on the H2P tail. This achieves an average MPKI of 3.4045 and CycWpPKI of 145.09."
2506.06817,"Bayesian Optimization (BO) has shown promise in tuning processor design parameters. However, standard BO does not support constraints involving categorical parameters such as types of branch predictors and division circuits. In addition, optimization time of BO grows with processor complexity, which becomes increasingly significant especially for FPGA-based soft processors. This paper introduces ASPO, an approach that leverages disjunctive form to enable BO to handle constraints involving categorical parameters. Unlike existing methods that directly apply standard BO, the proposed ASPO method, for the first time, customizes the mathematical mechanism of BO to address challenges faced by soft-processor designs on FPGAs. Specifically, ASPO supports categorical parameters using a novel customized BO covariance kernel. It also accelerates the design evaluation procedure by penalizing the BO acquisition function with potential evaluation time and by reusing FPGA synthesis checkpoints from previously evaluated configurations. ASPO targets three soft processors: RocketChip, BOOM, and EL2 VeeR. The approach is evaluated based on seven RISC-V benchmarks. Results show that ASPO can reduce execution time for the ``multiply'' benchmark on the BOOM processor by up to 35\% compared to the default configuration. Furthermore, it reduces design time for the BOOM processor by up to 74\% compared to Boomerang, a state-of-the-art hardware-oriented BO approach."
2506.07046,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) has outperformed other counterparts in sequential decision-making and dynamic environment control. However, FPGA deployment is significantly resource-expensive, as associated with large number of computations in training agents with high-quality images and possess new challenges.

QForce-RL takes advantages from E2HRL to reduce overall RL actions to learn desired policy and QuaRL for quantization based SIMD for hardware acceleration. We have also provided detailed analysis for different RL environments, with emphasis on model size, parameters, and accelerated compute ops. The architecture is scalable for resource-constrained devices and provide parametrized efficient deployment with flexibility in latency, throughput, power, and energy efficiency.

2506.07126,"Design rule checking (DRC) is of great significance for cost reduction and design efficiency improvement in integrated circuit (IC) designs. Machine-learning-based DRC has become an important approach in computer-aided design (CAD). In this paper, we propose MAGNet, a hybrid deep learning model that integrates an improved U-Net with a graph neural network for DRC violation prediction. The U-Net backbone is enhanced with a Dynamic Attention Module (DAM) and a Multi-Scale Convolution Module (MSCM) to strengthen its capability in extracting fine-grained and multi-scale spatial features. In parallel, we construct a pixel-aligned graph structure based on chip layout tiles, and apply a specialized GNN to model the topological relationships among pins. During graph construction, a graph-to-grid mapping is generated to align GNN features with the layout image. In addition, a label amplification strategy is adopted during training to enhance the model's sensitivity to sparse violation patterns. Overall, MAGNet effectively combines spatial, semantic, and structural information, achieving improved prediction accuracy and reduced false positive rates in DRC hotspot detection. Subsequently, through incremental training, we achieve a more sensitive discrimination ability for hotspots. The results demonstrate that, in comparison with ibUnet, RouteNet, and J-Net, MAGnet significantly outperforms these models, achieving substantial improvements in overall performance."
2506.07239,"Modern chip design is complex, and there is a crucial need for early-stage prediction of key design-quality metrics like timing and routing congestion directly from Verilog code (a commonly used programming language for hardware design). It is especially important yet complex to predict individual lines of code that cause timing violations or downstream routing congestion. Prior works have tried approaches like converting Verilog into an intermediate graph representation and using LLM embeddings alongside other features to predict module-level quality, but did not consider line-level quality prediction. We propose VeriLoC, the first method that predicts design quality directly from Verilog at both the line- and module-level. To this end, VeriLoC leverages recent Verilog code-generation LLMs to extract local line-level and module-level embeddings, and train downstream classifiers/regressors on concatenations of these embeddings. VeriLoC achieves high F1-scores of 0.86-0.95 for line-level congestion and timing prediction, and reduces the mean average percentage error from 14% - 18% for SOTA methods down to only 4%. We believe that VeriLoC embeddings and insights from our work will also be of value for other predictive and optimization tasks for complex hardware design."

2506.07665,"FREESS is a free, interactive simulator that illustrates instruction-level parallelism in a RISC-V-inspired superscalar processor. Based on an extended version of Tomasulo's algorithm, FREESS is intended as a hands-on educational tool for Advanced Computer Architecture courses. It enables students to explore dynamic, out-of-order instruction execution, emphasizing how instructions are issued as soon as their operands become available.The simulator models key microarchitectural components, including the Instruction Window (IW), Reorder Buffer (ROB), Register Map (RM), Free Pool (FP), and Load/Store Queues. FREESS allows users to dynamically configure runtime parameters, such as the superscalar issue width, functional unit types and latencies, and the sizes of architectural buffers and queues.To simplify learning, the simulator uses a minimal instruction set inspired by RISC-V (ADD, ADDI, BEQ, BNE, LW, MUL, SW), which is sufficient to demonstrate key pipeline stages: fetch, register renaming, out-of-order dispatch, execution, completion, commit, speculative branching, and memory access.

2506.07945,"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in generating code for general-purpose programming languages. However, their potential for hardware description languages (HDLs), such as SystemVerilog, remains largely unexplored. HDL code generation poses unique challenges due to strict timing semantics, concurrency, and synthesizability constraints essential for correct hardware functionality. Further, HDL-based design flows encompass a broad set of tasks beyond structural code generation, including testbench development, assertion-based verification, timing closure, and protocol-level integration for on-chip communication. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of both open-source and state-of-the-art LLMs in generating synthesizable and functionally accurate SystemVerilog implementations of widely used communication protocols that are critical components of embedded and System-on-Chip (SoC) systems. We introduce ProtocolLLM, the first benchmark suite specifically targeting these protocols with tasks spanning multiple design abstraction levels and varying prompt specificity. Our evaluation method also focuses on timing correctness in addition to synthesizability and syntactic correctness. We observe that most of the models fail to generate SystemVerilog code for communication protocols that follow timing constrains."
2506.07957,"Homomorphic Encryption (HE) enables secure computation on encrypted data without decryption, allowing a great opportunity for privacy-preserving computation. In particular, domains such as healthcare, finance, and government, where data privacy and security are of utmost importance, can benefit from HE by enabling third-party computation and services on sensitive data. In other words, HE constitutes the ""Holy Grail"" of cryptography: data remains encrypted all the time, being protected while in use.HE's security guarantees rely on noise added to data to make relatively simple problems computationally intractable. This error-centric intrinsic HE mechanism generates new challenges related to the fault tolerance and robustness of HE itself: hardware- and software-induced errors during HE operation can easily evade traditional error detection and correction mechanisms, resulting in silent data corruption (SDC).In this work, we motivate a thorough discussion regarding the sensitivity of HE applications to bit faults and provide a detailed error characterization study of CKKS (Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song). This is one of the most popular HE schemes due to its fixed-point arithmetic support for AI and machine learning applications. We also delve into the impact of the residue number system (RNS) and the number theoretic transform (NTT), two widely adopted HE optimization techniques, on CKKS' error sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that looks into the robustness and error sensitivity of homomorphic encryption and, as such, it can pave the way for critical future work in this area."

However, its adoption is hindered by significant computational overhead, requiring 10000-fold more computation compared to plaintext processing. Recent advancements in FHE accelerators have successfully improved server-side performance, but client-side computations remain a bottleneck, particularly under bootstrappable parameter configurations, which involve combinations of encoding, encrypt, decoding, and decrypt for large-sized parameters. To address this challenge, we propose ABC-FHE, an area- and power-efficient FHE accelerator that supports bootstrappable parameters on the client side. ABC-FHE employs a streaming architecture to maximize performance density, minimize area usage, and reduce off-chip memory access. Key innovations include a reconfigurable Fourier engine capable of switching between NTT and FFT modes. Additionally, an on-chip pseudo-random number generator and a unified on-the-fly twiddle factor generator significantly reduce memory demands, while optimized task scheduling enhances the CKKS client-side processing, achieving reduced latency. Overall, ABC-FHE occupies a die area of 28.638 mm2 and consumes 5.654 W of power in 28 nm technology. It delivers significant performance improvements, achieving a 1112x speed-up in encoding and encryption execution time compared to a CPU, and 214x over the state-of-the-art client-side accelerator.

While Mixture-of-Experts Vision Transformers (MoE-ViTs) mitigate this through a scalable architecture with sub-linear computational growth, their hardware implementation on FPGAs remains constrained by resource limitations. This paper proposes a novel accelerator for efficiently implementing quantized MoE models on FPGAs through two key innovations: (1) A dual-stage quantization scheme combining precision-preserving complex quantizers with hardware-friendly simplified quantizers via scale reparameterization, with only 0.28 $\%$ accuracy loss compared to full precision; (2) A resource-aware accelerator architecture featuring latency-optimized streaming attention kernels and reusable linear operators, effectively balancing performance and resource consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that our accelerator achieves nearly 155 frames per second, a 5.35$\times$ improvement in throughput, and over $80\%$ energy reduction compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) FPGA MoE accelerators, while maintaining $<1\%$ accuracy loss across vision benchmarks.

However, the temporal dependency and irregularity of spikes present significant challenges for hardware parallel processing and data reuse, leading to some existing accelerators falling short in processing latency and energy efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the STI-SNN accelerator, designed for resource-constrained applications with high energy efficiency, flexibility, and low latency. The accelerator is designed through algorithm and hardware co-design. Firstly, STI-SNN can perform inference in a single timestep. At the algorithm level, we introduce a temporal pruning approach based on the temporal efficient training (TET) loss function. This approach alleviates spike disappearance during timestep reduction, maintains inference accuracy, and expands TET's application. In hardware design, we analyze data access patterns and adopt the output stationary (OS) dataflow, eliminating the need to store membrane potentials and access memory operations. Furthermore, based on the OS dataflow, we propose a compressed and sorted representation of spikes, then cached in the line buffer to reduce the memory access cost and improve reuse efficiency. Secondly, STI-SNN supports different convolution methods. By adjusting the computation mode of processing elements (PEs) and parameterizing the computation array, STI-SNN can accommodate lightweight models based on depthwise separable convolutions (DSCs), further enhancing hardware flexibility. Lastly, STI-SNN also supports both inter-layer and intra-layer parallel processing. For inter-layer parallelism, we ..."
2506.09426,"Rewriting x86_64 binaries-whether for security hardening, dynamic instrumentation, or performance profiling is notoriously difficult due to variable-length instructions, interleaved code and data, and indirect jumps to arbitrary byte offsets. Existing solutions (e.g., ""superset disassembly"") ensure soundness but incur significant overhead and produce large rewritten binaries, especially for on-the-fly instrumentation. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing the Time Variance Authority (TVA), which leverages Intel's Control-Flow Enforcement Technology (CET). By recognizing endbr64 as the only valid indirect jump target, TVA prunes spurious disassembly paths while preserving soundness and emulates CET constraints on processors lacking native CET support, effectively mitigating ROP/JOP exploits without new hardware. We implement TVA by modernizing the Multiverse rewriter for 64-bit Linux. Our evaluation on SPEC CPU2017 and real-world applications shows that TVA-guided rewriting achieves up to 1.3x faster instrumentation time. These results underscore TVA's feasibility as a high-performance, uprobes-free alternative for robust x86_64 binary analysis and rewriting."
2506.09596,"Electronic devices primarily aim to offer low power consumption, high speed, and a compact area. The performance of very large-scale integration (VLSI) devices is influenced by arithmetic operations, where multiplication is a crucial operation. Therefore, a high-speed multiplier is essential for developing any signal-processing module. Numerous multipliers have been reviewed in existing literature, and their speed is largely determined by how partial products (PPs) are accumulated. To enhance the speed of multiplication beyond current methods, an approximate adder-based multiplier is introduced. This approach allows for the simultaneous addition of PPs from two consecutive bits using a novel approximate adder. The proposed multiplier is utilized in a mean filter structure and implemented in ISE Design Suite 14.7 using VHDL and synthesized on the Xilinx Spartan3-XC3S400 FPGA board. Compared to the literature, the proposed multiplier achieves power and power-delay product (PDP) improvements of 56.09% and 73.02%, respectively. The validity of the expressed multiplier is demonstrated through the mean filter system. Results show that it achieves power savings of 33.33%. Additionally, the proposed multiplier provides more accurate results than other approximate multipliers by expressing higher values of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), (30.58%), and structural similarity index metric (SSIM), (22.22%), while power consumption is in a low range."
2506.10373,"Over the years, the chip industry has consistently developed high-performance processors to address the increasing demands across diverse applications. However, the rapid expansion of chip production has significantly increased carbon emissions, raising critical concerns about environmental sustainability. While researchers have previously modeled the carbon footprint (CFP) at both system and processor levels, a holistic analysis of sustainability trends encompassing the entire chip lifecycle remains lacking. This paper presents CarbonSet, a comprehensive dataset integrating sustainability and performance metrics for CPUs and GPUs over the past decade. CarbonSet aims to benchmark and assess the design of next-generation processors. Leveraging this dataset, we conducted detailed analysis of flagship processors' sustainability trends over the last decade. This paper further highlights that modern processors are not yet sustainably designed, with total carbon emissions increasing more than 50$\times$ in the past three years due to the surging demand driven by the AI boom. Power efficiency remains a significant concern, while advanced process nodes pose new challenges requiring to effectively amortize the dramatically increased manufacturing carbon emissions."
2506.10441,"DRAM is a critical component of modern computing systems. Recent works propose numerous techniques (that we call DRAM techniques) to enhance DRAM-based computing systems' throughput, reliability, and computing capabilities (e.g., in-DRAM bulk data copy). Evaluating the system-wide benefits of DRAM techniques is challenging as they often require modifications across multiple layers of the computing stack. Prior works propose FPGA-based platforms for rapid end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM chips. Unfortunately, existing platforms fall short in two major aspects: (1) they require deep expertise in hardware description languages, limiting accessibility; and (2) they are not designed to accurately model modern computing systems.We introduce EasyDRAM, an FPGA-based framework for rapid and accurate end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM chips. EasyDRAM overcomes the main drawbacks of prior FPGA-based platforms with two key ideas. First, EasyDRAM removes the need for hardware description language expertise by enabling developers to implement DRAM techniques using a high-level language (C++). At runtime, EasyDRAM executes the software-defined memory system design in a programmable memory controller. Second, EasyDRAM tackles a fundamental challenge in accurately modeling modern systems: real processors typically operate at higher clock frequencies than DRAM, a disparity that is difficult to replicate on FPGA platforms. EasyDRAM addresses this challenge by decoupling the processor-DRAM interface and advancing the system state using a novel technique we call time scaling, which faithfully captures the timing behavior of the modeled system.We believe and hope that EasyDRAM will enable innovative ideas in memory system design to rapidly come to fruition. To aid future research EasyDRAM implementation is open sourced atthis https URL."
2506.10921,"The growing computational demands of machine learning (ML) workloads have driven the design of ML accelerators aiming at an optimal tradeoff between efficiency and flexibility. A widely explored architecture for flexible ML accelerators is based on clusters of lightweight instruction processors sharing multi-banked L1 memory, augmented with specialized instruction extensions for key ML-related computations, such as matrix multiplication (matmul). However, instruction extensions should be coupled with microarchitectural optimizations that remove inefficiencies due to control flow (loop handling) and memory access, without drastically increasing processor complexity. Moving from a state-of-the-art (SoA) ML accelerator cluster based on RISC-V processors, we propose a low-overhead optimized microarchitecture that eliminates these inefficiencies almost entirely while retaining programmability. We introduce ""zero-overhead loop nests"" to remove control overheads, and a ""zero-conflict memory subsystem"", leveraging a novel double-buffering-aware interconnect, to eliminate bank conflicts in L1 memory. With these enhancements, we attain near-ideal utilizations between 96.1% and 99.4%, achieving 11% performance and 8% energy efficiency improvements over the baseline SoA RISC-V cluster. We demonstrate comparable utilizations and performance to a specialized SoA accelerator, with only 12% difference in energy efficiency, while providing a fully-programmable general-purpose solution supporting a significantly wider range of workloads."
2506.10931,"Raw signal genome analysis (RSGA) has emerged as a promising approach to enable real-time genome analysis by directly analyzing raw electrical signals. However, rapid advancements in sequencing technologies make it increasingly difficult for software-based RSGA to match the throughput of raw signal generation. This paper demonstrates that while hardware acceleration techniques can significantly accelerate RSGA, the high volume of genomic data shifts the performance and energy bottleneck from computation to I/O data movement. As sequencing throughput increases, I/O overhead becomes the main contributor to both runtime and energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need to design a high-performance, energy-efficient system for RSGA that can both alleviate the data movement bottleneck and provide large acceleration capabilities. We propose MARS, a storage-centric system that leverages the heterogeneous resources within modern storage systems (e.g., storage-internal DRAM, storage controller, flash chips) alongside their large storage capacity to tackle both data movement and computational overheads of RSGA in an area-efficient and low-cost manner. MARS accelerates RSGA through a novel hardware/software co-design approach. First, MARS modifies the RSGA pipeline via two filtering mechanisms and a quantization scheme, reducing hardware demands and optimizing for in-storage execution. Second, MARS accelerates the RSGA steps directly within the storage by leveraging both Processing-Near-Memory and Processing-Using-Memory paradigms. Third, MARS orchestrates the execution of all steps to fully exploit in-storage parallelism and minimize data movement. Our evaluation shows that MARS outperforms basecalling-based software and hardware-accelerated state-of-the-art read mapping pipelines by 93x and 40x, on average across different datasets, while reducing their energy consumption by 427x and 72x."

2506.11329,"In modern server CPUs, the Last-Level Cache (LLC) serves not only as a victim cache for higher-level private caches but also as a buffer for low-latency DMA transfers between CPU cores and I/O devices through Direct Cache Access (DCA). However, prior work has shown that high-bandwidth network-I/O devices can rapidly flood the LLC with packets, often causing significant contention with co-running workloads. One step further, this work explores hidden microarchitectural properties of the Intel Xeon CPUs, uncovering two previously unrecognized LLC contentions triggered by emerging high-bandwidth I/O devices. Specifically, (C1) DMA-written cache lines in LLC ways designated for DCA (referred to as DCA ways) are migrated to certain LLC ways (denoted as inclusive ways) when accessed by CPU cores, unexpectedly contending with non-I/O cache lines within the inclusive ways. In addition, (C2) high-bandwidth storage-I/O devices, which are increasingly common in datacenter servers, benefit little from DCA while contending with (latency-sensitive) network-I/O devices within DCA ways. To this end, we present \design, a runtime LLC management framework designed to alleviate both (C1) and (C2) among diverse co-running workloads, using a hidden knob and other hardware features implemented in those CPUs. Additionally, we demonstrate that \design can also alleviate other previously known network-I/O-driven LLC contentions. Overall, it improves the performance of latency-sensitive, high-priority workloads by 51\% without notably compromising that of low-priority workloads."
2506.11441,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain prevalent in computer vision applications, and FPGAs, known for their flexibility and energy efficiency, have become essential components in heterogeneous acceleration systems. However, traditional FPGAs face challenges in balancing performance and versatility due to limited on-chip resources. AMD's Versal ACAP architecture, tailored for AI applications, incorporates AI Engines (AIEs) to deliver high computational power. Nevertheless, the platform suffers from insufficient memory bandwidth, hindering the full utilization of the AIEs' theoretical performance. In this paper, we present DPUV4E for the Versal architecture, providing configurations ranging from 2PE ($32.6$ TOPS) to 8PE ($131.0$ TOPS). We design two computation units, Conv PE and DWC PE, to support different computational patterns. Each computation unit's data flow efficiently utilizes the data reuse opportunities to mitigate bandwidth bottlenecks. Additionally, we extend the functionality of each PE to utilize AIEs for non-convolutional operations, reducing resource overhead. Experiments on over 50 models show that compared to previous designs, our design provides $8.6\times$ the TOPS/W of traditional FPGA-based DPU designs, while reducing DSP usage by $95.8\%$, LUT usage by $44.7\%$, and latency to $68.5\%$ under single-batch conditions. For end-to-end inference, our design improving throughput by up to $2.2\times$ for depth-wise convolution models and up to $1.3\times$ for standard models."

To address this issue, prior research has explored virtualization techniques for monolithic NPUs, but has neglected inter-core connected NPUs with the hardware topology.This paper introduces vNPU, the first comprehensive virtualization design for inter-core connected NPUs, integrating three novel techniques: (1) NPU route virtualization, which redirects instruction and data flow from virtual NPU cores to physical ones, creating a virtual topology; (2) NPU memory virtualization, designed to minimize translation stalls for SRAM-centric and NoC-equipped NPU cores, thereby maximizing the memory bandwidth; and (3) Best-effort topology mapping, which determines the optimal mapping from all candidate virtual topologies, balancing resource utilization with end-to-end performance. We have developed a prototype of vNPU on both an FPGA platform (Chipyard+FireSim) and a simulator (DCRA). Evaluation results indicate that, compared to other virtualization approaches such as unified virtual memory and MIG, vNPU achieves up to a 2x performance improvement across various ML models, with only 2% hardware cost."
2506.11668,"The slow-down of technology scaling and the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads have led computer architects to increasingly exploit parallelization coupled with hardware acceleration to keep pushing the performance envelope. However, this solution comes with the challenge of synchronization of processing elements (PEs) in massive heterogeneous many-core platforms. To address this challenge, we propose FractalSync, a hardware accelerated synchronization mechanism for Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) systems. We integrate FractalSync in MAGIA, a scalable tile-based AI accelerator, with each tile featuring a RISC-V-coupled matrix-multiplication (MatMul) accelerator, scratchpad memory (SPM), and a DMA connected to a global mesh Network-on-Chip (NoC). We study the scalability of the proposed barrier synchronization scheme on tile meshes ranging from 2x2 PEs to 16x16 PEs to evaluate its design boundaries. Compared to a synchronization scheme based on software atomic memory operations (AMOs), the proposed solution achieves up to 43x speedup on synchronization, introducing a negligible area overhead (<0.01%). FractalSync closes timing at MAGIA's target 1GHz frequency."
2506.11925,"Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely."
2506.12359,"Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is widely accepted for ensuring secure data exchange between resource-limited IoT devices. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommended implementation, such as B-163, is particularly well-suited for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Here, Elliptic Curve Point Multiplication (ECPM) is the most time-critical and resource-intensive operation due to the finite field multiplier. This paper proposes a new implementation method of finite field multiplication using a hybrid Karatsuba multiplier, which achieves a significant improvement in computation time while maintaining a reasonable area footprint. The proposed multiplier, along with a finite field adder, squarer, and extended Euclidean inversion circuit, is used to implement an architecture for ECPM using the Montgomery algorithm. The architecture is evaluated for $GF(2^{163})$ on the Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA platform, achieving a maximum frequency of 213~MHz and occupying 14,195 Lookup Tables (LUTs).

2506.12947,"Processing-using-DRAM (PuD) is a promising paradigm for alleviating the data movement bottleneck using DRAM's massive internal parallelism and bandwidth to execute very wide operations. Performing a PuD operation involves activating multiple DRAM rows in quick succession or simultaneously, i.e., multiple-row activation. Multiple-row activation is fundamentally different from conventional memory access patterns that activate one DRAM row at a time. However, repeatedly activating even one DRAM row (e.g., RowHammer) can induce bitflips in unaccessed DRAM rows because modern DRAM is subject to read disturbance. Unfortunately, no prior work investigates the effects of multiple-row activation on DRAM read disturbance.In this paper, we present the first characterization study of read disturbance effects of multiple-row activation-based PuD (which we call PuDHammer) using 316 real DDR4 DRAM chips from four major DRAM manufacturers. Our detailed characterization show that 1) PuDHammer significantly exacerbates the read disturbance vulnerability, causing up to 158.58x reduction in the minimum hammer count required to induce the first bitflip ($HC_{first}$), compared to RowHammer, 2) PuDHammer is affected by various operational conditions and parameters, 3) combining RowHammer with PuDHammer is more effective than using RowHammer alone to induce read disturbance error, e.g., doing so reduces $HC_{first}$ by 1.66x on average, and 4) PuDHammer bypasses an in-DRAM RowHammer mitigation mechanism (Target Row Refresh) and induces more bitflips than RowHammer.To develop future robust PuD-enabled systems in the presence of PuDHammer, we 1) develop three countermeasures and 2) adapt and evaluate the state-of-the-art RowHammer mitigation standardized by industry, called Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC). We show that the adapted PRAC incurs large performance overheads (48.26%, on average)."

2506.13905,"Despite recent progress in generating hardware RTL code with LLMs, existing solutions still suffer from a substantial gap between practical application scenarios and the requirements of real-world RTL code development. Prior approaches either focus on overly simplified hardware descriptions or depend on extensive human guidance to process complex specifications, limiting their scalability and automation potential. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an LLM agent system, termed Spec2RTL-Agent, designed to directly process complex specification documentation and generate corresponding RTL code implementations, advancing LLM-based RTL code generation toward more realistic application settings. To achieve this goal, Spec2RTL-Agent introduces a novel multi-agent collaboration framework that integrates three key enablers: (1) a reasoning and understanding module that translates specifications into structured, step-by-step implementation plans; (2) a progressive coding and prompt optimization module that iteratively refines the code across multiple representations to enhance correctness and synthesisability for RTL conversion; and (3) an adaptive reflection module that identifies and traces the source of errors during generation, ensuring a more robust code generation flow. Instead of directly generating RTL from natural language, our system strategically generates synthesizable C++ code, which is then optimized for HLS. This agent-driven refinement ensures greater correctness and compatibility compared to naive direct RTL generation approaches. We evaluate Spec2RTL-Agent on three specification documents, showing it generates accurate RTL code with up to 75% fewer human interventions than existing methods. This highlights its role as the first fully automated multi-agent system for RTL generation from unstructured specs, reducing reliance on human effort in hardware design."

2506.1544,"Developing accurate and reliable Compute-In-Memory (CIM) architectures is becoming a key research focus to accelerate Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks on hardware, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In that regard, there has been significant interest in analog and mixed-signal CIM architectures aimed at increasing the efficiency of data storage and computation to handle the massive amount of data needed by DNNs. Specifically, resistive mixed-signal CIM cores are pushed by recent progresses in emerging Non-Volatile Memory (eNVM) solutions. Yet, mixed-signal CIM computing cores still face several integration and reliability challenges that hinder their large-scale adoption into end-to-end AI computing systems. In terms of integration, resistive and eNVM-based CIM cores need to be integrated with a control processor to realize end-to-end AI acceleration. Moreover, SRAM-based CIM architectures are still more efficient and easier to program than their eNVM counterparts. In terms of reliability, analog circuits are more susceptible to variations, leading to computation errors and degraded accuracy. This work addresses these two challenges by proposing a self-calibrated mixed-signal CIM accelerator SoC, fabricated in 22-nm FDSOI technology. The integration is facilitated by (1) the CIM architecture, combining the density and ease of SRAM-based weight storage with multi-bit computation using linear resistors, and (2) an open-source programming and testing strategy for CIM systems.

2506.15697,"The integration of large language models (LLMs) into electronic design automation (EDA) has significantly advanced the field, offering transformative benefits, particularly in register transfer level (RTL) code generation and understanding. While previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of fine-tuning LLMs for these generation-based tasks, embedding-based tasks, which are equally critical to EDA workflows, have been largely overlooked. These tasks, including natural language code search, RTL code functionality equivalence checking, and performance prediction, are essential for accelerating and optimizing the hardware design process. To address this gap, we present DeepRTL2, a family of versatile LLMs that unifies both generation- and embedding-based tasks related to RTL. By simultaneously tackling a broad range of tasks, DeepRTL2 represents the first model to provide a comprehensive solution to the diverse challenges in EDA. Through extensive experiments, we show that DeepRTL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks."
2506.15985,"Temporal prefetching shows promise for handling irregular memory access patterns, which are common in data-dependent and pointer-based data structures. Recent studies introduced on-chip metadata storage to reduce the memory traffic caused by accessing metadata from off-chip DRAM. However, existing prefetching schemes struggle to efficiently utilize the limited on-chip storage. An alternative solution, software indirect access prefetching, remains ineffective for optimizing temporal prefetching.In this work, we propose Prophet--a hardware-software co-designed framework that leverages profile-guided methods to optimize metadata storage management. Prophet profiles programs using counters instead of traces, injects hints into programs to guide metadata storage management, and dynamically tunes these hints to enable the optimized binary to adapt to different program inputs. Prophet is designed to coexist with existing hardware temporal prefetchers, delivering efficient, high-performance solutions for frequently executed workloads while preserving the original runtime scheme for less frequently executed workloads. Prophet outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal prefetcher, Triangel, by 14.23%, effectively addressing complex temporal patterns where prior profile-guided solutions fall short (only achieving 0.1% performance gain). Prophet delivers superior performance across all evaluated workload inputs, introducing negligible profiling, analysis, and instruction overhead."

We propose hetGPU, a new system comprising a compiler, runtime, and abstraction layer that together enable a single GPU binary to execute on NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Tenstorrent hardware. The hetGPU compiler emits an architecture-agnostic GPU intermediate representation (IR) and inserts metadata for managing execution state. The hetGPU runtime then dynamically translates this IR to the target GPU's native code and provides a uniform abstraction of threads, memory, and synchronization. Our design tackles key challenges: differing SIMT vs. MIMD execution (warps on NVIDIA/AMD vs. many-core RISC-V on Tenstorrent), varied instruction sets, scheduling and memory model discrepancies, and the need for state serialization for live migration. We detail the hetGPU architecture, including the IR transformation pipeline, a state capture/reload mechanism for live GPU migration, and an abstraction layer that bridges warp-centric and core-centric designs. Preliminary evaluation demonstrates that unmodified GPU binaries compiled with hetGPU can be migrated across disparate GPUs with minimal overhead, opening the door to vendor-agnostic GPU computing."

Heterogeneous architectures, combining specialized processing elements (PEs), have emerged as a key solution for achieving the required performance and energy efficiency. However, optimizing energy while executing applications on these platforms requires efficiently managing platform resources like PEs, power features, and memory footprint, all while adhering to critical application deadlines. This paper presents MEDEA, a novel design-time multi-objective manager for energy-efficient DNN inference on Heterogeneous ULP (HULP) platforms. MEDEA uniquely integrates: kernel-level dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) for dynamic energy adaptation; kernel-level granularity scheduling, suitable for specialized accelerators; memory-aware adaptive tiling to navigate severe memory constraints; and all within a timing constraint-based optimization strategy, which minimizes energy based on application deadline. To showcase practical viability, we evaluate MEDEA on HEEPtimize, a heterogeneous ULP platform (22 nm, FPGA-prototyped) featuring a RISC-V processor besides Near-Memory Computing (NMC) and Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) accelerators. Experimental results, using a biomedical seizure detection case study, demonstrate that MEDEA achieves overall energy reductions of up to 38% compared to representative state-of-the-art methods, while consistently meeting all timing and memory requirements.

2506.21414,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in graph learning and are widely adopted across various critical domains. However, the irregular connectivity between vertices leads to inefficient neighbor aggregation, resulting in substantial irregular and coarse-grained DRAM accesses. This lack of data locality presents significant challenges for execution platforms, ultimately degrading performance. While previous accelerator designs have leveraged on-chip memory and data access scheduling strategies to address this issue, they still inevitably access features at irregular addresses from DRAM. In this work, we propose LiGNN, a hardware-based solution that improves data locality by applying dropout and merge techniques during neighbor aggregation to accelerate GNN training. Unlike conventional algorithm-level dropout methods that primarily aim to improve accuracy while overlooking hardware costs, LiGNN introduces a locality-aware feature dropout mechanism. This approach selectively drops node features with data locality awareness, effectively reducing irregular DRAM accesses without compromising model accuracy. Moreover, by leveraging detailed knowledge of memory layout and organization-including critical alignment constraints-LiGNN strategically merges memory accesses during neighbor aggregation at the DRAM row level, guided by GNN-level semantics. This optimization significantly improves data locality with minimal additional cost. Under the commonly adopted 0.5 dropout rate, LiGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering a 1.48~3.02x speedup, reducing DRAM accesses by 34%~55%, and lowering DRAM row activations by 59%~82%, all while maintaining model accuracy."

Next, based on the proposed optimized algorithm, the sensitizer gate (which drives the critical node) and the sensitive gate (which is fed by it) are merged into a new complex gate. This complex gate preserves the original logic while eliminating NBTI-critical nodes. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of OptGM, we assess it on several combinational and sequential benchmark circuits.

However, the deterministic nature of the existing models fail to account for the spatial and temporal variability in the semiconductor supply chain. The absence of uncertainty modeling limits system designers' ability to make informed, carbon-aware decisions. We introduce CarbonClarity, a probabilistic framework designed to model embodied carbon footprints through distributions that reflect uncertainties in energy-per-area, gas-per-area, yield, and carbon intensity across different technology nodes. Our framework enables a deeper understanding of how design choices, such as chiplet architectures and new vs. old technology node selection, impact emissions and their associated uncertainties. For example, we show that the gap between the mean and 95th percentile of embodied carbon per cm$^2$ can reach up to 1.6X for the 7nm technology node. Additionally, we demonstrate through case studies that: (i) CarbonClarity is a valuable resource for device provisioning, help maintaining performance under a tight carbon budget; and (ii) chiplet technology and mature nodes not only reduce embodied carbon but also significantly lower its associated uncertainty, achieving an 18% reduction in the 95th percentile compared to monolithic designs for the mobile application."

A bottleneck for the deployment of such neural networks is area utilization, which is directly related to the required constant matrix-vector multiplication (CMVM) operations. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for implementing CMVM operations with distributed arithmetic (DA) on FPGAs that simultaneously optimizes for area consumption and latency. The algorithm achieves resource reduction similar to state-of-the-art algorithms while being significantly faster to compute. The proposed algorithm is open-sourced and integrated into the \texttt{hls4ml} library, a free and open-source library for running real-time neural network inference on FPGAs. We show that the proposed algorithm can reduce on-chip resources by up to a third for realistic, highly quantized neural networks while simultaneously reducing latency, enabling the implementation of previously infeasible networks."
2507.04677,"In recent years, new methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) such as Monte Carlo random walk methods have gained considerable attention. However, due to the lack of hardware-intrinsic randomness in the conventional von Neumann architecture, the performance of PDE solvers is limited. In this paper, we introduce NeuroPDE, a hardware design for neuromorphic PDE solvers that utilizes emerging spintronic and ferroelectric devices. NeuroPDE incorporates spin neurons that are capable of probabilistic transmission to emulate random walks, along with ferroelectric synapses that store continuous weights non-volatilely. The proposed NeuroPDE achieves a variance of less than 1e-2 compared to analytical solutions when solving diffusion equations, demonstrating a performance advantage of 3.48x to 315x speedup in execution time and an energy consumption advantage of 2.7x to 29.8x over advanced CMOS-based neuromorphic chips. By leveraging the inherent physical stochasticity of emerging devices, this study paves the way for future probabilistic neuromorphic computing systems."
2507.04772,"In this work, we introduce an area- and energy-efficient multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit, named Jack unit, that is a jack-of-all-trades, supporting various data formats such as integer (INT), floating point (FP), and microscaling data format (MX). It provides bit-level flexibility and enhances hardware efficiency by i) replacing the carry-save multiplier (CSM) in the FP multiplier with a precision-scalable CSM, ii) performing the adjustment of significands based on the exponent differences within the CSM, and iii) utilizing 2D sub-word parallelism. To assess effectiveness, we implemented the layout of the Jack unit and three baseline MAC units. Additionally, we designed an AI accelerator equipped with our Jack units to compare with a state-of-the-art AI accelerator supporting various data formats. The proposed MAC unit occupies 1.17~2.01x smaller area and consumes 1.05~1.84x lower power compared to the baseline MAC units. On five AI benchmarks, the accelerator designed with our Jack units improves energy efficiency by 1.32~5.41x over the baseline across various data formats."
2507.05012,"Next-generation wireless technologies (for immersive-massive communication, joint communication and sensing) demand highly parallel architectures for massive data processing. A common architectural template scales up by grouping tens to hundreds of cores into shared-memory clusters, which are then scaled out as multi-cluster manycore systems. This hierarchical design, used in GPUs and accelerators, requires a balancing act between fewer large clusters and more smaller clusters, affecting design complexity, synchronization, communication efficiency, and programmability. While all multi-cluster architectures must balance these trade-offs, there is limited insight into optimal cluster sizes. This paper analyzes various cluster configurations, focusing on synchronization, data movement overhead, and programmability for typical wireless sensing and communication workloads. We extend the open-source shared-memory cluster MemPool into a multi-cluster architecture and propose a novel double-buffering barrier that decouples processor and DMA. Our results show a single 256-core cluster can be twice as fast as 16 16-core clusters for memory-bound kernels and up to 24% faster for compute-bound kernels due to reduced synchronization and communication overheads."
2507.05081,"Vibration energy harvesting is a promising solution for powering battery-free IoT systems; however, the instability of ambient vibrations presents significant challenges, such as limited harvested energy, intermittent power supply, and poor adaptability to various applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes ViPSN2.0, a modular and reconfigurable IoT platform that supports multiple vibration energy harvesters (piezoelectric, electromagnetic, and triboelectric) and accommodates sensing tasks with varying application requirements through standardized hot-swappable interfaces. ViPSN~2.0 incorporates an energy-indication power management framework tailored to various application demands, including light-duty discrete sampling, heavy-duty high-power sensing, and complex-duty streaming tasks, thereby effectively managing fluctuating energy availability. The platform's versatility and robustness are validated through three representative applications: ViPSN-Beacon, enabling ultra-low-power wireless beacon transmission from a single transient fingertip press; ViPSN-LoRa, supporting high-power, long-range wireless communication powered by wave vibrations in actual marine environments; and ViPSN-Cam, enabling intermittent image capture and wireless transfer. Experimental results demonstrate that ViPSN~2.0 can reliably meet a wide range of requirements in practical battery-free IoT deployments under energy-constrained conditions."
2507.05556,"Per-Row Activation Counting (PRAC), a DRAM read disturbance mitigation method, modifies key DRAM timing parameters, reportedly causing significant performance overheads in simulator-based studies. However, given known discrepancies between simulators and real hardware, real-machine experiments are vital for accurate PRAC performance estimation. We present the first real-machine performance analysis of PRAC. After verifying timing modifications on the latest CPUs using microbenchmarks, our analysis shows that PRAC's average and maximum overheads are just 1.06% and 3.28% for the SPEC CPU2017 workloads -- up to 9.15x lower than simulator-based reports. Further, we show that the close page policy minimizes this overhead by effectively hiding the elongated DRAM row precharge operations due to PRAC from the critical path."
2507.05681,"Clock meshes are essential in high-performance VLSI systems for minimizing skew and handling PVT variations, but analyzing them is difficult due to reconvergent paths, multi-source driving, and input mesh buffer skew.

We propose GATMesh, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework that models the clock mesh as a graph with augmented structural and physical features.

2507.06069,"In this work, we survey the role of GPUs in real-time systems. Originally designed for parallel graphics workloads, GPUs are now widely used in time-critical applications such as machine learning, autonomous vehicles, and robotics due to their high computational throughput. Their parallel architecture is well-suited for accelerating complex tasks under strict timing constraints. However, their integration into real-time systems presents several challenges, including non-preemptive execution, execution time variability, and resource contention; factors that can lead to unpredictable delays and deadline violations. We examine existing solutions that address these challenges, including scheduling algorithms, resource management techniques, and synchronization methods, and highlight open research directions to improve GPU predictability and performance in real-time environments."
2507.06127,"Prefix adders are fundamental arithmetic circuits, but their design space grows exponentially with bit-width, posing significant optimization challenges. Previous works face limitations in performance, generalization, and scalability. To address these challenges, we propose PrefixAgent, a large language model (LLM)-powered framework that enables efficient prefix adder optimization. Specifically, PrefixAgent reformulates the problem into subtasks including backbone synthesis and structure refinement, which effectively reduces the search space. More importantly, this new design perspective enables us to efficiently collect enormous high-quality data and reasoning traces with E-graph, which further results in an effective fine-tuning of LLM. Experimental results show that PrefixAgent synthesizes prefix adders with consistently smaller areas compared to baseline methods, while maintaining scalability and generalization in commercial EDA flows."
2507.06376,"Over the last few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a valuable tool for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). State-of-the-art research in LLM-aided design has demonstrated the ability of LLMs to generate syntactically correct RTL code, showcasing encouraging prospects for integrating AI into the hardware design process. A key enabler of these advancements is the availability of high-quality benchmarks to evaluate new approaches. However, existing datasets and benchmarks fall short of system-level design, as they focus primarily on component-level information and low-complexity designs. To address this gap, we introduce the System-Level Design Benchmark (SLDB), a dataset tailored for evaluating LLMs in system-level integration and configuration tasks. SLDB includes a curated benchmark suite of 10 baseline SoC designs, whose components can be combined into an exponential number of distinct tile-based SoCs through a synthetic library. The dataset provides full SoC configurations, accelerator integration code, communication parameters, and accelerator-aware system configurations, along with testing-application code, compatible with the ESP platform[1]."

In this work, we explore how LLMs can assist with explaining the root cause of design issues and bugs that are revealed during synthesis and simulation, a necessary milestone on the pathway towards widespread use of LLMs in the hardware design process and for hardware security analysis. We find promising results: for our corpus of 34 different buggy scenarios, OpenAI's o3-mini reasoning model reached a correct determination 100% of the time under pass@5 scoring, with other state of the art models and configurations usually achieving more than 80% performance and more than 90% when assisted with retrieval-augmented generation."
2507.07044,"Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a powerful architecture for computer vision tasks due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and global contextual relationships. However, their substantial compute and memory demands hinder efficient deployment in scenarios with strict energy and bandwidth limitations. In this work, we propose OptoViT, the first near-sensor, region-aware ViT accelerator leveraging silicon photonics (SiPh) for real-time and energy-efficient vision processing. Opto-ViT features a hybrid electronic-photonic architecture, where the optical core handles compute-intensive matrix multiplications using Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) and Microring Resonators (MRs), while nonlinear functions and normalization are executed electronically. To reduce redundant computation and patch processing, we introduce a lightweight Mask Generation Network (MGNet) that identifies regions of interest in the current frame and prunes irrelevant patches before ViT encoding. We further co-optimize the ViT backbone using quantization-aware training and matrix decomposition tailored for photonic constraints. Experiments across device fabrication, circuit and architecture co-design, to classification, detection, and video tasks demonstrate that OptoViT achieves 100.4 KFPS/W with up to 84% energy savings with less than 1.6% accuracy loss, while enabling scalable and efficient ViT deployment at the edge."
2507.07683,"Transposed Convolutions (TCONV) enable the up-scaling mechanism within generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. However, the predominant Input-Oriented Mapping (IOM) method for implementing TCONV has complex output mapping, overlapping sums, and ineffectual computations. These inefficiencies further exacerbate the performance bottleneck of TCONV and generative models on resource-constrained edge devices. To address this problem, in this paper we propose MM2IM, a hardware-software co-designed accelerator that combines Matrix Multiplication (MatMul) with col2IM to process TCONV layers on resource-constrained edge devices efficiently. Using the SECDA-TFLite design toolkit, we implement MM2IM and evaluate its performance across 261 TCONV problem configurations, achieving an average speedup of 1.9x against a dual-thread ARM Neon optimized CPU baseline. We then evaluate the performance of MM2IM on a range of TCONV layers from well-known generative models achieving up to 4.2x speedup, and compare it against similar resource-constrained TCONV accelerators, outperforming them by at least 2x GOPs/DSP. Finally, we evaluate MM2IM on the DCGAN and pix2pix GAN models, achieving up to 3x speedup and 2.4x energy reduction against the CPU baseline."
2507.08406,"As transistor counts in a single chip exceed tens of billions, the complexity of RTL-level simulation and verification has grown exponentially, often extending simulation campaigns to several months. In industry practice, RTL simulation is divided into two phases: functional debug and system validation. While system validation demands high simulation speed and is typically accelerated using FPGAs, functional debug relies on rapid compilation-rendering multi-core CPUs the primary choice. However, the limited simulation speed of CPUs has become a major bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose CCSS, a scalable multi-core RTL simulation platform that achieves both fast compilation and high simulation throughput. CCSS accelerates combinational logic computation and sequential logic synchronization through specialized architecture and compilation strategies. It employs a balanced DAG partitioning method and efficient boolean computation cores for combinational logic, and adopts a low-latency network-on-chip (NoC) design to synchronize sequential states across cores efficiently. Experimental results show that CCSS delivers up to 12.9x speedup over state-of-the-art multi-core simulators."
2507.08658,"A new set of hardware merge sort devices are introduced here, which merge multiple sorted input lists into a single sorted output list in a fast and efficient manner. In each merge sorter, the values from the sorted input lists are arranged in an input 2-D setup array, but with the order of each sorted input list offset from the order of each of the other sorted input lists. In these new devices, called List Offset Merge Sorters (LOMS), a minimal set of column sort stages alternating with row sort stages process the input setup array into a final output array, now in the defined sorted order. LOMS 2-way sorters, which merge 2 sorted input lists, require only 2 merge stages and are significantly faster than Kenneth Batcher's previous state-of-the-art 2-way merge devices, Bitonic Merge Sorters and Odd-Even Merge Sorters. LOMS 2-way sorters utilize the recently-introduced Single-Stage 2-way Merge Sorters (S2MS) in their first stage. Both LOMS and S2MS devices can merge any mixture of input list sizes, while Batcher's merge sorters are difficult to design unless the 2 input lists are equal, and a power-of-2. By themselves, S2MS devices are the fastest 2-way merge sorters when implemented in this study's target FPGA devices, but they tend to use a large number of LUT resources. LOMS 2-way devices use fewer resources than comparable S2MS devices, enabling some large LOMS devices to be implemented in a given FPGA when comparable S2MS devices cannot fit in that FPGA. A List Offset 2-way sorter merges 2 lists, each with 32 values, into a sorted output list of those 64 values in 2.24 nS, a speedup of 2.63 versus a comparable Batcher device. A LOMS 3-way merge sorter, merging 3 sorted input lists with 7 values, fully merges the 21 values in 3.4 nS, a speedup of 1.36 versus the comparable state-of-the-art 3-way merge device."
2507.08923,"The rapid growth of data centers is increasing energy demand and widening the carbon gap in the ICT sector, as fossil fuels still dominate global energy production. Addressing this challenge requires collaboration across research, policy, and industry to rethink how computing infrastructures are designed and scaled sustainably. This work addresses central trade-offs in procurement decisions that affect carbon emissions, economic costs, and scaling of compute resources. We present these factors in a holistic decision-making framework for Carbon and Economy Optimization in Data Centers (CEO-DC). CEO-DC introduces new carbon and price metrics that enable DC managers, platform designers, and policymakers to make informed decisions. Applying CEO-DC to current trends in AI and HPC reveals that, in 72% of the cases, platform improvements lag behind demand growth. Moreover, prioritizing energy efficiency over latency can reduce the economic appeal of sustainable designs. Our analysis shows that in many countries with electricity with medium to high carbon intensity, replacing platforms older than four years could reduce their projected emissions by at least 75%. However, current carbon incentives worldwide remain insufficient to steer data center procurement strategies toward sustainable goals. In summary, our findings underscore the need for a shift in hardware design and faster grid decarbonization to ensure sustainability and technological viability."
2507.0901,"Edge inference for large language models (LLM) offers secure, low-latency, and cost-effective inference solutions. We emphasize that an edge accelerator should achieve high area efficiency and minimize external memory access (EMA) during the memory-bound decode stage, while maintaining high energy efficiency during the compute intensive prefill stage. This paper proposes an edge LLM inference accelerator featuring a hybrid systolic array (HSA) architecture that optimizes inference efficiency in both stages. To further reduce EMA, we adopt MXINT4 weight quantization and propose an optimized dataflow tailored for HSA, ensuring negligible dequantization overhead and achieving 100% hardware utilization with minimal accuracy loss under edge DRAM bandwidth constraints. For non-linear operations, we incorporate optimized root mean square normalization (RMSNorm) and rotary position embedding (RoPE) units, reducing their latency, area, and memory access overhead while enabling end-to-end inference on our accelerator. Our solution achieves 247/117 (token/s/mm2) while running a 1.3B LLM on long-input/long-output scenarios, providing >2.45x/13.5x improvement over existing approaches, while maintaining superior energy efficiency in token generation."
2507.09201,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in understanding and generating human language, but efficient inference on resource-constrained embedded devices remains challenging due to large model sizes and memory-intensive operations in feedforward network (FFN) and multi-head attention (MHA) layers. While existing accelerators offload LLM inference to expensive heterogeneous computing systems, they fail to exploit the significant sparsity inherent in LLM operations, leaving hardware resources underutilized. We propose SLIM, an algorithm-hardware co-design optimized for sparse LLM serving on edge devices. SLIM exploits LLM sparsity through an adaptive thresholding algorithm that enables runtime-configurable sparsity with negligible accuracy loss, fetching only activated neurons to dramatically reduce data movement. Our heterogeneous hardware architecture strategically combines near-storage processing (NSP) and processing-in-memory (PIM): FFN weights are stored in high-density 3D NAND and computed using NSP units, while memory-intensive MHA operations are processed in PIM modules. This design significantly reduces memory footprint, data movement, and energy consumption. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates SLIM's effectiveness, achieving 13-18x throughput improvements over SSD-GPU systems and 9-10x better energy efficiency over DRAM-GPU systems while maintaining low latency, making cost-effective LLM deployment viable for edge computing environments."
2507.0966,"System-level design, once the province of board designers, has now become a central concern for chip designers. Because chip design is a less forgiving design medium -- design cycles are longer and mistakes are harder to correct -- system-on-chip designers need a more extensive tool suite than may be used by board designers and a variety of tools and methodologies have been developed for system-level design of systems-on-chips (SoCs). System-level design is less amenable to synthesis than are logic or physical design. As a result, system-level tools concentrate on modeling, simulation, design space exploration, and design verification. The goal of modeling is to correctly capture the system's operational semantics, which helps with both implementation and verification. The study of models of computation provides a framework for the description of digital systems. Not only do we need to understand a particular style of computation, such as dataflow, but we also need to understand how different models of computation can reliably communicate with each other. Design space exploration tools, such as hardware/software co-design, develop candidate designs to understand trade-offs. Simulation can be used not only to verify functional correctness but also to supply performance and power/energy information for design analysis. This chapter employs two applications -- video and neural networks -- as examples. Both are leading-edge applications that illustrate many important aspects of system-level design."
2507.0973,"The accuracy of floating-random-walk (FRW) based capacitance extraction stands only when the recursive FRW transitions are sampled unbiasedly according to surrounding dielectrics. Advanced technology profiles, featuring complicated non-stratified dielectrics, challenge the accuracy of existing FRW transition schemes that approximate dielectrics with stratified or eight-octant patterns. In this work, we propose an algorithm named MicroWalk, enabling accurate FRW transitions for arbitrary dielectrics while keeping high efficiency. It is provably unbiased and equivalent to using transition probabilities solved by finite difference method, but at orders of magnitude lower cost (802$\times$ faster). An enhanced 3-D capacitance solver is developed with a hybrid strategy for complicated dielectrics, combining MicroWalk with the special treatment for the first transition cube and the analytical algorithm for stratified cubes. Experiments on real-world structures show that our solver achieves a significant accuracy advantage over existing FRW solvers, while preserving high efficiency."
2507.09774,"This paper presents the design and development of a low-cost fuel dispensing system prototype based on the STM32 microcontroller and L298N motor driver. The system aims to provide an affordable and scalable solution for fuel delivery in remote or small-scale environments where conventional, high-cost systems are not feasible. The core control unit is built using an STM32 microcontroller, which manages user input through a 4x4 matrix keypad and displays operational data on a 16x4 LCD screen via I2C communication. A 12V DC pump motor is used to simulate the fuel dispensing mechanism, precisely controlled via the dual H-bridge L298N motor driver. The system is powered by a 11.1V battery and is designed for ease of deployment and portability. The keypad allows users to input the desired fuel amount, while the system ensures accurate motor runtime corresponding to the volume to be dispensed. This project demonstrates how embedded systems can be leveraged to build cost-effective, user-friendly, and energy-efficient solutions. The proposed design can be further enhanced with flow sensors, GSM connectivity, RFID cards, and payment integration for real-world applications in fuel stations or agricultural use."
2507.0978,"Bit-level sparsity in quantized deep neural networks (DNNs) offers significant potential for optimizing Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. However, two key challenges still limit its practical exploitation. First, conventional bit-serial approaches cannot simultaneously leverage the sparsity of both factors, leading to a complete waste of one factor' s sparsity. Methods designed to exploit dual-factor sparsity are still in the early stages of exploration, facing the challenge of partial product explosion. Second, the fluctuation of bit-level sparsity leads to variable cycle counts for MAC operations. Existing synchronous scheduling schemes that are suitable for dual-factor sparsity exhibit poor flexibility and still result in significant underutilization of MAC units. To address the first challenge, this study proposes a MAC unit that leverages dual-factor sparsity through the emerging particlization-based approach. The proposed design addresses the issue of partial product explosion through simple control logic, resulting in a more area- and energy-efficient MAC unit. In addition, by discarding less significant intermediate results, the design allows for further hardware simplification at the cost of minor accuracy loss. To address the second challenge, a quasi-synchronous scheme is introduced that adds cycle-level elasticity to the MAC array, reducing pipeline stalls and thereby improving MAC unit utilization. Evaluation results show that the exact version of the proposed MAC array architecture achieves a 29.2% improvement in area efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art bit-sparsity-driven architecture, while maintaining comparable energy efficiency. The approximate variant further improves energy efficiency by 7.5%, compared to the exact version. Index-Terms: DNN acceleration, Bit-level sparsity, MAC unit"
2507.10178,"Transformers are the driving force behind today's Large Language Models (LLMs), serving as the foundation for their performance and versatility. Yet, their compute and memory costs grow with sequence length, posing scalability challenges for long-context inferencing. In response, the algorithm community is exploring alternative architectures, such as state space models (SSMs), linear attention, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which we refer to as post-transformers. This shift presents a key challenge: building a serving system that efficiently supports both transformer and post-transformer LLMs within a unified framework. To address this challenge, we analyze the performance characteristics of transformer and post-transformer LLMs. Despite their algorithmic differences, both are fundamentally limited by memory bandwidth under batched inference due to attention in transformers and state updates in post-transformers. Further analyses suggest two additional insights: (1) state update operations, unlike attention, incur high hardware cost, making per-bank PIM acceleration inefficient, and (2) different low-precision arithmetic methods offer varying accuracy-area tradeoffs, while we identify Microsoft's MX as the Pareto-optimal choice. Building on these insights, we design Pimba as an array of State-update Processing Units (SPUs), each shared between two banks to enable interleaved access to PIM. Each SPU includes a State-update Processing Engine (SPE) that comprises element-wise multipliers and adders using MX-based quantized arithmetic, enabling efficient execution of state update and attention operations. Our evaluation shows that, compared to LLM-optimized GPU and GPU+PIM systems, Pimba achieves up to 4.1x and 2.1x higher token generation throughput, respectively."

However, it is unclear to what extent they can assist in the design process of electronic circuits. This paper focuses on the application of LLMs to switched-mode power supply (SMPS) design for printed circuit boards (PCBs). We present multiple LLM-based workflows that combine reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a custom toolkit that enables the LLM to interact with SPICE simulations to estimate the impact of circuit modifications. Two benchmark experiments are presented to analyze the performance of LLM-based assistants for different design tasks, including parameter tuning, topology adaption and optimization of SMPS circuits. Experiment results show that SPICE simulation feedback and current LLM advancements, such as reasoning, significantly increase the solve rate on 269 manually created benchmark tasks from 15% to 91%.

2507.10748,"Neuromorphic systems using in-memory or event-driven computing are motivated by the need for more energy-efficient processing of artificial intelligence workloads. Emerging neuromorphic architectures aim to combine traditional digital designs with the computational efficiency of analog computing and novel device technologies. A crucial problem in the rapid exploration and co-design of such architectures is the lack of tools for fast and accurate modeling and simulation. Typical mixed-signal design tools integrate a digital simulator with an analog solver like SPICE, which is prohibitively slow for large systems. By contrast, behavioral modeling of analog components is faster, but existing approaches are fixed to specific architectures with limited energy and performance modeling. In this paper, we propose LASANA, a novel approach that leverages machine learning to derive data-driven surrogate models of analog sub-blocks in a digital backend architecture. LASANA uses SPICE-level simulations of a circuit to train ML models that predict circuit energy, performance, and behavior at analog/digital interfaces. Such models can provide energy and performance annotation on top of existing behavioral models or function as replacements to analog simulation. We apply LASANA to an analog crossbar array and a spiking neuron circuit. Running MNIST and spiking MNIST, LASANA surrogates demonstrate up to three orders of magnitude speedup over SPICE, with energy, latency, and behavioral error less than 7%, 8%, and 2%, respectively."
2507.10849,"Gain Cell memory (GCRAM) offers higher density and lower power than SRAM, making it a promising candidate for on-chip memory in domain-specific accelerators. To support workloads with varying traffic and lifetime metrics, GCRAM also offers high bandwidth, ultra low leakage power and a wide range of retention times, which can be adjusted through transistor design (like threshold voltage and channel material) and on-the-fly by changing the operating voltage. However, designing and optimizing GCRAM sub-systems can be time-consuming. In this paper, we present OpenGCRAM, an open-source GCRAM compiler capable of generating GCRAM bank circuit designs and DRC- and LVS-clean layouts for commercially available foundry CMOS, while also providing area, delay, and power simulations based on user-specified configurations (e.g., word size and number of words).

2507.10912,"LUT (Look-Up Table) mapping is a critical step in FPGA logic synthesis, where a logic network is transformed into a form that can be directly implemented using the FPGA's LUTs. An FPGA LUT is a flexible digital memory structure that can implement any logic function of a limited number of inputs, typically 4 to 6 inputs, depending on the FPGA architecture. The goal of LUT mapping is to map the Boolean network into LUTs, where each LUT can implement any function with a fixed number of inputs. In parallel to FPGA technology mapping, ASIC technology mapping maps the Boolean network to user-defined standard cells, which has traditionally been developed separately from LUT mapping algorithms. However, in this work, our motivating examples demonstrate that ASIC technology mappers can potentially improve the performance of LUT mappers, such that standard cell mapping and LUT mapping work in an incremental manner.Therefore, we propose the FuseMap framework, which explores this opportunity to improve LUT mapping in the FPGA design flow by utilizing reinforcement learning to make design-specific choices during cell selection. The effectiveness of FuseMap is evaluated on a wide range of benchmarks, different technology libraries, and technology mappers. The experimental results demonstrate that FuseMap achieves higher mapping accuracy while reducing delay and area across diverse circuit designs collected from ISCAS 85/89, ITC/ISCAS 99, VTR 8.0, and EPFL benchmarks."
2507.10971,"Designing secure architectures for system-on-chip (SoC) platforms is a highly intricate and time-intensive task, often requiring months of development and meticulous verification. Even minor architectural oversights can lead to critical vulnerabilities that undermine the security of the entire chip. In response to this challenge, we introduce CITADEL, a modular security framework aimed at streamlining the creation of robust security architectures for SoCs. CITADEL offers a configurable, plug-and-play subsystem composed of custom intellectual property (IP) blocks, enabling the construction of diverse security mechanisms tailored to specific threats. As a concrete demonstration, we instantiate CITADEL to defend against supply-chain threats, illustrating how the framework adapts to one of the most pressing concerns in hardware security. This paper explores the range of obstacles encountered when building a unified security architecture capable of addressing multiple attack vectors and presents CITADEL's strategies for overcoming them. Through several real-world case studies, we showcase the practical implementation of CITADEL and present a thorough evaluation of its impact on silicon area and power consumption across various ASIC technologies.

2507.11331,"Transformer models rely heavily on scaled dot-product attention (SDPA), typically implemented using the FlashAttention algorithm. However, current systolic-array-based accelerators face significant challenges when executing FlashAttention. Systolic arrays achieve high utilization primarily for consecutive and large matrix multiplications, whereas FlashAttention requires frequent interleaving of matrix multiplications and softmax operations.The frequent data swaps between matrix multiplications on the systolic array and softmax operations on external units result in low array utilization. Moreover, when these computations run concurrently, the softmax stage contends with matrix multiplication for register file and SRAM ports, further degrading performance.To overcome these limitations, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array architecture that enables the FlashAttention algorithm to run entirely within a single systolic array, eliminating the need for external vector units. At the core of FSA is SystolicAttention, a novel scheduling algorithm that maps FlashAttention operations onto systolic arrays with fine-grained, element-wise overlap. This approach significantly improves array utilization while preserving the original floating-point operation order to maintain numerical stability.We implement FSA in synthesizable RTL and evaluate its performance against state-of-the-art commercial accelerators. Our results show that FSA achieves 1.77 and 4.83 times higher attention FLOPs/s utilization compared to AWS Neuron v2 and Google TPUv5e, respectively, with only 12% area overhead."
2507.11506,"To meet the increasing demand of deep learning (DL) models, AI chips are employing both off-chip memory (e.g., HBM) and high-bandwidth low-latency interconnect for direct inter-core data exchange. However, it is not easy to explore the efficiency of these inter-core connected AI (ICCA) chips, due to a fundamental tussle among compute (per-core execution), communication (inter-core data exchange), and I/O (off-chip data access).In this paper, we develop Elk, a DL compiler framework to maximize the efficiency of ICCA chips by jointly trading off all the three performance factors discussed above. Elk structures these performance factors into configurable parameters and forms a global trade-off space in the DL compiler. To systematically explore this space and maximize overall efficiency, Elk employs a new inductive operator scheduling policy and a cost-aware on-chip memory allocation algorithm. It generates globally optimized execution plans that best overlap off-chip data loading and on-chip execution. To examine the efficiency of Elk, we build a full-fledged emulator based on a real ICCA chip IPU-POD4, and an ICCA chip simulator for sensitivity analysis with different interconnect network topologies. Elk achieves 94% of the ideal roofline performance of ICCA chips on average, showing the benefits of supporting large DL models on ICCA chips. We also show Elk's capability of enabling architecture design space exploration for new ICCA chip development."
2507.11709,"Flexibility and customization are key strengths of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) when compared to other computing devices. For instance, FPGAs can efficiently implement arbitrary-precision arithmetic operations, and can perform aggressive synthesis optimizations to eliminate ineffectual operations. Motivated by sparsity and mixed-precision in deep neural networks (DNNs), we investigate how to optimize the current logic block architecture to increase its arithmetic density. We find that modern FPGA logic block architectures prevent the independent use of adder chains, and instead only allow adder chain inputs to be fed by look-up table (LUT) outputs. This only allows one of the two primitives -- either adders or LUTs -- to be used independently in one logic element and prevents their concurrent use, hampering area optimizations. In this work, we propose the Double Duty logic block architecture to enable the concurrent use of the adders and LUTs within a logic element. Without adding expensive logic cluster inputs, we use 4 of the existing inputs to bypass the LUTs and connect directly to the adder chain inputs. We accurately model our changes at both the circuit and CAD levels using open-source FPGA development tools. Our experimental evaluation on a Stratix-10-like architecture demonstrates area reductions of 21.6% on adder-intensive circuits from the Kratos benchmarks, and 9.3% and 8.2% on the more general Koios and VTR benchmarks respectively. These area improvements come without an impact to critical path delay, demonstrating that higher density is feasible on modern FPGA architectures by adding more flexibility in how the adder chain is used. Averaged across all circuits from our three evaluated benchmark set, our Double Duty FPGA architecture improves area-delay product by 9.7%."
2507.12028,"Task offloading in three-layer fog computing environments presents a critical challenge due to user equipment (UE) mobility, which frequently triggers costly service migrations and degrades overall system performance. This paper addresses this problem by proposing MOFCO, a novel Mobility- and Migration-aware Task Offloading algorithm for Fog Computing environments. The proposed method formulates task offloading and resource allocation as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and employs a heuristic-aided evolutionary game theory approach to solve it efficiently. To evaluate MOFCO, we simulate mobile users using SUMO, providing realistic mobility patterns. Experimental results show that MOFCO reduces system cost, defined as a combination of latency and energy consumption, by an average of 19% and up to 43% in certain scenarios compared to state-of-the-art methods."
2507.12418,"The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is a fundamental operation in privacy-preserving technologies, particularly within fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). The efficiency of NTT computation directly impacts the overall performance of FHE, making hardware acceleration a critical technology that will enable realistic FHE applications. Custom accelerators, in FPGAs or ASICs, offer significant performance advantages due to their ability to exploit massive parallelism and specialized optimizations. However, the operation of NTT over large moduli requires large word-length modulo arithmetic that limits achievable clock frequencies in hardware and increases hardware area costs. To overcome such deficits, digit-serial arithmetic has been explored for modular multiplication and addition independently. The goal of this work is to leverage digit-serial modulo arithmetic combined with appropriate redundant data representation to design modular pipelined NTT accelerators that operate uniformly on arbitrary small digits, without the need for intermediate (de)serialization. The proposed architecture enables high clock frequencies through regular pipelining while maintaining parallelism. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art implementations and reduces hardware complexity under equal performance and input-output bandwidth constraints."
2507.12442,"The demand for machine intelligence capable of processing continuous, long-context inputs on local devices is growing rapidly. However, the quadratic complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing sequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than comparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short sequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals that custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime, accounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a primary target for future hardware acceleration. We also provide detailed, device-specific characterization results to guide system co-design for the edge. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization framework."

In this paper we introduce modular SAIL, an experiment to inject compositionality into the SAIL-RISCV golden model. We show that it is, in principle, not difficult to adapt the SAIL-RISCV flow (and ideally the SAIL compiler itself) to support modules at the emulator level. We back our findings by a comparative study of the resulting pluggable emulator's performance using both static and dynamic binding, which both exhibit same functional behavior as the original monolithic emulator (aka RISC-V ISS)."
2507.12904,"Transformers have revolutionized deep learning with applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond.

2507.13355,"Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI)-driven electronic design and automation (EDA) tools, high-performance computing, and parallelized algorithms are essential for next-generation microprocessor innovation, ensuring continued progress in computing, AI, and semiconductor technology. Machine learning-based design rule checking (DRC) and lithography hotspot detection can improve first-pass silicon success. However, conventional ML and neural network (NN)-based models use supervised learning and require a large balanced dataset (in terms of positive and negative classes) and training time. This research addresses those key challenges by proposing the first-ever unsupervised DRC violation prediction methodology. The proposed model can be built using any unbalanced dataset using only one class and set a threshold for it, then fitting any new data querying if they are within the boundary of the model for classification. This research verified the proposed model by implementing different computational cores using CMOS 28 nm technology and Synopsys Design Compiler and IC Compiler II tools. Then, layouts were divided into virtual grids to collect about 60k data for analysis and verification. The proposed method has 99.95% prediction test accuracy, while the existing support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN) models have 85.44\% and 98.74\% accuracy, respectively.

2507.13369,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining popularity for hardware design automation, particularly through Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. In this work, we examine the current literature on RTL generation using LLMs and identify key requirements for training and fine-tuning datasets. We construct a robust Verilog dataset through an automated three-pronged process involving database (DB) creation and management with PostgreSQL, data collection from code hosting sites like OpenCores and GitHub, and data preprocessing to verify the codes' syntax, run logic synthesis, and extract relevant module metadata. We implement a scalable and efficient DB infrastructure to support analysis and detail our preprocessing pipeline to enforce high-quality data before DB insertion. The resulting dataset comprises 20,392 Verilog samples, 751 MB of Verilog code data, which is the largest high-quality Verilog dataset for LLM fine-tuning to our knowledge.

2507.13375,"Layer assignment is critical for global routing of VLSI circuits. It converts 2D routing paths into 3D routing solutions by determining the proper metal layer for each routing segments to minimize congestion and via count. As different layers have different unit resistance and capacitance, layer assignment also has significant impacts to timing and power. With growing design complexity, it becomes increasingly challenging to simultaneously optimize timing, power, and congestion efficiently. Existing studies are mostly limited to a subset of objectives. In this paper, we propose a GPU-accelerated performance-driven layer assignment framework, GAP-LA, for holistic optimization the aforementioned objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve 0.3%-9.9% better worst negative slack (WNS) and 2.0%-5.4% better total negative slack (TNS) while maintaining power and congestion with competitive runtime compared with ISPD 2025 contest winners, especially on designs with up to 12 millions of nets."

2507.14397,"This paper presents a limit study of transformer-based large language model (LLM) inference, focusing on the fundamental performance bottlenecks imposed by memory bandwidth, memory capacity, and synchronization overhead in distributed inference systems. We develop a hardware-agnostic performance model that abstracts away implementation details, enabling the analysis of a wide range of current and near-future hardware technologies. Our analysis spans from current HBM3 memory technology used in AI accelerators like GPUs and TPUs to systems based on advanced HBM4 and advanced 3D-stacked DRAM technology. It also covers SRAM-based designs and scaling techniques from distributed clusters with varying numbers of chips to wafer-scale integration. Our key findings for auto-regressive decoding are: i) serving LLMs requires 100s of GB per server to serve a model instance; ii) high memory bandwidth is critical for high per-user throughput; iii) exposed synchronization latencies to achieve collective communication must be around 1us else they make the memory bandwidth ineffective; iv) DRAM-based designs have a fundamental advantage in terms of system-level efficiency as measured in throughput per cost or watt; and v) hardware designs can easily reach 2000+ user token/sec but getting to 10,000+ tokens/sec will need smaller models, smaller context, or other forms of algorithmic advances.

2507.153,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading neural rendering technique for high-fidelity view synthesis, prompting the development of dedicated 3DGS accelerators for resource-constrained platforms. The conventional decoupled preprocessing-rendering dataflow in existing accelerators has two major limitations: 1) a significant portion of preprocessed Gaussians are not used in rendering, and 2) the same Gaussian gets repeatedly loaded across different tile renderings, resulting in substantial computational and data movement overhead. To address these issues, we propose GCC, a novel accelerator designed for fast and energy-efficient 3DGS inference. GCC introduces a novel dataflow featuring: 1) \textit{cross-stage conditional processing}, which interleaves preprocessing and rendering to dynamically skip unnecessary Gaussian preprocessing; and 2) \textit{Gaussian-wise rendering}, ensuring that all rendering operations for a given Gaussian are completed before moving to the next, thereby eliminating duplicated Gaussian loading. We also propose an alpha-based boundary identification method to derive compact and accurate Gaussian regions, thereby reducing rendering costs. We implement our GCC accelerator in 28nm technology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art 3DGS inference accelerator, GSCore, in both performance and energy efficiency."
2507.15465,"Computational workloads composing traditional Transformer models are starkly bifurcated. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is memory-bound, with low arithmetic intensity, while feedforward layers are compute-bound. This dichotomy has long motivated research into specialized hardware to mitigate the MHA bottleneck.This paper argues that recent architectural shifts, namely Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), challenge the premise of specialized attention hardware. We make two key observations. First, the arithmetic intensity of MLA is over two orders of magnitude greater than that of MHA, shifting it close to a compute-bound regime well-suited for modern accelerators like GPUs. Second, by distributing MoE experts across a pool of accelerators, their arithmetic intensity can be tuned through batching to match that of the dense layers, creating a more balanced computational profile.These findings reveal a diminishing need for specialized attention hardware. The central challenge for next-generation Transformers is no longer accelerating a single memory-bound layer. Instead, the focus must shift to designing balanced systems with sufficient compute, memory capacity, memory bandwidth, and high-bandwidth interconnects to manage the diverse demands of large-scale models."
2507.15603,"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly favored for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices due to their energy-efficient and event-driven processing capabilities. However, training SNNs remains challenging because of the computational intensity of traditional backpropagation algorithms adapted for spike-based systems. In this paper, we propose a novel software-hardware co-design that introduces a hardware-friendly training algorithm, Spiking Direct Feedback Alignment (SDFA) and implement it on a Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM)-based In-Memory Computing (IMC) architecture, referred to as PipeSDFA, to accelerate SNN training. Software-wise, the computational complexity of SNN training is reduced by the SDFA through the elimination of sequential error propagation. Hardware-wise, a three-level pipelined dataflow is designed based on IMC architecture to parallelize the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that the PipeSDFA training accelerator incurs less than 2% accuracy loss on five datasets compared to baselines, while achieving 1.1X~10.5X and 1.37X~2.1X reductions in training time and energy consumption, respectively compared to PipeLayer."

However, Design for Testability (DFT) remains a relatively underexplored area. This paper presents VeriRAG, the first LLM-assisted DFT-EDA framework. VeriRAG leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enable LLM to revise code to ensure DFT compliance. VeriRAG integrates (1) an autoencoder-based similarity measurement model for precise retrieval of reference RTL designs for the LLM, and (2) an iterative code revision pipeline that allows the LLM to ensure DFT compliance while maintaining synthesizability. To support VeriRAG, we introduce VeriDFT, a Verilog-based DFT dataset curated for DFT-aware RTL repairs. VeriRAG retrieves structurally similar RTL designs from VeriDFT, each paired with a rigorously validated correction, as references for code repair. With VeriRAG and VeriDFT, we achieve fully automated DFT correction -- resulting in a 7.72-fold improvement in successful repair rate compared to the zero-shot baseline (Fig. 5 in Section V). Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of each component of the VeriRAG framework. We open-source our data, models, and scripts atthis https URL."

However, its computationally intensive nature poses significant challenges for resource-constrained autonomous driving hardware. This paper presents an end-to-end FPGA-based acceleration framework targeting the quadratic programming (QP), core of optimization-based path planning. We employ a hardware-friendly alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for QP solving and a parallelizable preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method for linear systems. By analyzing sparse matrix patterns, we propose customized storage schemes and efficient sparse matrix multiplication units, significantly reducing resource usage and accelerating matrix operations.

2507.16326,"Sorting is one of the fundamental problems in computer science. Playing a role in many processes, it has a lower complexity bound imposed by $\mathcal{O}(n\log{n})$ when executing on a sequential machine. This limit can be brought down to sub-linear times thanks to parallelization techniques that increase the number of comparisons done in parallel. This, however, increases the cost of implementation, which limits the application of such techniques. Moreover, as the size of the arrays increases, a bottleneck arises in moving the vast quantities of data required at the input, and generated at the output of such sorter. This might impose time requirements much stricter than those of the sorting itself. In this paper, a novel parallel sorter is proposed for the specific case where the input is parallel, but the output is serial. The design is then implemented and verified on an FPGA within the context of a quantum LDPC decoder. A latency of $\log{n}$ is achieved for the output of the first element, after which the rest stream out for a total sorting time of $n+\log{n}$. Contrary to other parallel sorting methods, clock speed does not degrade with $n$, and resources scale linearly with input size."
2507.16379,"Approximate computing offers promising energy efficiency benefits for error-tolerant applications, but discovering optimal approximations requires extensive design space exploration (DSE). Predicting the accuracy of circuits composed of approximate components without performing complete synthesis remains a challenging problem. Current machine learning approaches used to automate this task require retraining for each new circuit configuration, making them computationally expensive and time-consuming. This paper presents ApproxGNN, a construction methodology for a pre-trained graph neural network model predicting QoR and HW cost of approximate accelerators employing approximate adders from a library. This approach is applicable in DSE for assignment of approximate components to operations in accelerator. Our approach introduces novel component feature extraction based on learned embeddings rather than traditional error metrics, enabling improved transferability to unseen circuits. ApproxGNN models can be trained with a small number of approximate components, supports transfer to multiple prediction tasks, utilizes precomputed embeddings for efficiency, and significantly improves accuracy of the prediction of approximation error. On a set of image convolutional filters, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings improve prediction accuracy (mean square error) by 50% compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, the overall prediction accuracy is 30% better than statistical machine learning approaches without fine-tuning and 54% better with fast finetuning."
2507.16391,"With the wide application of machine learning (ML), privacy concerns arise with user data as they may contain sensitive information. Privacy-preserving ML (PPML) based on cryptographic primitives has emerged as a promising solution in which an ML model is directly computed on the encrypted data to provide a formal privacy guarantee. However, PPML frameworks heavily rely on the oblivious transfer (OT) primitive to compute nonlinear functions. OT mainly involves the computation of single-point correlated OT (SPCOT) and learning parity with noise (LPN) operations. As OT is still computed extensively on general-purpose CPUs, it becomes the latency bottleneck of modern PPML frameworks.In this paper, we propose a novel OT accelerator, dubbed Ironman, to significantly increase the efficiency of OT and the overall PPML framework. We observe that SPCOT is computation-bounded, and thus propose a hardware-friendly SPCOT algorithm with a customized accelerator to improve SPCOT computation throughput. In contrast, LPN is memory-bandwidth-bounded due to irregular memory access patterns. Hence, we further leverage the near-memory processing (NMP) architecture equipped with memory-side cache and index sorting to improve effective memory bandwidth. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate Ironman achieves a 39.2-237.4 times improvement in OT throughput across different NMP configurations compared to the full-thread CPU implementation. For different PPML frameworks, Ironman demonstrates a 2.1-3.4 times reduction in end-to-end latency for both CNN and Transformer models."

Although prior work has investigated accelerating these kernels as part of an overarching ZKP protocol, exploiting this common tree pattern remains relatively underexplored. We conduct a systematic evaluation of these tree-based workloads under different traversal strategies, analyzing performance on multi-threaded CPUs and the Multifunction Tree Unit (MTU) hardware accelerator. We introduce a hardware-friendly Hybrid Traversal for binary tree that improves parallelism and scalability while significantly reducing memory traffic on hardware. Our results show that MTU achieves up to $1478\times$ speedup over CPU at DDR-level bandwidth and that our hybrid traversal outperforms breadth-first search by up to $3\times$.

2507.1804,"Multi-chiplet architectures enabled by glass interposer offer superior electrical performance, enable higher bus widths due to reduced crosstalk, and have lower capacitance in the redistribution layer than current silicon interposer-based systems. These advantages result in lower energy per bit, higher communication frequencies, and extended interconnect range. However, deformation of the package (warpage) in glass interposer-based systems becomes a critical challenge as system size increases, leading to severe mechanical stress and reliability concerns. Beyond a certain size, conventional packaging techniques fail to manage warpage effectively, necessitating new approaches to mitigate warpage induced bending with scalable performance for glass interposer based multi-chiplet systems. To address these inter-twined challenges, we propose a thermal-, warpage-, and performance-aware design framework that employs architecture and packaging co-optimization. The proposed framework disintegrates the surface and embedded chiplets to balance conflicting design objectives, ensuring optimal trade-offs between performance, power, and structural reliability. Our experiments demonstrate that optimized multi-chiplet architectures from our design framework achieve up to 64.7% performance improvement and 40% power reduction compared to traditional 2.5D systems to execute deep neural network workloads with lower fabrication costs."

Existing CPU-based solutions ignore workload differences between the prefill and the decode phases of LLM inference, applying a static per-NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node model partition and utilizing vendor libraries for operator-level execution, which is suboptimal. We propose Sandwich, a hardware-centric CPU-based LLM serving engine that uses different execution plans for the prefill and decode phases and optimizes them separately.We evaluate Sandwich across diverse baselines and datasets on five CPU platforms, including x86 with AVX-2 and AVX-512, as well as ARM with NEON. Sandwich achieves an average 2.01x throughput improvement and 90% satisfactory time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT) latencies with up to 3.40x lower requirements in single sequence serving, and significant improvement in Goodput in continuous-batching serving.

2507.18581,"As DRAM density increases, Rowhammer becomes more severe due to heightened charge leakage, reducing the number of activations needed to induce bit flips. The DDR5 standard addresses this threat with in-DRAM per-row activation counters (PRAC) and the Alert Back-Off (ABO) signal to trigger mitigation. However, PRAC adds performance overhead by incrementing counters during the precharge phase, and recovery refreshes stalls the entire memory channel, even if only one bank is under attack.We propose PRACtical, a performance-optimized approach to PRAC+ABO that maintains the same security guarantees. First, we reduce counter update latency by introducing a centralized increment circuit, enabling overlap between counter updates and subsequent row activations in other subarrays. Second, we enhance the $RFM_{ab}$ mitigation by enabling bank-level granularity: instead of stalling the entire channel, only affected banks are paused. This is achieved through a DRAM-resident register that identifies attacked banks.PRACtical improves performance by 8% on average (up to 20%) over the state-of-the-art, reduces energy by 19%, and limits performance degradation from aggressive performance attacks to less than 6%, all while preserving Rowhammer protection."

Tree-based topologies such as the \textit{Rail-optimized} network are extremely expensive, while direct topologies such as \textit{Torus} have insufficient bisection bandwidth and flexibility. In this paper, we propose \textit{RailX}, a reconfigurable network architecture based on intra-node direct connectivity and inter-node circuit switching. Nodes and optical switches are physically 2D-organized, achieving better scalability than existing centralized circuit switching networks. We propose a novel interconnection method based on \textit{Hamiltonian Decomposition} theory to organize separate rail-based rings into \textit{all-to-all} topology, simultaneously optimizing ring-collective and all-to-all communication. More than $100$K chips with hyper bandwidth can be interconnected with a flat switching layer, and the diameter is only $2\sim4$ inter-node hops. The network cost per injection/All-Reduce bandwidth of \textit{RailX} is less than $10\%$ of the Fat-Tree, and the cost per bisection/All-to-All bandwidth is less than $50\%$ of the Fat-Tree. Specifically, only $\sim$\$$1.3$B is required to interconnect 200K chips with 1.8TB bandwidth. \textit{RailX} can also be used in the ML-as-a-service (MLaaS) scenario, where single or multiple training workloads with various shapes, scales, and parallelism strategies can be flexibly mapped, and failures can be worked around."

However, implementing dynamic 3DGS on edge devices faces challenges: (1) Loading all Gaussian parameters from DRAM for frustum culling incurs high energy costs. (2) Increased parameters for dynamic scenes elevate sorting latency and energy consumption. (3) Limited on-chip buffer capacity with higher parameters reduces buffer reuse, causing frequent DRAM access. (4) Dynamic 3DGS operations are not readily compatible with digital compute-in-memory (DCIM). These challenges hinder real-time performance and power efficiency on edge devices, leading to reduced battery life or requiring bulky batteries. To tackle these challenges, we propose algorithm-hardware co-design techniques. At the algorithmic level, we introduce three optimizations: (1) DRAM-access reduction frustum culling to lower DRAM access overhead, (2) Adaptive tile grouping to enhance on-chip buffer reuse, and (3) Adaptive interval initialization Bucket-Bitonic sort to reduce sorting latency. At the hardware level, we present a DCIM-friendly computation flow that is evaluated using the measured data from a 16nm DCIM prototype chip. Our experimental results on Large-Scale Real-World Static/Dynamic Datasets demonstrate the ability to achieve high frame rate real-time rendering exceeding 200 frame per second (FPS) with minimal power consumption, merely 0.28 W for static Large-Scale Real-World scenes and 0.63 W for dynamic Large-Scale Real-World scenes. This work successfully addresses the significant challenges of implementing static/dynamic 3DGS technology on resource-constrained edge devices."
2507.19142,"Conventional large language models (LLMs) are equipped with dozens of GB to TB of model parameters, making inference highly energy-intensive and costly as all the weights need to be loaded to onboard processing elements during computation. Recently, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as an efficient alternative, promising efficient inference with less activated weights per token. Nevertheless, fine-grained MoE-based LLMs face several challenges: 1) Variable workloads during runtime create arbitrary GEMV-GEMM ratios that reduce hardware utilization, 2) Traditional MoE-based scheduling for LLM serving cannot fuse attention operations with MoE operations, leading to increased latency and decreased hardware utilization, and 3) Despite being more efficient than conventional LLMs, loading experts from DRAM still consumes significant energy and requires substantial DRAM bandwidth. Addressing these challenges, we propose: 1) A3D-MoE, a 3D Heterogeneous Integration system that employs state-of-the-art vertical integration technology to significantly enhance memory bandwidth while reducing Network-on-Chip (NoC) overhead and energy consumption. 2) A 3D-Adaptive GEMV-GEMM-ratio systolic array with V-Cache efficient data reuse and a novel unified 3D dataflow to solve the problem of reduced hardware utilization caused by arbitrary GEMV-GEMM ratios from different workloads, 3) A Hardware resource-aware operation fusion scheduler that fuses attention operations with MoE operations to enhance hardware performance, and 4) MoE Score-Aware HBM access reduction with even-odd expert placement that reduces DRAM access and bandwidth requirements. Our evaluation results indicate that A3D-MoE delivers significant performance enhancements, reducing latency by a factor of 1.8x to 2x and energy consumption by 2x to 4x, while improving throughput by 1.44x to 1.8x compared to the state-of-the-art."
2507.1957,"This paper presents MCP4EDA, the first Model Context Protocol server that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the complete open-source RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interaction. The system integrates Yosys synthesis, Icarus Verilog simulation, OpenLane place-and-route, GTKWave analysis, and KLayout visualization into a unified LLM-accessible interface, enabling designers to execute complex multi-tool EDA workflows conversationally via AI assistants such as Claude Desktop and Cursor IDE. The principal contribution is a backend-aware synthesis optimization methodology wherein LLMs analyze actual post-layout timing, power, and area metrics from OpenLane results to iteratively refine synthesis TCL scripts, establishing a closed-loop optimization system that bridges the traditional gap between synthesis estimates and physical implementation reality. In contrast to conventional flows that rely on wire-load models, this methodology leverages real backend performance data to guide synthesis parameter tuning, optimization sequence selection, and constraint refinement, with the LLM functioning as an intelligent design space exploration agent. Experimental evaluation on representative digital designs demonstrates 15-30% improvements in timing closure and 10-20% area reduction compared to default synthesis flows, establishing MCP4EDA as the first practical LLM-controlled end-to-end open-source EDA automation system.

2507.19819,"Industry adoption of chiplets has been increasing as a cost-effective option for making larger high-performance systems. Consequently, partitioning large systems into chiplets is increasingly important. In this work, we introduce ChipletPart - a cost-driven 2.5D system partitioner that addresses the unique constraints of chiplet systems, including complex objective functions, limited reach of inter-chiplet I/O transceivers, and the assignment of heterogeneous manufacturing technologies to different chiplets. ChipletPart integrates a sophisticated chiplet cost model with its underlying genetic algorithm-based technology assignment and partitioning methodology, along with a simulated annealing-based chiplet floorplanner. Our results show that: (i) ChipletPart reduces chiplet cost by up to 58% (20% geometric mean) compared to state-of-the-art min-cut partitioners, which often yield floorplan-infeasible solutions; (ii) ChipletPart generates partitions with up to 47% (6% geometric mean) lower cost as compared to the prior work Floorplet; and (iii) for the testcases we study, heterogeneous integration reduces cost by up to 43% (15% geometric mean) compared to homogeneous implementations. Additionally, we explore Bayesian optimization (BO) for finding low cost and floorplan-feasible chiplet solutions with technology assignments. On some testcases, our BO framework achieves better system cost (up to 5.3% improvement) with higher runtime overhead (up to 4x) compared to our GA framework. We also present case studies that show how changes in packaging and inter-chiplet signaling technologies can affect partitioning solutions. Finally, we make ChipletPart, the underlying chiplet cost model, and a chiplet testcase generator available as open-source tools for the community."
2507.20007,"Edge AI deployments are becoming increasingly complex, necessitating energy-efficient solutions for resource-constrained embedded systems. Approximate computing, which allows for controlled inaccuracies in computations, is emerging as a promising approach for improving power and energy efficiency. Among the key techniques in approximate computing are approximate arithmetic operators (AxOs), which enable application-specific optimizations beyond traditional computer arithmetic hardware reduction-based methods, such as quantization and precision scaling. Existing design space exploration (DSE) frameworks for approximate computing limit themselves to selection-based approaches or custom synthesis at fixed abstraction levels, which restricts the flexibility required for finding application-specific optimal solutions. Further, the tools available for the DSE of AxOs are quite limited in terms of exploring different approximation models and extending the analysis to different granularities. To this end, we propose AxOSyn, an open-source framework for the DSE of AxOs that supports both selection and synthesis approaches at various abstraction levels. AxOSyn allows researchers to integrate custom methods for evaluating approximations and facilitates DSE at both the operator-level and application-specific. Our framework provides an effective methodology for achieving energy-efficient, approximate operators."
2507.20412,"Data-intensive applications in data centers, especially machine learning (ML), have made the network a bottleneck, which in turn has motivated the development of more efficient network protocols and infrastructure. For instance, remote direct memory access (RDMA) has become the standard protocol for data transport in the cloud as it minimizes data copies and reduces CPU-utilization via host-bypassing. Similarly, an increasing amount of network functions and infrastructure have moved to accelerators, SmartNICs, and in-network computing to bypass the CPU. In this paper we explore the implementation and deployment of RoCE BALBOA, an open-source, RoCE v2-compatible, scalable up to hundreds of queue-pairs, and 100G-capable RDMA-stack that can be used as the basis for building accelerators and smartNICs. RoCE BALBOA is customizable, opening up a design space and offering a degree of adaptability not available in commercial products. We have deployed BALBOA in a cluster using FPGAs and show that it has latency and performance characteristics comparable to commercial NICs. We demonstrate its potential by exploring two classes of use cases. One involves enhancements to the protocol for infrastructure purposes (encryption, deep packet inspection using ML). The other showcases the ability to perform line-rate compute offloads with deep pipelines by implementing commercial data preprocessing pipelines for recommender systems that process the data as it arrives from the network before transferring it directly to the GPU. These examples demonstrate how BALBOA enables the exploration and development of SmartNICs and accelerators operating on network data streams."
2507.2042,"Convolution remains the most compute-intensive operation in AI acceleration, often constituting over 80-90% of the workload. Existing approaches in spatial architectures such as coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) frequently rely on loop unrolling or GEMM-based matrix transformations, introducing significant overhead in both data movement and instruction control. This paper presents a new framework designed to systematically demystify the 7-dimensional convolution loop nest by reinterpreting it as a hardware-centric data and instruction streaming problem. Instead of treating the loop nest as a fixed computational construct, our approach exposes its structure as a set of spatial and temporal mappings governed by hardware parameters such as compute element distribution, interconnect topology, and reconfigurability. This abstraction supports lightweight, flexible deployment of convolution without reliance on heavyweight transformations or reordering schemes. We demonstrate the application of our approach on the MAVeC accelerator. We detail the implementation of convolution operations in MAVeC and extend the framework to support full model execution on VGG-16. Our profiling reveals high PE utilization (over 90%), significant fold reuse, and scalable throughput up to 1.56 TFLOPs/sec and 12.7 KIPS for end-to-end VGG-16 inference. These results validate the efficacy of our approach in minimizing control overhead, improving data locality, and enabling efficient large-scale convolution execution without reliance on conventional transformation-based methods."
2507.2143,"Parameter extraction for industry-standard device models like ASM-HEMT is crucial in circuit design workflows. However, many manufacturers do not provide such models, leaving users to build them using only datasheets. Unfortunately, datasheets lack sufficient information for standard step-by-step extraction. Moreover, manual data extraction from datasheets is highly time-consuming, and the absence of a fully automated method forces engineers to perform tedious manual work. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel, end-to-end framework that fully automates the generation of simulation-ready ASM-HEMT SPICE models directly from PDF datasheets. Our framework is founded on two core innovations: 1) a multi-modal AI pipeline that integrates computer vision with a large language model (LLM) to robustly parse heterogeneous datasheet layouts and digitize characteristic curves, and 2) a novel Iterative-Focusing Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (IF-TPE) optimization algorithm is specifically designed for device parameter extraction under the high-dimensional, sparse-data condition by adaptively refining the parameter search space. Experimental validation on a diverse set of 17 commercial HEMT devices from 10 manufacturers confirms the framework's accuracy and robustness. The generated models demonstrate excellent agreement with published DC and RF characteristics. As the first fully automated workflow of its kind, our proposed solution offers a transformative approach to device modeling, poised to significantly accelerate the circuit design cycle by eliminating the need for manual parameter extraction."
2507.21499,"Rendering is critical in fields like 3D modeling, AR/VR, and autonomous driving, where high-quality, real-time output is essential. Point-based neural rendering (PBNR) offers a photorealistic and efficient alternative to conventional methods, yet it is still challenging to achieve real-time rendering on mobile platforms. We pinpoint two major bottlenecks in PBNR pipelines: LoD search and splatting. LoD search suffers from workload imbalance and irregular memory access, making it inefficient on off-the-shelf GPUs. Meanwhile, splatting introduces severe warp divergence across GPU threads due to its inherent sparsity.To tackle these challenges, we propose SLTarch, an algorithm-architecture co-designed framework. At its core, SLTarch introduces SLTree, a dedicated subtree-based data structure, and LTcore, a specialized hardware architecture tailored for efficient LoD search. Additionally, we co-design a divergence-free splatting algorithm with our simple yet principled hardware augmentation, SPcore, to existing PBNR accelerators. Compared to a mobile GPU, SLTarch achieves 3.9$\times$ speedup and 98\% energy savings with negligible architecture overhead. Compared to existing accelerator designs, SLTarch achieves 1.8$\times$ speedup with 54\% energy savings."
2507.21572,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality rendering of 3D scenes and is getting increasing adoption in domains like autonomous driving and embodied intelligence. However, 3DGS still faces major efficiency challenges when faced with high frame rate requirements and resource-constrained edge deployment. To enable efficient 3DGS, in this paper, we propose LS-Gaussian, an algorithm/hardware co-design framework for lightweight streaming 3D rendering. LS-Gaussian is motivated by the core observation that 3DGS suffers from substantial computation redundancy and stalls. On one hand, in practical scenarios, high-frame-rate 3DGS is often applied in settings where a camera observes and renders the same scene continuously but from slightly different viewpoints. Therefore, instead of rendering each frame separately, LS-Gaussian proposes a viewpoint transformation algorithm that leverages inter-frame continuity for efficient sparse rendering. On the other hand, as different tiles within an image are rendered in parallel but have imbalanced workloads, frequent hardware stalls also slow down the rendering process. LS-Gaussian predicts the workload for each tile based on viewpoint transformation to enable more balanced parallel computation and co-designs a customized 3DGS accelerator to support the workload-aware mapping in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate that LS-Gaussian achieves 5.41x speedup over the edge GPU baseline on average and up to 17.3x speedup with the customized accelerator, while incurring only minimal visual quality degradation."
2507.21694,"As large language models demonstrate enormous potential in the field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), generative AI-assisted chip design is attracting widespread attention from academia and industry. Although these technologies have made preliminary progress in tasks such as code generation, their application in chip verification -- a critical bottleneck in the chip development cycle -- remains at an exploratory stage. This paper proposes an innovative Multi-Agent Verification Framework (MAVF) aimed at addressing the limitations of current single-LLM approaches in complex verification tasks. Our framework builds an automated transformation system from design specifications to testbench through the collaborative work of multiple specialized agents, including specification parsing, verification strategy generation, and code implementation. Through verification experiments on multiple chip modules of varying complexity, results show that MAVF significantly outperforms traditional manual methods and single-dialogue generative AI approaches in verification document parsing and generation, as well as automated testbench generation. This research opens new directions for exploring generative AI applications in verification automation, potentially providing effective approaches to solving the most challenging bottleneck issues in chip design."
2507.22221,"Sequence alignment is a fundamental process in computational biology which identifies regions of similarity in biological sequences. With the exponential growth in the volume of data in bioinformatics databases, the time, processing power, and memory bandwidth for comparing a query sequence with the available databases grows proportionally. The sequence alignment algorithms often involve simple arithmetic operations and feature high degrees of inherent fine-grained and coarse-grained parallelism. These features can be potentially exploited by a massive parallel processor, such as a GPU, to increase throughput. In this paper, we show that the excessive memory bandwidth demand of the sequence alignment algorithms prevents exploiting the maximum achievable throughput on conventional parallel machines. We then propose a memory-aware architecture to reduce the bandwidth demand of the sequence alignment algorithms, effectively pushing the memory wall to extract higher throughput. The design is integrated at the logic layer of an emerging 3D DRAM as a processing-in-memory architecture to further increase the available bandwidth. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture results in up to 2.4x speedup over a GPU-based design. Moreover, by moving the computation closer to the memory, power consumption is reduced by 37%, on average."

2508.0118,"Attention-based models demand flexible hardware to manage diverse kernels with varying arithmetic intensities and memory access patterns. Large clusters with shared L1 memory, a common architectural pattern, struggle to fully utilize their processing elements (PEs) when scaled up due to reduced throughput in the hierarchical PE-to-L1 intra-cluster interconnect. This paper presents Dynamic Allocation Scheme (DAS), a runtime programmable address remapping hardware unit coupled with a unified memory allocator, designed to minimize data access contention of PEs onto the multi-banked L1. We evaluated DAS on an aggressively scaled-up 1024-PE RISC-V cluster with Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) PE-to-L1 interconnect to demonstrate its potential for improving data locality in large parallel machine learning workloads. For a Vision Transformer (ViT)-L/16 model, each encoder layer executes in 5.67 ms, achieving a 1.94x speedup over the fixed word-level interleaved baseline with 0.81 PE utilization. Implemented in 12nm FinFET technology, DAS incurs <0.1 % area overhead."
2508.01786,"Too many defective compute chips are escaping existing manufacturing tests -- at least an order of magnitude more than industrial targets across all compute chip types in data centers. Silent data corruptions (SDCs) caused by test escapes, when left unaddressed, pose a major threat to reliable computing. We present a three-pronged approach outlining future directions for overcoming test escapes: (a) Quick diagnosis of defective chips directly from system-level incorrect behaviors. Such diagnosis is critical for gaining insights into why so many defective chips escape existing manufacturing testing. (b) In-field detection of defective chips. (c) New test experiments to understand the effectiveness of new techniques for detecting defective chips. These experiments must overcome the drawbacks and pitfalls of previous industrial test experiments and case studies."
2508.018,"Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained IoT devices remains a challenging problem, often requiring hardware modifications tailored to individual AI models. Existing accelerator-generation tools, such as AMD's FINN, do not adequately address extreme resource limitations faced by IoT endpoints operating in bare-metal environments without an operating system (OS). To overcome these constraints, we propose MARVEL-an automated, end-to-end framework that generates custom RISC-V ISA extensions tailored to specific DNN model classes, with a primary focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed method profiles high-level DNN representations in Python and generates an ISA-extended RISC-V core with associated compiler tools for efficient deployment. The flow leverages (1) Apache TVM for translating high-level Python-based DNN models into optimized C code, (2) Synopsys ASIP Designer for identifying compute-intensive kernels, modeling, and generating a custom RISC-V and (3) Xilinx Vivado for FPGA implementation. Beyond a model class specific RISC-V, our approach produces an optimized bare-metal C implementation, eliminating the need for an OS or extensive software dependencies. Unlike conventional deployment pipelines relying on TensorFlow/PyTorch runtimes, our solution enables seamless execution in highly resource-constrained environments. We evaluated the flow on popular DNN models such as LeNet-5*, MobileNetV1, ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121 using the Synopsys trv32p3 RISC-V core as a baseline. Results show a 2x speedup in inference and upto 2x reduction in energy per inference at a 28.23% area overhead when implemented on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ ZCU104 FPGA platform."
2508.02007,"Address translation is a major performance bottleneck in modern computing systems. Speculative address translation can hide this latency by predicting the physical address (PA) of requested data early in the pipeline. However, predicting the PA from the virtual address (VA) is difficult due to the unpredictability of VA-to-PA mappings in conventional OSes. Prior works try to overcome this but face two key issues: (i) reliance on large pages or VA-to-PA contiguity, which is not guaranteed, and (ii) costly hardware changes to store speculation metadata with limited effectiveness.We introduce Revelator, a hardware-OS cooperative scheme enabling highly accurate speculative address translation with minimal modifications. Revelator employs a tiered hash-based allocation strategy in the OS to create predictable VA-to-PA mappings, falling back to conventional allocation when needed. On a TLB miss, a lightweight speculation engine, guided by this policy, generates candidate PAs for both program data and last-level page table entries (PTEs). Thus, Revelator (i) speculatively fetches requested data before translation resolves, reducing access latency, and (ii) fetches the fourth-level PTE before the third-level PTE is accessed, accelerating page table walks.We prototype Revelator's OS support in Linux and evaluate it in simulation across 11 diverse, data-intensive benchmarks in native and virtualized environments. Revelator achieves average speedups of 27% (20%) in native (virtualized) settings, surpasses a state-of-the-art speculative mechanism by 5%, and reduces energy use by 9% compared to baseline. Our RTL prototype shows minimal area and power overheads on a modern CPU."
2508.02236,"Register Transfer Level (RTL) simulation is widely used in design space exploration, verification, debugging, and preliminary performance evaluation for hardware design. Among various RTL simulation approaches, software simulation is the most commonly used due to its flexibility, low cost, and ease of debugging. However, the slow simulation of complex designs has become the bottleneck in design flow. In this work, we explore the sources of computation overhead of RTL simulation and conclude them into four factors. To optimize these factors, we propose several techniques at the supernode level, node level, and bit level. Finally, we implement these techniques in a novel RTL simulator GSIM. GSIM succeeds in simulating XiangShan, the state-of-the-art open-source RISC-V processor. Besides, compared to Verilator, GSIM can achieve speedup of 7.34x for booting Linux on XiangShan, and 19.94x for running CoreMark on Rocket."
2508.02304,"Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) offer significant promise for generating photorealistic images and videos. However, existing mainstream neural rendering models often fall short in meeting the demands for immediacy and power efficiency in practical applications. Specifically, these models frequently exhibit irregular access patterns and substantial computational overhead, leading to undesirable inference latency and high power consumption. Computing-in-memory (CIM), an emerging computational paradigm, has the potential to address these access bottlenecks and reduce the power consumption associated with model execution.To bridge the gap between model performance and real-world scene requirements, we propose an algorithm-architecture co-design approach, abbreviated as ASDR, a CIM-based accelerator supporting efficient neural rendering. At the algorithmic level, we propose two rendering optimization schemes: (1) Dynamic sampling by online sensing of the rendering difficulty of different pixels, thus reducing access memory and computational overhead. (2) Reducing MLP overhead by decoupling and approximating the volume rendering of color and density. At the architecture level, we design an efficient ReRAM-based CIM architecture with efficient data mapping and reuse microarchitecture. Experiments demonstrate that our design can achieve up to $9.55\times$ and $69.75\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art NeRF accelerators and Xavier NX GPU in graphics rendering tasks with only $0.1$ PSNR loss."
2508.02536,"The energy efficiency of neural processing units (NPU) is playing a critical role in developing sustainable data centers. Our study with different generations of NPU chips reveals that 30%-72% of their energy consumption is contributed by static power dissipation, due to the lack of power management support in modern NPU chips. In this paper, we present ReGate, which enables fine-grained power-gating of each hardware component in NPU chips with hardware/software co-design. Unlike conventional power-gating techniques for generic processors, enabling power-gating in NPUs faces unique challenges due to the fundamental difference in hardware architecture and program execution model. To address these challenges, we carefully investigate the power-gating opportunities in each component of NPU chips and decide the best-fit power management scheme (i.e., hardware- vs. software-managed power gating). Specifically, for systolic arrays (SAs) that have deterministic execution patterns, ReGate enables cycle-level power gating at the granularity of processing elements (PEs) following the inherent dataflow execution in SAs. For inter-chip interconnect (ICI) and HBM controllers that have long idle intervals, ReGate employs a lightweight hardware-based idle-detection mechanism. For vector units and SRAM whose idle periods vary significantly depending on workload patterns, ReGate extends the NPU ISA and allows software like compilers to manage the power gating. With implementation on a production-level NPU simulator, we show that ReGate can reduce the energy consumption of NPU chips by up to 32.8% (15.5% on average), with negligible impact on AI workload performance. The hardware implementation of power-gating logic introduces less than 3.3% overhead in NPU chips."
2508.02977,"Transformers have proven effective in language modeling but are limited by high computational and memory demands that grow quadratically with input sequence length. State space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative by reducing attention complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$ while also lowering overall memory consumption. Vision Mamba adapts the SSM approach for computer vision tasks, achieving lower latency and memory consumption than traditional transformer models. However, deploying Vision Mamba on edge devices is challenging due to its sequential scan operations, which hinder GPU efficiency. We propose Mamba-X, an end-to-end Vision Mamba accelerator that includes a systolic scan array to maximize parallelism and minimize memory traffic, along with a hybrid, hardware-friendly quantization technique to reduce memory usage and improve hardware efficiency without sacrificing accuracy."
2508.02992,"Both SRAM and DRAM have stopped scaling: there is no technical roadmap to reduce their cost (per byte/GB). As a result, memory now dominates system cost. This paper argues for a paradigm shift from today's simple memory hierarchy toward specialized memory architectures that exploit application-specific access patterns. Rather than relying solely on traditional off-chip DRAM and on-chip SRAM, we envisage memory systems equipped with additional types of memory whose performance trade-offs benefit workloads through non-hierarchical optimization. We propose two new memory classes deserving explicit OS support: long-term RAM (LtRAM) optimized for read-intensive data with long lifetimes, and short-term RAM (StRAM) designed for transient, frequently-accessed data with short lifetimes. We explore underlying device technologies that could implement these classes, including their evolution and their potential integration into current system designs given emerging workload requirements. We identify critical research challenges to realize what we believe is a necessary evolution toward more efficient and scalable computing systems capable of meeting future demands."
2508.03837,"Designing and validating efficient cache-coherent memory subsystems is a critical yet complex task in the development of modern multi-core system-on-chip architectures. Rhea is a unified framework that streamlines the design and system-level validation of RTL cache-coherent memory subsystems. On the design side, Rhea generates synthesizable, highly configurable RTL supporting various architectural parameters. On the validation side, Rhea integrates Verilator's cycle-accurate RTL simulation with gem5's full-system simulation, allowing realistic workloads and operating systems to run alongside the actual RTL under test. We apply Rhea to design MSI-based RTL memory subsystems with one and two levels of private caches and scaling up to sixteen cores. Their evaluation with 22 applications from state-of-the-art benchmark suites shows intermediate performance relative to gem5 Ruby's MI and MOESI models. The hybrid gem5-Verilator co-simulation flow incurs a moderate simulation overhead, up to 2.7 times compared to gem5 MI, but achieves higher fidelity by simulating real RTL hardware. This overhead decreases with scale, down to 1.6 times in sixteen-core scenarios. These results demonstrate Rhea's effectiveness and scalability in enabling fast development of RTL cache-coherent memory subsystem designs."

This design enables each NAND chip to operate as a self-contained enclave without incurring area overhead, while eliminating the need for off-chip encryption. We implement FlashVault at the register-transfer level (RTL) and perform place-and-route (P&R) for accurate power/area evaluation. Our analysis shows that the power budget determines the number of cryptographic engines per NAND chip. We integrate this architectural choice into a full-system simulation and evaluate its performance on a wide range of cryptographic algorithms.

2508.039,"The fast evolution of Machine Learning (ML) models requires flexible and efficient hardware solutions as hardwired accelerators face rapid obsolescence. Vector processors are fully programmable and achieve high energy efficiencies by exploiting data parallelism, amortizing instruction fetch and decoding costs. Hence, a promising design choice is to build accelerators based on shared L1-memory clusters of streamlined Vector Processing Elements (VPEs). However, current state-of-the-art VPEs are limited in L1 memory bandwidth and achieve high efficiency only for computational kernels with high data reuse in the Vector Register File (VRF), such as General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM). Performance is suboptimal for workloads with lower data reuse like General Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV). To fully exploit available bandwidth at the L1 memory interface, the VPE micro-architecture must be optimized to achieve near-ideal utilization, i.e., to be as close as possible to the L1 memory roofline (at-the-roofline). In this work, we propose TROOP, a set of hardware optimizations that include decoupled load-store interfaces, improved vector chaining, shadow buffers to hide VRF conflicts, and address scrambling techniques to achieve at-the-roofline performance for VPEs without compromising their area and energy efficiency. We implement TROOP on an open-source streamlined vector processor in a 12nm FinFET technology. TROOP achieves significant speedups of 1.5x, 2.2x, and 2.6x, respectively, for key memory-intensive kernels such as GEMV, DOTP and AXPY, achieving at-the-roofline performance. Additionally, TROOP enhances the energy efficiency by up to 45%, reaching 38 DP-GFLOPs/W (1 GHz, TT, 0.8V) for DOTP while maintaining a high energy efficiency of 61 DP-GFLOPs/W for GEMMs, incurring only a minor area overhead of less than 7%."

Our findings reveal that most errors stem not from LLM reasoning limitations, but from insufficient RTL programming knowledge, poor understanding of circuit concepts, ambiguous design descriptions, or misinterpretation of complex multimodal inputs. Leveraging in-context learning, we propose targeted error correction techniques. Specifically, we construct a domain-specific knowledge base and employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to supply necessary RTL knowledge. To mitigate ambiguity errors, we introduce design description rules and implement a rule-checking mechanism. For multimodal misinterpretation, we integrate external tools to convert inputs into LLM-compatible meta-formats. For remaining errors, we adopt an iterative debugging loop (simulation-error localization-correction). Integrating these techniques into an LLM-based framework significantly improves performance. We incorporate these error correction techniques into a foundational LLM-based RTL code generation framework, resulting in significantly improved performance. Experimental results show that our enhanced framework achieves 91.0\% accuracy on the VerilogEval benchmark, surpassing the baseline code generation approach by 32.7\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods."

Interconnects require special care in radiation-heavy environments, as any soft error within the SoC interconnect is likely to cause a functional failure of the whole SoC. This work proposes relOBI, an extension to the Open Bus Interface (OBI) combining triple modular redundancy (TMR) for critical handshake signals with error correction codes (ECC) protection on other signals. Implementing and testing the reliable crossbar shows improved reliability to injected single faults from a vulnerability of 34.85 % to zero compared to the irredundant baseline, with an area increase of 2.6 $\times$. The area overhead is 1.8 $\times$ lower than that reported in the literature for fine-grained triplication and voting."
2508.05779,"Recent progress on concatenated codes, especially many-hypercube codes, achieves unprecedented space efficiency. Yet two critical challenges persist in practice. First, these codes lack efficient implementations of addressable logical gates. Second, the required high degree of parallelism and long-range interactions pose significant challenges for current hardware platforms. In this paper, we propose an efficient compilation approach for concatenated codes, specifically many-hypercube codes, targeted at neutral atom arrays, which provide the necessary parallelism and long-range interactions. Our approach builds on two key innovations. First, we introduce Automorphism-assisted Hierarchical Addressing (AHA) logical CNOT gates that significantly reduce spacetime overhead compared to conventional distillation-based methods. Second, we develop Virtual Atom Intermediate Representation (VAIR) that enables level-wise optimization and legalization. We implement these innovations in ConiQ, a hardware-aware quantum compiler designed to compile fault-tolerant quantum circuits for neutral atom arrays using many-hypercube codes. Our evaluation demonstrates that ConiQ achieves up to 2000x reduction in spacetime overhead and up to 10^6x reduction in compilation time compared to state-of-the-art compilers, with our AHA gates providing an additional overhead reduction of up to 20x. These results establish concatenated codes as a promising approach for fault-tolerant quantum computing in the near future."
2508.06047,"Modern SoC datapaths include deeply pipelined, domain-specific accelerators, but their RTL implementation and verification are still mostly done by hand. While large language models (LLMs) exhibit advanced code-generation abilities for programming languages like Python, their application to Verilog-like RTL remains in its nascent stage. This is reflected in the simple arithmetic and control circuits currently used to evaluate generative capabilities in existing benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce ArchXBench, a six-level benchmark suite that encompasses complex arithmetic circuits and other advanced digital subsystems drawn from domains such as cryptography, image processing, machine learning, and signal processing. Architecturally, some of these designs are purely combinational, others are multi-cycle or pipelined, and many require hierarchical composition of modules. For each benchmark, we provide a problem description, design specification, and testbench, enabling rapid research in the area of LLM-driven agentic approaches for complex digital systems design.Using zero-shot prompting with Claude Sonnet 4, GPT 4.1, o4-mini-high, and DeepSeek R1 under a pass@5 criterion, we observed that o4-mini-high successfully solves the largest number of benchmarks, 16 out of 30, spanning Levels 1, 2, and 3. From Level 4 onward, however, all models consistently fail, highlighting a clear gap in the capabilities of current state-of-the-art LLMs and prompting/agentic approaches."
2508.06344,"Fault simulation and emulation are essential techniques for evaluating the dependability of integrated circuits, enabling early-stage vulnerability analysis and supporting the implementation of effective mitigation strategies. High-level hardware description languages such as Chisel facilitate the rapid development of complex fault scenarios with minimal modification to the design. However, existing Chisel-based fault injection (FI) frameworks are limited by coarse-grained, instruction-level controllability, restricting the precision of fault modeling. This work introduces Nail, a Chisel-based open-source FI framework that overcomes these limitations by introducing state-based faults. This approach enables fault scenarios that depend on specific system states, rather than solely on instruction-level triggers, thereby removing the need for precise timing of fault activation. For greater controllability, Nail allows users to arbitrarily modify internal trigger states via software at runtime. To support this, Nail automatically generates a software interface, offering straightforward access to the instrumented design. This enables fine-tuning of fault parameters during active FI campaigns - a feature particularly beneficial for FPGA emulation, where synthesis is time-consuming. Utilizing these features, Nail narrows the gap between the high speed of emulation-based FI frameworks, the usability of software-based approaches, and the controllability achieved in simulation. We demonstrate Nail's state-based FI and software framework by modeling a faulty general-purpose register in a RISC-V processor. Although this might appear straightforward, it requires state-dependent FI and was previously impossible without fundamental changes to the design. The approach was validated in both simulation and FPGA emulation, where the addition of Nail introduced less than 1% resource overhead."
2508.06978,"Large Language Models (LLMs) applying Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scale to trillions of parameters but require vast memory, motivating a line of research to offload expert weights from fast-but-small DRAM (HBM) to denser Flash SSDs. While SSDs provide cost-effective capacity, their read energy per bit is substantially higher than that of DRAM. This paper quantitatively analyzes the energy implications of offloading MoE expert weights to SSDs during the critical decode stage of LLM inference. Our analysis, comparing SSD, CPU memory (DDR), and HBM storage scenarios for models like DeepSeek-R1, reveals that offloading MoE weights to current SSDs drastically increases per-token-generation energy consumption (e.g., by up to ~12x compared to the HBM baseline), dominating the total inference energy budget. Although techniques like prefetching effectively hide access latency, they cannot mitigate this fundamental energy penalty. We further explore future technological scaling, finding that the inherent sparsity of MoE models could potentially make SSDs energy-viable if Flash read energy improves significantly, roughly by an order of magnitude."

Five configurations are synthesized and evaluated using the IMEC A10 nanosheet node PDK. Key physical design metrics are compared across configurations and against VWR2A, a state-of-the-art (SoA) DSIP baseline. Results show that our architecture achieves over 2x lower normalized wire length and more than 3x higher density than the SoA, with low variability in the metrics across all configurations, making it a promising solution for next-generation DSIP designs. These improvements are achieved with minimal manual layout intervention, demonstrating the architecture's intrinsic physical efficiency and potential for low-cost wire-friendly implementation."
2508.07227,"LLM inference on mobile devices faces extraneous challenges due to limited memory bandwidth and computational resources. To address these issues, speculative inference and processing-in-memory (PIM) techniques have been explored at the algorithmic and hardware levels. However, speculative inference results in more compute-intensive GEMM operations, creating new design trade-offs for existing GEMV-accelerated PIM architectures. Furthermore, there exists a significant amount of redundant draft tokens in tree-based speculative inference, necessitating efficient token management schemes to minimize energy consumption. In this work, we present LP-Spec, an architecture-dataflow co-design leveraging hybrid LPDDR5 performance-enhanced PIM architecture with draft token pruning and dynamic workload scheduling to accelerate LLM speculative inference. A near-data memory controller is proposed to enable data reallocation between DRAM and PIM banks. Furthermore, a data allocation unit based on the hardware-aware draft token pruner is developed to minimize energy consumption and fully exploit parallel execution opportunities. Compared to end-to-end LLM inference on other mobile solutions such as mobile NPUs or GEMV-accelerated PIMs, our LP-Spec achieves 13.21x, 7.56x, and 99.87x improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and energy-delay-product (EDP).

However, our experiments also show the 3D-stacked architecture faces severer thermal issues compared to 2D architecture, in terms of thermal temperature, gradient and scalability. To better exploit the potential of 3D-stacked architecture, we present Tasa, a heterogeneous architecture with cross-stack thermal optimizations to balance the temperature distribution and maximize the performance under the thermal constraints. High-performance core is designed for compute-intensive operations, while high-efficiency core is used for memory-intensive operators, e.g. attention layers. Furthermore, we propose a bandwidth sharing scheduling to improve the bandwidth utilization in such heterogeneous architecture. Extensive thermal experiments show that our Tasa architecture demonstrates greater scalability compared with the homogeneous 3D-stacked architecture, i.e. up to 5.55 $\tccentigrade$, 9.37 $\tccentigrade$, and 7.91 $\tccentigrade$ peak temperature reduction for 48, 60, and 72 core configurations.

2508.07541,"Normal basis is used in many applications because of the efficiency of the implementation. However, most space complexity reduction techniques for binary field multiplier are applicable for only optimal normal basis or Gaussian normal basis of even type. There are 187 binary fields GF(2^k) for k from 2 to 1,000 that use odd-type Gaussian normal basis. This paper presents a method to reduce the space complexity of odd-type Gaussian normal basis multipliers over binary field GF(2^k). The idea is adapted from the matrix decomposition method for optimal normal basis.

2508.07796,"Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at processing heterogeneous graph data and are widely applied in critical domains. In HGNN inference, the neighbor aggregation stage is the primary performance determinant, yet it suffers from two major sources of memory inefficiency. First, the commonly adopted per-semantic execution paradigm stores intermediate aggregation results for each semantic prior to semantic fusion, causing substantial memory expansion. Second, the aggregation process incurs extensive redundant memory accesses, including repeated loading of target vertex features across semantics and repeated accesses to shared neighbors due to cross-semantic neighborhood overlap. These inefficiencies severely limit scalability and reduce HGNN inference performance.In this work, we first propose a semantics-complete execution paradigm from a vertex perspective that eliminates per-semantic intermediate storage and redundant target vertex accesses. Building on this paradigm, we design TVL-HGNN, a reconfigurable hardware accelerator optimized for efficient aggregation. In addition, we introduce a vertex grouping technique based on cross-semantic neighborhood overlap, with hardware implementation, to reduce redundant accesses to shared neighbors. Experimental results demonstrate that TVL-HGNN achieves average speedups of 7.85x and 1.41x over the NVIDIA A100 GPU and the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator HiHGNN, respectively, while reducing energy consumption by 98.79% and 32.61%."
2508.08396,"As modern AI workloads increasingly rely on heterogeneous accelerators, ensuring high-bandwidth and layout-flexible data movements between accelerator memories has become a pressing challenge. Direct Memory Access (DMA) engines promise high bandwidth utilization for data movements but are typically optimal only for contiguous memory access, thus requiring additional software loops for data layout transformations. This, in turn, leads to excessive control overhead and underutilized on-chip interconnects. To overcome this inefficiency, we present XDMA, a distributed and extensible DMA architecture that enables layout-flexible data movements with high link utilization. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a data streaming engine as XDMA Frontend, replacing software address generators with hardware ones; (2) a distributed DMA architecture that maximizes link utilization and separates configuration from data transfer; (3) flexible plugins for XDMA enabling on-the-fly data manipulation during data transfers. XDMA demonstrates up to 151.2x/8.2x higher link utilization than software-based implementations in synthetic workloads and achieves 2.3x average speedup over accelerators with SoTA DMA in real-world applications. Our design incurs <2% area overhead over SoTA DMA solutions while consuming 17% of system power. XDMA proves that co-optimizing memory access, layout transformation, and interconnect protocols is key to unlocking heterogeneous multi-accelerator SoC performance."
2508.08457,"Long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference faces increasing compute bottlenecks as attention calculations scale with context length, primarily due to the growing KV-cache transfer overhead that saturates High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). While prefetching techniques mitigate cache misses by fetching KV data in advance, their spatial and temporal benefits present new opportunities to exploit. This work proposes a packing-prefetch scheduling architecture with monolithic 3D (M3D) back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible embedded memories with ultra-large on-chip capacity to accelerate long-context LLM inference. Our optimizations demonstrate 8.06x decode speedup and 1.83x overall latency reduction on Llama3.1-8B using TPUv6e-like hardware with additional 512MB BEOL memories over the serial execution. Evaluations of multi-request workloads on TPU-like architectures show 1.7x-2.4x throughput improvement and 1.5x-2.4x HBM bandwidth reduction compared to packing-only methods on Llama3.1-8B and Llama3.1-70B models. With the co-design of packing, prefetching, and BEOL memories, our approach alleviates HBM constraints and enables efficient long-context LLM inference."
2508.08503,"Database applications are increasingly bottlenecked by memory bandwidth and latency due to the memory wall and the limited scalability of DRAM. Join queries, central to analytical workloads, require intensive memory access and are particularly vulnerable to inefficiencies in data movement. While Processing-in-Memory (PIM) offers a promising solution, existing designs typically reuse CPU-oriented join algorithms, limiting parallelism and incurring costly inter-chip communication. Additionally, data skew, a main challenge in CPU-based joins, remains unresolved in current PIM architectures.We introduce JSPIM, a PIM module that accelerates hash join and, by extension, corresponding select queries through algorithm-hardware co-design. JSPIM deploys parallel search engines within each subarray and redesigns hash tables to achieve O(1) lookups, fully exploiting PIM's fine-grained parallelism. To mitigate skew, our design integrates subarray-level parallelism with rank-level processing, eliminating redundant off-chip transfers. Evaluations show JSPIM delivers 400x to 1000x speedup on join queries versus DuckDB. When paired with DuckDB for the full SSB benchmark, JSPIM achieves an overall 2.5x throughput improvement (individual query gains of 1.1x to 28x), at just a 7% data overhead and 2.1% per-rank PIM-enabled chip area increase."
2508.08822,"Artificial Intelligence models are currently driven by a significant up-scaling of their complexity, with massive matrix multiplication workloads representing the major computational bottleneck. In-memory computing architectures are proposed to avoid the Von Neumann bottleneck. However, both digital/binary-based and analogue in-memory computing architectures suffer from various limitations, which significantly degrade the performance and energy efficiency gains. This work proposes OISMA, a novel in-memory computing architecture that utilizes the computational simplicity of a quasi-stochastic computing domain (Bent-Pyramid system), while keeping the same efficiency, scalability, and productivity of digital memories. OISMA converts normal memory read operations into in-situ stochastic multiplication operations with a negligible cost. An accumulation periphery then accumulates the output multiplication bitstreams, achieving the matrix multiplication functionality. Extensive matrix multiplication benchmarking was conducted to analyze the accuracy of the Bent-Pyramid system, using matrix dimensions ranging from 4x4 to 512x512. The accuracy results show a significant decrease in the average relative Frobenius error, from 9.42% (for 4x4) to 1.81% (for 512x512), compared to 64-bit double precision floating-point format. A 1T1R OISMA array of 4 KB capacity was implemented using a commercial 180nm technology node and in-house RRAM technology. At 50 MHz, OISMA achieves 0.891 TOPS/W and 3.98 GOPS/mm2 for energy and area efficiency, respectively, occupying an effective computing area of 0.804241 mm2. Scaling OISMA from 180nm to 22nm technology shows a significant improvement of two orders of magnitude in energy efficiency and one order of magnitude in area efficiency, compared to dense matrix multiplication in-memory computing architectures."

Existing research typically focuses on compiler or architecture optimizations aimed at improving CGRA performance, energy efficiency, flexibility, and area utilization, under the idealistic assumption that kernels can access all data from Scratchpad Memory (SPM). However, certain complex workloads-particularly in fields like graph analytics, irregular database operations, and specialized forms of high-performance computing (e.g., unstructured mesh simulations)-exhibit irregular memory access patterns that hinder CGRA utilization, sometimes dropping below 1.5%, making the CGRA memory-bound. To address this challenge, we conduct a thorough analysis of the underlying causes of performance degradation, then propose a redesigned memory subsystem and refine the memory model. With both microarchitectural and theoretical optimization, our solution can effectively manage irregular memory accesses through CGRA-specific runahead execution mechanism and cache reconfiguration techniques. Our results demonstrate that we can achieve performance comparable to the original SPM-only system while requiring only 1.27% of the storage size. The runahead execution mechanism achieves an average 3.04x speedup (up to 6.91x), with cache reconfiguration technique providing an additional 6.02% improvement, significantly enhancing CGRA performance for irregular memory access patterns."
2508.10303,"Design space exploration (DSE) is critical for developing optimized hardware architectures, especially for AI workloads such as deep neural networks (DNNs) and large language models (LLMs), which require specialized acceleration. As model complexity grows, accelerator design spaces have expanded to O(10^17), becoming highly irregular, non-convex, and exhibiting many-to-one mappings from design configurations to performance metrics. This complexity renders direct inverse derivation infeasible and necessitates heuristic or sampling-based optimization. Conventional methods - including Bayesian optimization, gradient descent, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms - depend on iterative sampling, resulting in long runtimes and sensitivity to initialization. Deep learning-based approaches have reframed DSE as classification using recommendation models, but remain limited to small-scale (O(10^3)), less complex design spaces. To overcome these constraints, we propose a generative approach that models hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on target performance, enabling efficient learning of non-differentiable, non-bijective hardware-performance mappings. Our framework achieves 0.86% lower generation error than Bayesian optimization with a 17000x speedup, and outperforms GANDSE with 30% lower error at only 1.83x slower search. We further extend the method to a structured DSE setting, attaining 9.8% lower energy-delay product (EDP) and 6% higher performance, with up to 145.6x and 1312x faster search compared to existing optimization methods on O(10^17) design spaces.

To overcome the scarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on the domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible textbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into a textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog circuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw, unlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes, where a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in unstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning processes, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To address the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models, we explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and experimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training paradigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained supervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by constraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output distributions before and after training.

However, traditional analytical architecture-level power models are inaccurate. The recently proposed machine learning (ML)-based architecture-level power model requires sufficient data from known configurations for training, making it unrealistic.In this work, we propose AutoPower targeting fully automated architecture-level power modeling with limited known design configurations. We have two key observations: (1) The clock and SRAM dominate the power consumption of the processor, and (2) The clock and SRAM power correlate with structural information available at the architecture level. Based on these two observations, we propose the power group decoupling in AutoPower. First, AutoPower decouples across power groups to build individual power models for each group. Second, AutoPower designs power models by further decoupling the model into multiple sub-models within each power group. In our experiments, AutoPower can achieve a low mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4.36\% and a high $R^2$ of 0.96 even with only two known configurations for training. This is 5\% lower in MAPE and 0.09 higher in $R^2$ compared with McPAT-Calib, the representative ML-based power model."

While logical, electrical, and timing masking effects influence soft error probability (SEP), the combined impact of process variation (PV) and aging-induced degradation further complicates SEP estimation. Existing approaches often address PV or aging in isolation, or rely on computationally intensive methods like Monte Carlo simulations, limiting their practicality for large-scale circuit optimization. This paper introduces a novel framework for SEP analysis that holistically integrates PV and aging effects. We propose an enhanced electrical masking model and a statistical methodology to quantify soft error probability under process and aging variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy while reducing computational overhead by approximately 2.5% compared to Monte Carlo-based methods.

Recently, they have been deployed in datacenters (potentially for business-critical or industrial applications) and safety-critical systems such as self-driving cars. So, their correct functionality in the presence of potential bit-flip errors on DNN parameters stored in memories plays the key role in their applicability in safety-critical applications. In this paper, a fault tolerance approach based on Error Correcting Codes (ECC), called SPW, is proposed to ensure the correct functionality of DNNs in the presence of bit-flip faults. In the proposed approach, error occurrence is detected by the stored ECC and then, it is correct in case of a single-bit error or the weight is completely set to zero (i.e. masked) otherwise. A statistical fault injection campaign is proposed and utilized to investigate the efficacy of the proposed approach. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the DNN increases by more than 300% in the presence with Bit Error Rate of 10^(-1) in comparison to the case where ECC technique is applied, in expense of just 47.5% area overhead."

To the best of our knowledge, ATLAS is the first work that supports both time-based power simulation and general cross-design power modeling. It achieves such general time-based power modeling by proposing a new pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm customized for circuit power. Targeting golden per-cycle layout power from commercial tools, our ATLAS achieves the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of only 0.58%, 0.45%, and 5.12% for the clock tree, register, and combinational power groups, respectively, without any layout information. Overall, the MAPE for the total power of the entire design is <1%, and the inference speed of a workload is significantly faster than the standard flow of commercial tools."

Despite this potential, existing event processing solutions remain limited, often lacking complete end-to-end implementations, exhibiting high latency, and insufficiently exploiting event data sparsity. In this paper, we present HOMI, an ultra-low latency, end-to-end edge AI platform comprising a Prophesee IMX636 event sensor chip with an Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+MPSoC FPGA chip, deploying an in-house developed AI accelerator. We have developed hardware-optimized pre-processing pipelines supporting both constant-time and constant-event modes for histogram accumulation, linear and exponential time surfaces.

2508.13157,"Large Language Model (LLM) exhibits great potential in designing of analog integrated circuits (IC) because of its excellence in abstraction and generalization for knowledge. However, further development of LLM-based analog ICs heavily relies on textual description of analog ICs, while existing analog ICs are mostly illustrated in image-based circuit diagrams rather than text-based netlists. Converting circuit diagrams to netlists help LLMs to enrich the knowledge of analog IC. Nevertheless, previously proposed conversion frameworks face challenges in further application because of limited support of image styles and circuit elements. Up to now, it still remains a challenging task to effectively convert complex circuit diagrams into netlists. To this end, this paper constructs and opensources a new dataset with rich styles of circuit diagrams as well as balanced distribution of simple and complex analog ICs. And a hybrid framework, named Image2Net, is proposed for practical conversion from circuit diagrams to netlists. The netlist edit distance (NED) is also introduced to precisely assess the difference between the converted netlists and ground truth. Based on our benchmark, Image2Net achieves 80.77\% successful rate, which is 34.62\%-45.19\% higher than previous works.

Although further power and performance improvement is achievable through fine grain 3D integration, the necessary modeling and tool infrastructure has been mostly missing. We develop a cube packing engine which can simultaneously optimize physical and architectural design for effective utilization of 3D in terms of performance, area and temperature. Our experimental results using a design driver show 36% performance improvement (in BIPS) over 2D and 14% over 3D with single layer blocks. Additionally multi-layer blocks can provide up to 30% reduction in power dissipation compared to the single-layer alternatives.

Traditionally TSVs have been considered to improve the thermal conductivity in the vertical direction. However, the lateral thermal blockage effect becomes increasingly important for TSV via farms (a cluster of TSV vias used for signal bus connections between layers) because the TSV size and pitch continue to scale in {\mu}m range and the metal to insulator ratio becomes smaller. Consequently, dense TSV farms can create lateral thermal blockages in thinned silicon substrate and exacerbate the local hotspots. In this paper, we propose a thermal-aware via farm placement technique for 3-D ICs to minimize lateral heat blockages caused by dense signal bus TSV structures."

In addition, the assignment of pins on module boundaries significantly impacts the performance of subsequent stages, including detailed placement and routing. However, traditional floorplanners often overlook pin assignment with modern constraints during the floorplanning stage. In this work, we introduce Piano, a floorplanning framework that simultaneously optimizes module placement and pin assignment under multiple constraints. Specifically, we construct a graph based on the geometric relationships among modules and their netlist connections, then iteratively search for shortest paths to determine pin assignments. This graph-based method also enables accurate evaluation of feedthrough and unplaced pins, thereby guiding overall layout quality. To further improve the design, we adopt a whitespace removal strategy and employ three local optimizers to enhance layout metrics under multi-constraint scenarios. Experimental results on widely used benchmark circuits demonstrate that Piano achieves an average 6.81% reduction in HPWL, a 13.39% decrease in feedthrough wirelength, a 16.36% reduction in the number of feedthrough modules, and a 21.21% drop in unplaced pins, while maintaining zero whitespace."

With advances in interconnects such as NVLink and LPDDR5X, modern AI hardware now integrates high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with high-speed off-package DRAM, making heterogeneous memory systems a practical solution. This work investigates dynamic KV cache placement across such systems to maximize aggregated bandwidth utilization under capacity constraints.

Addressing timing violations at this early stage is essential, as modern systems demand higher speeds, where even minor timing violations can lead to functional failures or system crashes. However, traditional timing optimization heavily relies on manual expertise, requiring engineers to iteratively analyze timing reports and debug. To automate this process, this paper proposes ViTAD, a method that efficiently analyzes the root causes of timing violations and dynamically generates targeted repair strategies. Specifically, we first parse Verilog code and timing reports to construct a Signal Timing Dependency Graph (STDG). Based on the STDG, we perform violation path analysis and use large language models (LLMs) to infer the root causes of violations. Finally, by analyzing the causes of violations, we selectively retrieve relevant debugging knowledge from a domain-specific knowledge base to generate customized repair solutions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we construct a timing violation dataset based on real-world open-source projects. This dataset contains 54 cases of violations. Experimental results show that our method achieves a 73.68% success rate in repairing timing violations, while the baseline using only LLM is 54.38%. Our method improves the success rate by 19.30%."

To overcome these obstacles, innovative approaches are required. Agile chip design has already benefited from machine learning integration at various stages, including logic synthesis, placement, and routing. With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently demonstrating impressive proficiency in Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, it is promising to extend their abilities to 2.5D integration, an advanced technique that saves area overhead and development costs. However, LLM-driven chiplet design faces challenges such as flatten design, high validation cost and imprecise parameter optimization, which limit its chiplet design capability. To address this, we propose MAHL, a hierarchical LLM-based chiplet design generation framework that features six agents which collaboratively enable AI algorithm-hardware mapping, including hierarchical description generation, retrieval-augmented code generation, diverseflow-based validation, and multi-granularity design space exploration. These components together enhance the efficient generation of chiplet design with optimized Power, Performance and Area (PPA). Experiments show that MAHL not only significantly improves the generation accuracy of simple RTL design, but also increases the generation accuracy of real-world chiplet design, evaluated by Pass@5, from 0 to 0.72 compared to conventional LLMs under the best-case scenario.

Previous works on lossless synthesis utilize independent optimization to generate multiple snapshots, and use simulation and SAT solvers to identify functionally equivalent nodes. These nodes are then merged into a subject graph with choice nodes. However, such methods often neglect the quality of these choices, raising the question of whether they truly contribute to effective technology mapping.This paper introduces Cristal, a novel methodology and framework for constructing Boolean choice networks. Specifically, Cristal introduces a new flow of choice network-based synthesis and mapping, including representative logic cone search, structural mutation for generating diverse choice structures via equality saturation, and priority-ranking choice selection along with choice network construction and validation.

2508.14318,"Large Artificial Intelligence (AI) training workloads spanning several tens of thousands of GPUs present unique power management challenges. These arise due to the high variability in power consumption during the training. Given the synchronous nature of these jobs, during every iteration there is a computation-heavy phase, where each GPU works on the local data, and a communication-heavy phase where all the GPUs synchronize on the data. Because compute-heavy phases require much more power than communication phases, large power swings occur. The amplitude of these power swings is ever increasing with the increase in the size of training jobs. An even bigger challenge arises from the frequency spectrum of these power swings which, if harmonized with critical frequencies of utilities, can cause physical damage to the power grid infrastructure. Therefore, to continue scaling AI training workloads safely, we need to stabilize the power of such workloads. This paper introduces the challenge with production data and explores innovative solutions across the stack: software, GPU hardware, and datacenter infrastructure. We present the pros and cons of each of these approaches and finally present a multi-pronged approach to solving the challenge.

2508.14414,"Debugging hardware designs requires significant manual effort during hardware development. After engineers identify a bug-triggering test case in simulation-based hardware verification, they usually spend considerable time analyzing the execution trace to localize the bug. Although numerous automated hardware debugging techniques exist, they are not applicable to large designs and deep bugs. A primary reason for their limitations is that these techniques only utilize the information of a single bug-triggering test case for bug localization, which prevents them from effectively analyzing intricate hardware systems and figure out the root cause of bugs. To solve this problem, in this paper, we transform the hardware bug localization problem into a test generation problem, aiming to find a set of effective witness test cases beyond the initial bug-triggering test case to enhance hardware bug localization. Witness test cases refer to the cases that do not trigger the bug in the faulty design. By analyzing the execution differences between passing and failing test cases with spectrum-based method, we can eliminate innocent design statements and localize the buggy ones. To further refine the suspicious area, we define the criteria for effective witness test cases and use a mutation-based strategy to generate such test cases. Based on this approach, we propose an automated hardware bug localization framework named Wit-HW. We evaluate Wit-HW on 41 bugs from various hardware designs. The experimental results show that Wit-HW effectively localize 49%, 73%, 88% bugs within Top-1, Top-5, Top-10 ranks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art bug localization techniques.

This tightly coupled architecture and bare-metal flow leads to improvements in execution speed and storage efficiency, making it suitable for edge computing solutions. We evaluate the architecture on AMD's ZCU102 FPGA board using NVDLA-small configuration and test the flow using LeNet-5, ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 models.

2508.16151,"The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established language as a core general-purpose cognitive substrate, driving the demand for specialized Language Processing Units (LPUs) tailored for LLM inference. To overcome the growing energy consumption of LLM inference systems, this paper proposes a Hardwired-Neurons Language Processing Unit (HNLPU), which physically hardwires LLM weight parameters into the computational fabric, achieving several orders of magnitude computational efficiency improvement by extreme specialization. However, a significant challenge still lies in the scale of modern LLMs. An ideal estimation on hardwiring gpt-oss 120 B requires fabricating at least 6 billion dollars of photomask sets, rendering the straightforward solution economically impractical. Addressing this challenge, we propose the novel Metal-Embedding methodology. Instead of embedding weights in a 2D grid of silicon device cells, Metal-Embedding embeds weight parameters into the 3D topology of metal wires. This brings two benefits: (1) a 15x increase in density, and (2) 60 out of 70 layers of photomasks are made homogeneous across chips, including all EUV photomasks. In total, Metal-Embedding reduced the photomask cost by 112x, bringing the Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) cost of HNLPU into an economically viable range. Experimental results show that HNLPU achieved 249,960 tokens/s (5,555x/85x of GPU/WSE), 36 tokens/J (1,047x/283x of GPU/WSE), 13,232 mm2 total die area (29% inscribed rectangular area in a 300 mm wafer), \$184M estimated NRE at 5 nm technology. Analysis shows that HNLPU achieved 8.57x cost-effectiveness and 230x carbon footprint reduction compared to H100 clusters, under an annual weight updating assumption."
2508.16376,"With the rapid development of safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence, the functional safety of the corresponding electronic chips becomes more critical. Ensuring chip functional safety requires performing a large number of time-consuming RTL fault simulations during the design phase, significantly increasing the verification cycle. To meet time-to-market demands while ensuring thorough chip verification, parallel acceleration of RTL fault simulation is necessary. Due to the dynamic nature of fault propagation paths and varying fault propagation capabilities, task loads in RTL fault simulation are highly imbalanced, making traditional singledimension parallel methods, such as structural-level parallelism, ineffective. Through an analysis of fault propagation paths and task loads, we identify two types of tasks in RTL fault simulation: tasks that are few in number but high in load, and tasks that are numerous but low in load. Based on this insight, we propose a two-dimensional parallel approach that combines structurallevel and fault-level parallelism to minimize bubbles in RTL fault simulation. Structural-level parallelism combining with workstealing mechanism is used to handle the numerous low-load tasks, while fault-level parallelism is applied to split the high-load tasks. Besides, we deviate from the traditional serial execution model of computation and global synchronization in RTL simulation by proposing a unified computation/global synchronization scheduling approach, which further eliminates bubbles. Finally, we implemented a parallel RTL fault simulation framework, RIROS. Experimental results show a performance improvement of 7.0 times and 11.0 times compared to the state-of-the-art RTL fault simulation and a commercial tool."

ZKPs enable one party to convince another of a statement's validity without revealing anything else. This capability has profound implications in many domains, including: machine learning, blockchain, image authentication, and electronic voting. Despite their potential, ZKPs have seen limited deployment because of their exceptionally high computational overhead, which manifests primarily during proof generation. To mitigate these overheads, a (growing) body of researchers has proposed hardware accelerators and GPU implementations for kernels and complete protocols. Prior art spans a wide variety of ZKP schemes that vary significantly in computational overhead, proof size, verifier cost, protocol setup, and trust. The latest, and widely used ZKP protocols are intentionally designed to balance these trade-offs. A particular challenge in modern ZKP systems is supporting complex, high-degree gates using the SumCheck protocol. We address this challenge with a novel programmable accelerator that efficiently handles arbitrary custom gates via SumCheck. Our accelerator achieves upwards of $1000\times$ geomean speedup over CPU-based SumChecks across a range of gate types. We integrate this unit into a full-system accelerator, zkPHIRE, which achieves $1486\times$ geomean speedup over CPU and $11.87\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art at iso-area. zkPHIRE is the first accelerator to scale to problem sizes of $2^{30}$ nominal constraints while maintaining small proof sizes and programmability."

2508.17069,"Learned activation functions in models like Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) outperform fixed-activation architectures in terms of accuracy and interpretability; however, their computational complexity poses critical challenges for energy-constrained edge AI deployments. Conventional CPUs/GPUs incur prohibitive latency and power costs when evaluating higher order activations, limiting deployability under ultra-tight energy budgets. We address this via a reconfigurable lookup architecture with edge FPGAs. By coupling fine-grained quantization with adaptive lookup tables, our design minimizes energy-intensive arithmetic operations while preserving activation fidelity. FPGA reconfigurability enables dynamic hardware specialization for learned functions, a key advantage for edge systems that require post-deployment adaptability. Evaluations using KANs - where unique activation functions play a critical role - demonstrate that our FPGA-based design achieves superior computational speed and over $10^4$ times higher energy efficiency compared to edge CPUs and GPUs, while maintaining matching accuracy and minimal footprint overhead.

2508.1782,"The development of sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks imposes unprecedented latency and reliability demands on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, a key enabler of high-speed radio access. Recently, deep unfolding-based detectors, which map iterative algorithms onto neural network architectures, have emerged as a promising approach, combining the strengths of model-driven and data-driven methods to achieve high detection accuracy with relatively low complexity. However, algorithmic innovation alone is insufficient; software-hardware co-design is essential to meet the extreme latency requirements of 6G (i.e., 0.1 milliseconds). This motivates us to propose leveraging in-memory computing, which is an analog computing technology that integrates memory and computation within memristor circuits, to perform the intensive matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) operations inherent in deep MIMO detection at the nanosecond scale. Specifically, we introduce a novel architecture, called the deep in-memory MIMO (IM-MIMO) detector, characterized by two key features. First, each of its cascaded computational blocks is decomposed into channel-dependent and channel-independent neural network modules. Such a design minimizes the latency of memristor reprogramming in response to channel variations, which significantly exceeds computation time. Second, we develop a customized detector-training method that exploits prior knowledge of memristor-value statistics to enhance robustness against programming noise. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the IM-MIMO detector's performance, evaluating detection accuracy, processing latency, and hardware complexity. Our study quantifies detection error as a function of various factors, including channel noise, memristor programming noise, and neural network size."

This report examines its three major CPU models: the AtomicSimpleCPU (AS CPU), the TimingSimpleCPU (TS CPU), the Out-of-order (O3) CPU, and their interactions with the memory subsystem. We provide a detailed anatomical overview of each CPU's function call-chains and present how gem5 partitions its execution time for each simulated hardware layer.We perform our analysis using a lightweight profiler built on Linux's perf_event interface, with user-configurable options to target specific functions and examine their interactions in detail. By profiling each CPU across a wide selection of benchmarks, we identify their software bottlenecks. Our results show that the Ruby memory subsystem consistently accounts for the largest share of execution time in the sequential AS and TS CPUs, primarily during the instruction fetch stage. In contrast, the O3 CPU spends a relatively smaller fraction of time in Ruby, with most of its time devoted to constructing instruction instances and the various pipeline stages of the CPU.We believe that the anatomical view of each CPU's execution flow is valuable for educational purposes, as it clearly illustrates the interactions among simulated components. These insights form a foundation for optimizing gem5's performance, particularly for the AS, TS, and O3 CPUs. Moreover, our framework can be readily applied to analyze other gem5 components or to develop and evaluate new models."

To address these challenges, we present TaiBai, an event-driven, programmable many-core brain-inspired processor that leverages temporal and spatial spike sparsity to minimize bandwidth and computational overhead. TaiBai chip contains three key features: First, a brain-inspired hierarchical topology encoding scheme is designed to flexibly support arbitrary network architectures while slashing storage overhead for large-scale networks; Second, a multi-granularity instruction set enables programmability of brain-like spiking neuron or synapses with various dynamics and on-chip learning rules; Third, a co-designed compiler stack optimizes task mapping and resource allocation.

Recent breakthroughs combine SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to achieve exceptional reconstruction fidelity. However, existing 3DGS-SLAM systems provide insufficient throughput due to the need for multiple training iterations per frame and the vast number of Gaussians.In this paper, we propose AGS, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework to boost the efficiency of 3DGS-SLAM based on the intuition that SLAM systems process frames in a streaming manner, where adjacent frames exhibit high similarity that can be utilized for acceleration. On the software level: 1) We propose a coarse-then-fine-grained pose tracking method with respect to the robot's movement. 2) We avoid redundant computations of Gaussians by sharing their contribution information across frames. On the hardware level, we propose a frame covisibility detection engine to extract intermediate data from the video CODEC.

However, emerging DNN models such as large language models, state space models increasingly rely on compound operations-structured compositions of multiple basic operations-which introduce new challenges for dataflow optimization and minimizing off-chip memory traffic. Moreover, as model size continues to grow, deployment across spatially distributed compute clusters becomes essential, requiring frequent and complex collective communication. Existing dataflow optimization frameworks and performance models either focus on single operations or lack explicit modeling of collective communication cost, limiting their applicability to modern workloads.To address these limitations, we propose, a framework for modeling and optimizing dataflow for compound operations on machine learning accelerators. COMET introduces a novel representation that explicitly models collective communication across spatial clusters, along with latency and energy cost models that account for both GEMM and non-GEMM operation level dependencies within compound operations. We demonstrate COMET's capabilities to analyze and optimize dataflows for compound operations such as GEMM--Softmax, GEMM--LayerNorm, and self-attention, across both edge and cloud accelerator configurations. Our collective-aware modeling enables exploration of a broader mapping space, leading to improved performance and energy efficiency.

2509.00633,"3D-stacked High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) architectures provide high-performance memory interactions to address the well-known performance challenge, namely the memory wall. However, these architectures are susceptible to thermal vulnerabilities due to the inherent vertical adjacency that occurs during the manufacturing process of HBM architectures. We anticipate that adversaries may exploit the intense vertical and lateral adjacency to design and develop thermal performance degradation attacks on the memory banks that host data/instructions from victim applications. In such attacks, the adversary manages to inject short and intense heat pulses from vertically and/or laterally adjacent memory banks, creating a convergent thermal wave that maximizes impact and delays the victim application from accessing its data/instructions. As the attacking application does not access any out-of-range memory locations, it can bypass both design-time security tests and the operating system's memory management policies. In other words, since the attack mimics legitimate workloads, it will be challenging to detect."

2509.00911,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a promising alternative to neural radiance fields (NeRF) as it offers high speed as well as high image quality in novel view synthesis. Despite these advancements, 3D-GS still struggles to meet the frames per second (FPS) demands of real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based accelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting operations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical trade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively reduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary rasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG groups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across tiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During rasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small tiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG enables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping tiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with the original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage. GS-TG is a lossless method requiring no retraining or fine-tuning and it can be seamlessly integrated with previous 3D-GS optimization techniques. Experimental results show that GS-TG achieves an average speed-up of 1.54 times over state-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators."

2509.03103,"Capsule Network (CapsNet) has shown significant improvement in understanding the variation in images along with better generalization ability compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CapsNet preserves spatial relationship among extracted features and apply dynamic routing to efficiently learn the internal connections between capsules. However, due to the capsule structure and the complexity of the routing mechanism, it is non-trivial to accelerate CapsNet performance in its original form on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Most of the existing works on CapsNet have achieved limited acceleration as they implement only the dynamic routing algorithm on FPGA, while considering all the processing steps synergistically is important for real-world applications of Capsule Networks. Towards this, we propose a novel two-step approach that deploys a full-fledged CapsNet on FPGA. First, we prune the network using a novel Look-Ahead Kernel Pruning (LAKP) methodology that uses the sum of look-ahead scores of the model parameters. Next, we simplify the nonlinear operations, reorder loops, and parallelize operations of the routing algorithm to reduce CapsNet hardware complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work accelerating a full-fledged CapsNet on FPGA. Experimental results on the MNIST and F-MNIST datasets (typical in Capsule Network community) show that the proposed LAKP approach achieves an effective compression rate of 99.26% and 98.84%, and achieves a throughput of 82 FPS and 48 FPS on Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA, respectively. Furthermore, reducing the hardware complexity of the routing algorithm increases the throughput to 1351 FPS and 934 FPS respectively. As corroborated by our results, this work enables highly performance-efficient deployment of CapsNets on low-cost FPGA that are popular in modern edge devices."
2509.03201,"In recent years, there has been a growing trend in accelerating computationally complex non-real-time beamforming algorithms in ultrasound imaging using deep learning models. However, due to the large size and complexity these state-of-the-art deep learning techniques poses significant challenges when deploying on resource-constrained edge devices. In this work, we propose a novel capsule network based beamformer called CapsBeam, designed to operate on raw radio-frequency data and provide an envelope of beamformed data through non-steered plane wave insonification. Experiments on in-vivo data, CapsBeam reduced artifacts compared to the standard Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamforming. For in-vitro data, CapsBeam demonstrated a 32.31% increase in contrast, along with gains of 16.54% and 6.7% in axial and lateral resolution compared to the DAS. Similarly, in-silico data showed a 26% enhancement in contrast, along with improvements of 13.6% and 21.5% in axial and lateral resolution, respectively, compared to the DAS. To reduce the parameter redundancy and enhance the computational efficiency, we pruned the model using our multi-layer LookAhead Kernel Pruning (LAKP-ML) methodology, achieving a compression ratio of 85% without affecting the image quality. Additionally, the hardware complexity of the proposed model is reduced by applying quantization, simplification of non-linear operations, and parallelizing operations. Finally, we proposed a specialized accelerator architecture for the pruned and optimized CapsBeam model, implemented on a Xilinx ZU7EV FPGA. The proposed accelerator achieved a throughput of 30 GOPS for the convolution operation and 17.4 GOPS for the dynamic routing operation."

We introduce CXL-NDP, a transparent near-data processing architecture that amplifies effective CXL bandwidth without requiring changes to thethis http URLinterface or AI models. CXL-NDP integrates a precision-scalable bit-plane layout for dynamic quantization with transparent lossless compression of weights and KV caches directly within the CXL device. In end-to-end serving, CXL-NDP improves throughput by 43%, extends the maximum context length by 87%, and reduces the KV cache footprint by 46.9% without accuracy loss. Hardware synthesis confirms its practicality with a modest silicon footprint, lowering the barrier for adopting efficient, scalable CXL-based memory in generative AI infrastructure."
2509.03846,"We introduce a mapping framework for deep learning inference that takes advantage of predictable neural network behavior to plan both computation and communication ahead of time. The framework generates a unified stream of instructions and data, enabling the hardware to execute operations and route information on its own, without frequent involvement from the host and with minimal off-chip memory use. This naturally reduces reliance on I/O, off-chip memory, and host control. By leveraging fine-grained message passing on a programmable, message-based compute architecture, the framework keeps data movement local and coordinates computation across the array using techniques such as stationary-weight reuse, in-array multicasting, and staged reductions. Applied to VGG-19, the framework sustains high utilization (88 to 92 percent), with over 97 percent of messages generated internally and nearly 89 percent of time consumed on-chip transfers. Computation throughput scales beyond 1 TFLOP/s on larger arrays, while traffic reductions from reuse and local aggregation reach up to 100 MB per layer. Overall, the results highlight the effectiveness of streaming-based computation and show how our mapper enables this execution style by tightly coordinating data and instruction flow across the hardware."
2509.04153,"This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advances in deploying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object detection, classification, and tracking on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). With the increasing demand for real-time computer vision applications in domains such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and surveillance, FPGAs have emerged as a powerful alternative to GPUs and ASICs due to their reconfigurability, low power consumption, and deterministic latency. We critically examine state-of-the-art FPGA implementations of CNN-based vision tasks, covering algorithmic innovations, hardware acceleration techniques, and the integration of optimization strategies like pruning, quantization, and sparsity-aware methods to maximize performance within hardware constraints.

2509.04162,"Transformers and vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as dominant architectures in computer vision and multimodal AI, offering state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as image classification, object detection, visual question answering, and caption generation. However, their high computational complexity, large memory footprints, and irregular data access patterns present significant challenges for deployment in latency- and power-constrained environments. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) provide an attractive hardware platform for such workloads due to their reconfigurability, fine-grained parallelism, and potential for energy-efficient acceleration. This paper presents a comprehensive review of design trade-offs, optimization strategies, and implementation challenges for FPGA-based inference of transformers and VLMs. We examine critical factors such as device-class selection, memory subsystem constraints, dataflow orchestration, quantization strategies, sparsity exploitation, and toolchain choices, alongside modality-specific issues unique to VLMs, including heterogeneous compute balancing and cross-attention memory management. Additionally, we discuss emerging trends in hardware-algorithm co-design, highlighting innovations in attention mechanisms, compression, and modular overlays to improve efficiency and adaptability. Practical issues such as runtime flexibility, verification overhead, and the absence of standardized FPGA multimodal benchmarks are also considered.

2509.04173,"The efficiency of object detectors depends on factors like detection accuracy, processing time, and computational resources. Processing time is crucial for real-time applications, particularly for autonomous vehicles (AVs), where instantaneous responses are vital for safety. This review paper provides a concise yet comprehensive survey of real-time object detection (OD) algorithms for autonomous cars delving into their hardware accelerators (HAs). Non-neural network-based algorithms, which use statistical image processing, have been entirely substituted by AI algorithms, such as different models of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Their intrinsically parallel features led them to be deployable into edge-based HAs of various types, where GPUs and, to a lesser extent, ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) remain the most widely used. Throughputs of hundreds of frames/s (fps) could be reached; however, handling object detection for all the cameras available in a typical AV requires further hardware and algorithmic improvements. The intensive competition between AV providers has limited the disclosure of algorithms, firmware, and even hardware platform details. This remains a hurdle for researchers, as commercial systems provide valuable insights while academics undergo lengthy training and testing on restricted datasets and road scenarios. Consequently, many AV research papers may not be reflected in end products, being developed under limited conditions. This paper surveys state-of-the-art OD algorithms and aims to bridge the gap with technologies in commercial AVs. To our knowledge, this aspect has not been addressed in earlier surveys. Hence, the paper serves as a tangible reference for researchers designing future generations of vehicles, expected to be fully autonomous for comfort and safety."
2509.05451,"Compute-in-SRAM architectures offer a promising approach to achieving higher performance and energy efficiency across a range of data-intensive applications. However, prior evaluations have largely relied on simulators or small prototypes, limiting the understanding of their real-world potential. In this work, we present a comprehensive performance and energy characterization of a commercial compute-in-SRAM device, the GSI APU, under realistic workloads. We compare the GSI APU against established architectures, including CPUs and GPUs, to quantify its energy efficiency and performance potential. We introduce an analytical framework for general-purpose compute-in-SRAM devices that reveals fundamental optimization principles by modeling performance trade-offs, thereby guiding program optimizations.Exploiting the fine-grained parallelism of tightly integrated memory-compute architectures requires careful data management. We address this by proposing three optimizations: communication-aware reduction mapping, coalesced DMA, and broadcast-friendly data layouts. When applied to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over large corpora (10GB--200GB), these optimizations enable our compute-in-SRAM system to accelerate retrieval by 4.8$\times$--6.6$\times$ over an optimized CPU baseline, improving end-to-end RAG latency by 1.1$\times$--1.8$\times$. The shared off-chip memory bandwidth is modeled using a simulated HBM, while all other components are measured on the real compute-in-SRAM device. Critically, this system matches the performance of an NVIDIA A6000 GPU for RAG while being significantly more energy-efficient (54.4$\times$-117.9$\times$ reduction). These findings validate the viability of compute-in-SRAM for complex, real-world applications and provide guidance for advancing the technology."
2509.05688,"Deep convolution Neural Network (DCNN) has been widely used in computer vision tasks. However, for edge devices even inference has too large computational complexity and data access amount. The inference latency of state-of-the-art models are impractical for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a high utilization energy-aware real-time inference deep convolutional neural network accelerator, which improves the performance of the current accelerators. First, we use the 1x1 size convolution kernel as the smallest unit of the computing unit. Then we design suitable computing unit based on the requirements of each model. Secondly, we use Reuse Feature SRAM to store the output of the current layer in the chip and use the value as the input of the next layer. Moreover, we import Output Reuse Strategy and Ring Stream Dataflow to reduce the amount of data exchange between chips and DRAM. Finally, we present On-fly Pooling Module to let the calculation of the Pooling layer directly complete in the chip. With the aid of the proposed method, the implemented acceleration chip has an extremely high hardware utilization rate. We reduce a generous amount of data transfer on the specific module, ECNN. Compared to the methods without reuse strategy, we can reduce 533 times of data access amount. At the same time, we have enough computing power to perform real-time execution of the existing image classification model, VGG16 and MobileNet. Compared with the design in VWA, we can speed up 7.52 times and have 1.92x energy efficiency"
2509.05937,"Recent developments have introduced Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), an innovative architectural paradigm capable of replicating conventional deep neural network (DNN) capabilities while utilizing significantly reduced parameter counts through the employment of parameterized B-spline functions with trainable coefficients. Nevertheless, the B-spline functional components inherent to KAN architectures introduce distinct hardware acceleration complexities. While B-spline function evaluation can be accomplished through look-up table (LUT) implementations that directly encode functional mappings, thus minimizing computational overhead, such approaches continue to demand considerable circuit infrastructure, including LUTs, multiplexers, decoders, and related components. This work presents an algorithm-hardware co-design approach for KAN acceleration. At the algorithmic level, techniques include Alignment-Symmetry and PowerGap KAN hardware aware quantization, KAN sparsity aware mapping strategy, and circuit-level techniques include N:1 Time Modulation Dynamic Voltage input generator with analog-compute-in-memory (ACIM) circuits. This work conducts evaluations on large-scale KAN networks to validate the proposed methodologies. Non-ideality factors, including partial sum deviations from process variations, have been evaluated with statistics measured from the TSMC 22nm RRAM-ACIM prototype chips. Utilizing optimally determined KAN hyperparameters in conjunction with circuit optimizations fabricated at the 22nm technology node, despite the parameter count for large-scale tasks in this work increasing by 500Kx to 807Kx compared to tiny-scale tasks in previous work, the area overhead increases by only 28Kx to 41Kx, with power consumption rising by merely 51x to 94x, while accuracy degradation remains minimal at 0.11% to 0.23%, demonstrating the scaling potential of our proposed architecture."
2509.06101,"The continuing advancement of memory technology has not only fueled a surge in performance, but also substantially exacerbate reliability challenges. Traditional solutions have primarily focused on improving the efficiency of protection schemes, i.e., Error Correction Codes (ECC), under the assumption that allocating additional memory space for parity data is always expensive and therefore not a scalable solution.We break the stereotype by proposing an orthogonal approach that provides additional, cost-effective memory space for resilient memory design. In particular, we recognize that ECC chips (used for parity storage) do not necessarily require the same performance level as regular data chips. This offers two-fold benefits: First, the bandwidth originally provisioned for a regular-performance ECC chip can instead be used to accommodate multiple low-performance chips. Second, the cost of ECC chips can be effectively reduced, as lower performance often correlates with lower expense. In addition, we observe that server-class memory chips are often provisioned with ample, yet underutilized I/O resources. This further offers the opportunity to repurpose these resources to enable flexible on-DIMM interconnections. Based on the above two insights, we finally propose SCREME, a scalable memory framework leverages cost-effective, albeit slower, chips -- naturally produced during rapid technology evolution -- to meet the growing reliability demands driven by this evolution."
2509.06365,"There is a growing interest in portable MRI (pMRI) systems for point-of-care imaging, particularly in remote or resource-constrained environments. However, the computational complexity of pMRI, especially in image reconstruction and machine learning (ML) algorithms for enhanced imaging, presents significant challenges. Such challenges can be potentially addressed by harnessing hardware application solutions, though there is little focus in the current pMRI literature on hardware acceleration. This paper bridges that gap by reviewing recent developments in pMRI, emphasizing the role and impact of hardware acceleration to speed up image acquisition and reconstruction. Key technologies such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) offer excellent performance in terms of reconstruction speed and power consumption. This review also highlights the promise of AI-powered reconstruction, open low-field pMRI datasets, and innovative edge-based hardware solutions for the future of pMRI technology. Overall, hardware acceleration can enhance image quality, reduce power consumption, and increase portability for next-generation pMRI technology. To accelerate reproducible AI for portable MRI, we propose forming a Low-Field MRI Consortium and an evidence ladder (analytic/phantom validation, retrospective multi-center testing, prospective reader and non-inferiority trials) to provide standardized datasets, benchmarks, and regulator-ready testbeds."

However, the persistent challenge demands analog front-end (AFE) systems with high sensitivity, low power consumption, and minimal calibration requirements to ensure practical usability in wearable technologies. In response to this challenge, this research introduces VCO-CARE, a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator-based Analog Readout tailored for continuous EDA sensing. The results show that our system achieves an exceptional average sensitivity of up to 40 pS within a 0-20 uS range and a negligible relative error of less than 0.0025% for fixed-resistance. Furthermore, the proposed system consumes only an average of 2.3 uW based on post-layout validations and introduces a low noise contribution, measuring only 0.8 uVrms across the 0-1.5 Hz EDA signal band. This research aims to drive the evolution of wearable sensors characterized by seamless adaptability to diverse users, minimal power consumption, and outstanding noise resilience."

2509.08067,"We present the analysis of various FPGA design implementations of a Montgomery Modular Multiplier, compatible with the BLS12-381 elliptic curve, using the Coarsely Integrated Operand Scanning approach of working with complete partial products on different digit sizes. The scope of the implemented designs is to achieve a high-frequency, high-throughput solution capable of computing millions of operations per second, which can provide a strong foundation for different Elliptic Curve Cryptography operations such as point addition and point multiplication. One important constraint for our designs was to only use FPGA DSP primitives for the arithmetic operations between digits employed in the CIOS algorithm as these primitives, when pipelined properly, can operate at a high frequency while also relaxing the resource consumption of FPGA LUTs and FFs. The target of the analysis is to see how different design choices and tool configurations influence the frequency, latency and resource consumption when working with the latest AMD-Xilinx tools and Alveo FPGA boards in an RTL-HLS hybrid approach. We compare three categories of designs: a Verilog naive approach where we rely on the Vivado synthesizer to automatically choose when and where to use DSPs, a Verilog optimized approach by manually instantiating the DSP primitives ourselves and a complete High-Level Synthesis approach. We also compare the FPGA implementations with an optimized software implementation of the same Montgomery multiplier written in Rust."
2509.08193,"We present FlexiFlow, a lifetime-aware design framework for item-level intelligence (ILI) where computation is integrated directly into disposable products like food packaging and medical patches. Our framework leverages natively flexible electronics which offer significantly lower costs than silicon but are limited to kHz speeds and several thousands of gates. Our insight is that unlike traditional computing with more uniform deployment patterns, ILI applications exhibit 1000X variation in operational lifetime, fundamentally changing optimal architectural design decisions when considering trillion-item deployment scales. To enable holistic design and optimization, we model the trade-offs between embodied carbon footprint and operational carbon footprint based on application-specific lifetimes. The framework includes: (1) FlexiBench, a workload suite targeting sustainability applications from spoilage detection to health monitoring; (2) FlexiBits, area-optimized RISC-V cores with 1/4/8-bit datapaths achieving 2.65X to 3.50X better energy efficiency per workload execution; and (3) a carbon-aware model that selects optimal architectures based on deployment characteristics. We show that lifetime-aware microarchitectural design can reduce carbon footprint by 1.62X, while algorithmic decisions can reduce carbon footprint by 14.5X. We validate our approach through the first tape-out using a PDK for flexible electronics with fully open-source tools, achieving 30.9kHz operation. FlexiFlow enables exploration of computing at the Extreme Edge where conventional design methodologies must be reevaluated to account for new constraints and considerations."

However, traditional workflows defer validation process until RTL design and SoC integration are complete, significantly prolonging development and iteration cycle.In this work, we present FASE framework, FPGA-Assisted Syscall Emulation, the first work for adapt syscall emulation on FPGA platforms, enabling complex multi-thread benchmarks to directly run on the processor design without integrating SoC or target OS for early-stage performance validation. FASE introduces three key innovations to address three critical challenges for adapting FPGA-based syscall emulation: (1) only a minimal CPU interface is exposed, with other hardware components untouched, addressing the lack of a unified hardware interface in FPGA systems; (2) a Host-Target Protocol (HTP) is proposed to minimize cross-device data traffic, mitigating the low-bandwidth and high-latency communication between FPGA and host; and (3) a host-side runtime is proposed to remotely handle Linux-style system calls, addressing the challenge of cross-device syscall delegation.Experiments ware conducted on Xilinx FPGA with open-sourced RISC-V SMP processor Rocket. With single-thread CoreMark, FASE introduces less than 1% performance error and achieves over 2000x higher efficiency compared to Proxy Kernel due to FPGA acceleration. With complex OpenMP benchmarks, FASE demonstrates over 96% performance validation accuracy for most single-thread workloads and over 91.5% for most multi-thread workloads compared to full SoC validation, significantly reducing development complexity and time-to-feedback.

2509.08416,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating software code for high-level programming languages such as Python and C++. However, their application to hardware description languages, such as Verilog, is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training data. Current approaches to Verilog code generation using LLMs often focus on syntactic correctness, resulting in code with functional errors. To address these challenges, we present AutoVeriFix, a novel Python-assisted two-stage framework designed to enhance the functional correctness of LLM-generated Verilog code. In the first stage, LLMs are employed to generate high-level Python reference models that define the intended circuit behavior. In the second stage, these Python models facilitate the creation of automated tests that guide the generation of Verilog RTL implementations. Simulation discrepancies between the reference model and the Verilog code are iteratively used to identify and correct errors, thereby improving the functional accuracy and reliability of the LLM-generated Verilog code. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in improving the functional correctness of generated Verilog code."
2509.08542,"Compute-in-Read-Only-Memory (CiROM) accelerators offer outstanding energy efficiency for CNNs by eliminating runtime weight updates. However, their scalability to Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by their vast parameter sizes. Notably, LLaMA-7B - the smallest model in LLaMA series - demands more than 1,000 cm2 of silicon area even in advanced CMOS nodes. This paper presents BitROM, the first CiROM-based accelerator that overcomes this limitation through co-design with BitNet's 1.58-bit quantization model, enabling practical and efficient LLM inference at the edge. BitROM introduces three key innovations: 1) a novel Bidirectional ROM Array that stores two ternary weights per transistor; 2) a Tri-Mode Local Accumulator optimized for ternary-weight computations; and 3) an integrated Decode-Refresh (DR) eDRAM that supports on-die KV-cache management, significantly reducing external memory access during decoding. In addition, BitROM integrates LoRA-based adapters to enable efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. Evaluated in 65nm CMOS, BitROM achieves 20.8 TOPS/W and a bit density of 4,967 kB/mm2 - offering a 10x improvement in area efficiency over prior digital CiROM designs.

2509.09505,"LLMs now form the backbone of AI agents for a diverse array of applications, including tool use, command-line agents, and web or computer use agents. These agentic LLM inference tasks are fundamentally different from chatbot-focused inference -- they often have much larger context lengths to capture complex, prolonged inputs, such as entire webpage DOMs or complicated tool call trajectories. This, in turn, generates significant off-chip memory traffic for the underlying hardware at the inference stage and causes the workload to be constrained by two memory walls, namely the bandwidth and capacity memory walls, preventing the on-chip compute units from achieving high utilization.In this paper, we introduce PLENA, a hardware-software co-designed system that applies three core optimization pathways to tackle these challenges. PLENA includes an efficient hardware implementation of compute and memory units supporting an asymmetric quantization scheme. PLENA also features a novel flattened systolic array architecture that has native support for FlashAttention to tackle these memory walls in the scenario of inference serving for long-context LLMs. Additionally, PLENA is developed with a complete stack, including a custom ISA, a compiler, a cycle-emulated simulator, and an automated design space exploration flow. The simulated results show that PLENA achieves up to 8.5x higher utilization than existing accelerators, and delivers 2.24x higher throughput than the A100 GPU and 3.85x higher throughput than the TPU v6e, under the same multiplier count and memory settings.

2509.09774,"Developing efficient hardware accelerators for mathematical kernels used in scientific applications and machine learning has traditionally been a labor-intensive task. These accelerators typically require low-level programming in Verilog or other hardware description languages, along with significant manual optimization effort. Recently, to alleviate this challenge, high-level hardware design tools like Chisel and High-Level Synthesis have emerged. However, as with any compiler, some of the generated hardware may be suboptimal compared to expert-crafted designs. Understanding where these inefficiencies arise is crucial, as it provides valuable insights for both users and tool developers. In this paper, we propose a methodology to hierarchically decompose mathematical kernels - such as Fourier transforms, matrix multiplication, and QR factorization - into a set of common building blocks or primitives. Then the primitives are implemented in the different programming environments, and the larger algorithms get assembled. Furthermore, we employ an automatic approach to investigate the achievable frequency and required resources. Performing this experimentation at each level will provide fairer comparisons between designs and offer guidance for both tool developers and hardware designers to adopt better practices."

Finesse leverages a co-optimization cycle driven by a specialized compiler and a multi-granularity hardware simulator, enabling both optimized performance metrics and effective design space exploration. Furthermore, Finesse adopts a modular design flow to significantly shorten design cycles, while its versatile abstraction ensures flexibility across various curve families and hardware architectures.Finesse offers flexibility, efficiency, and rapid prototyping, comparing with previous frameworks. With compilation times reduced to minutes, Finesse enables faster iteration cycles and streamlined hardware-software co-design. Experiments on popular curves demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving $34\times$ improvement in throughput and $6.2\times$ increase in area efficiency compared to previous flexible frameworks, while outperforming state-of-the-art non-flexible ASIC designs with a $3\times$ gain in throughput and $3.2\times$ improvement in area efficiency."

This highlights the need for a versatile compute-memory efficient accelerator. Unfortunately, existing Transformer accelerators struggle to address both aspects simultaneously, as they focus on value-level processing, missing fine-grained opportunities to optimize computation and memory collaboratively. This paper introduces MCBP, a bit-grained compute-memory efficient algorithm-hardware co-design that leverages bit-slice (BS) enabled repetitiveness and sparsity to accelerate LLM inference. MCBP features three key innovations: 1) BS-repetitiveness-enabled computation reduction (BRCR), which eliminates redundant GEMM computations via leveraging redundancy hidden among BS vectors; 2) BS-sparsity-enabled two-state coding (BSTC), which reduces weight access via exploiting significant sparsity in high-order bit-slice weight; 3) Bit-grained progressive prediction (BGPP), which reduces KV cache access by leveraging early-termination-based bit-grained prediction. These techniques, supported by custom accelerator designs, effectively alleviate the burden in GEMM, weight access, and KV cache access. Extensive experiments on 26 benchmarks show that MCBP achieves 9.43x speed up and 31.1x higher energy efficiency than Nvidia A100 GPU.

The increasing complexity of processor designs and the emergence of new instruction set architectures (ISAs) like RISC-V have created demands for more agile and efficient verification methodologies, particularly regarding verification efficiency and faster coverage convergence. While simulation-based approaches now attempt to incorporate advanced software testing techniques such as fuzzing to improve coverage, they face significant limitations when applied to processor verification, notably poor performance and inadequate test case quality. Hardware-accelerated solutions using FPGA or ASIC platforms have tried to address these issues, yet they struggle with challenges including host-FPGA communication overhead, inefficient test pattern generation, and suboptimal implementation of the entire multi-step verification process.In this paper, we present TurboFuzz, an end-to-end hardware-accelerated verification framework that implements the entire Test Generation-Simulation-Coverage Feedback loop on a single FPGA for modern processor verification. TurboFuzz enhances test quality through optimized test case (seed) control flow, efficient inter-seed scheduling, and hybrid fuzzer integration, thereby improving coverage and execution efficiency. Additionally, it employs a feedback-driven generation mechanism to accelerate coverage convergence. Experimental results show that TurboFuzz achieves up to 2.23x more coverage collection than software-based fuzzers within the same time budget, and up to 571x performance speedup when detecting real-world issues, while maintaining full visibility and debugging capabilities with moderate area overhead."
2509.10627,"Deep learning-based recommendation models (DLRMs) are widely deployed in commercial applications to enhance user experience. However, the large and sparse embedding layers in these models impose substantial memory bandwidth bottlenecks due to high memory access costs and irregular access patterns, leading to increased inference time and energy consumption. While resistive random access memory (ReRAM) based crossbars offer a fast and energy-efficient solution through in-memory embedding reduction operations, naively mapping embeddings onto crossbar arrays leads to poor crossbar utilization and thus degrades performance. We present ReCross, an efficient ReRAM-based in-memory computing (IMC) scheme designed to minimize execution time and enhance energy efficiency in DLRM embedding reduction. ReCross co-optimizes embedding access patterns and ReRAM crossbar characteristics by intelligently grouping and mapping co-occurring embeddings, replicating frequently accessed embeddings across crossbars, and dynamically selecting in-memory processing operations using a newly designed dynamic switch ADC circuit that considers runtime energy trade-offs. Experimental results demonstrate that ReCross achieves a 3.97x reduction in execution time and a 6.1x improvement in energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art IMC approaches."
2509.10702,"In the hardware design space exploration process, it is critical to optimize both hardware parameters and algorithm-to-hardware mappings. Previous work has largely approached this simultaneous optimization problem by separately exploring the hardware design space and the mapspace - both individually large and highly nonconvex spaces - independently. The resulting combinatorial explosion has created significant difficulties for optimizers.In this paper, we introduce DOSA, which consists of differentiable performance models and a gradient descent-based optimization technique to simultaneously explore both spaces and identify high-performing design points. Experimental results demonstrate that DOSA outperforms random search and Bayesian optimization by 2.80x and 12.59x, respectively, in improving DNN model energy-delay product, given a similar number of samples. We also demonstrate the modularity and flexibility of DOSA by augmenting our analytical model with a learned model, allowing us to optimize buffer sizes and mappings of a real DNN accelerator and attain a 1.82x improvement in energy-delay product."
2509.10751,"The Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard significantly improves compression efficiency over its predecessor, HEVC, but at the cost of substantially higher computational complexity, particularly in intra-frame prediction. This stage employs various directional modes, each requiring multiple multiplications between reference samples and constant coefficients. To optimize these operations at hardware accelerators, multiplierless constant multiplication (MCM) blocks offer a promising solution. However, VVC's interpolation filters have more than fifty distinct coefficients, making MCM implementations resource-intensive. This work proposes an approximation method to reduce the number of interpolation coefficients by averaging fixed subsets of them, therefore decreasing MCM block size and potentially lowering circuit area and power consumption. Six different MCM block architectures for angular intra prediction are introduced, in which five use the approximation method introduced in this work, and evaluate the trade-off between coefficient reduction and coding efficiency compared with a conventional multiplier architecture. Experimental results in ten videos demonstrate that only two MCM implementations exceed a 4% BD-Rate increase and 2.6% on average in the worst case, while two of the MCM implementations have circuit area reduction of 20% and 44%. For three of the architectures, parallel sample prediction modules were synthesized, showing a reduction of 30% gate area compared to single sample processing units, and a reduction in energy consumption for two of the implementations."
2509.11503,"We present a design for an extensible video conferencing stack implemented entirely in hardware on a Nexys4 DDR FPGA, which uses the M-JPEG codec to compress video and a UDP networking stack to communicate between the FPGA and the receiving computer. This networking stack accepts real-time updates from both the video codec and the audio controller, which means that video will be able to be streamed at 30 FPS from the FPGA to a computer. On the computer side, a Python script reads the Ethernet packets and decodes the packets into the video and the audio for real time playback. We evaluate this architecture using both functional, simulation-driven verification in Cocotb and by synthesizing SystemVerilog RTL code using Vivado for deployment on our Nexys4 DDR FPGA, where we evaluate both end-to-end latency and throughput of video transmission."
2509.11529,"Solving sparse systems of linear equations is a fundamental problem in the field of numerical methods, with applications spanning from circuit design to urban planning. These problems can have millions of constraints, such as when laying out transistors on a circuit, or trying to optimize traffic light timings, making fast sparse solvers extremely important. However, existing state-of-the-art software-level solutions for solving sparse linear systems, termed iterative solvers, are extremely inefficient on current hardware. This inefficiency can be attributed to two key reasons: (1) poor short-term data reuse, which causes frequent, irregular memory accesses, and (2) complex data dependencies, which limit parallelism. Hence, in this paper, we present an FPGA implementation of the existing Azul accelerator, an SRAM-only hardware accelerator that achieves both high memory bandwidth utilization and arithmetic intensity. Azul features a grid of tiles, each of which is composed of a processing element (PE) and a small independent SRAM memory, which are all connected over a network on chip (NoC). We implement Azul on FPGA using simple RISC-V CPU cores connected to a memory hierarchy of different FPGA memory modules. We utilize custom RISC-V ISA augmentations to implement a task-based programming model for the various PEs, allowing communication over the NoC. Finally, we design simple distributed test cases so that we can functionally verify the FPGA implementation, verifying equivalent performance to an architectural simulation of the Azul framework."
2509.12053,"Modern tensor applications, especially foundation models and generative AI applications require multiple input modalities (both vision and language), which increases the demand for flexible accelerator architecture. Existing frameworks suffer from the trade-off between design flexibility and productivity of RTL generation: either limited to very few hand-written templates or cannot automatically generate the RTL. To address this challenge, we propose the LEGO framework, which targets tensor applications and automatically generates spatial architecture design and outputs synthesizable RTL code without handwritten RTL design templates. Leveraging the affine-transformation-based architecture representation, LEGO front end finds interconnections between function units, synthesizes the memory system, and fuses different spatial dataflow designs based on data reuse analysis. LEGO back end then translates the hardware in a primitive-level graph to perform lower-level optimizations, and applies a set of linear-programming algorithms to optimally insert pipeline registers and reduce the overhead of unused logic when switching spatial dataflows. Our evaluation demonstrates that LEGO can achieve 3.2x speedup and 2.4x energy efficiency compared to previous work Gemmini, and can generate one architecture for diverse modern foundation models in generative AI applications."
2509.12676,"In the era of cloud computing, privacy-preserving computation offloading is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables secure processing of encrypted data, but the inherent computational complexity of FHE operations introduces significant computational overhead on the server side. FHE schemes often face a tradeoff between efficiency and versatility. While the CKKS scheme is highly efficient for polynomial operations, it lacks the flexibility of the binary TFHE (Torus-FHE) scheme, which offers greater versatility but at the cost of efficiency. The recent multi-bit TFHE extension offers greater flexibility and performance by supporting native non-polynomial operations and efficient integer processing. However, current implementations of multi-bit TFHE are constrained by its narrower numeric representation, which prevents its adoption in applications requiring wider numeric representations.To address this challenge, we introduce Taurus, a hardware accelerator designed to enhance the efficiency of multi-bit TFHE computations. Taurus supports ciphertexts up to 10 bits by leveraging novel FFT units and optimizing memory bandwidth through key reuse strategies. We also propose a compiler with operation deduplication to improve memory utilization. Our experiment results demonstrate that Taurus achieves up to 2600x speedup over a CPU, 1200x speedup over a GPU, and up to 7x faster compared to the previous state-of-the-art TFHE accelerator. Moreover, Taurus is the first accelerator to demonstrate privacy-preserving inference with large language models such as GPT-2. These advancements enable more practical and scalable applications of privacy-preserving computation in cloud environments."
2509.12993,"The deployment of large language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges due to their enormous memory footprints, low arithmetic intensity, and stringent latency requirements, particularly during the autoregressive decoding stage. Traditional compute-centric accelerators, such as GPUs, suffer from severe resource underutilization and memory bandwidth bottlenecks in these memory-bound workloads. To overcome these fundamental limitations, we propose HPIM, the first memory-centric heterogeneous Processing-In-Memory (PIM) accelerator that integrates SRAM-PIM and HBM-PIM subsystems designed specifically for LLM inference. HPIM employs a software-hardware co-design approach that combines a specialized compiler framework with a heterogeneous hardware architecture. It intelligently partitions workloads based on their characteristics: latency-critical attention operations are mapped to the SRAM-PIM subsystem to exploit its ultra-low latency and high computational flexibility, while weight-intensive GEMV computations are assigned to the HBM-PIM subsystem to leverage its high internal bandwidth and large storage capacity. Furthermore, HPIM introduces a tightly coupled pipeline strategy across SRAM-PIM and HBM-PIM subsystems to maximize intra-token parallelism, thereby significantly mitigating serial dependency of the autoregressive decoding stage. Comprehensive evaluations using a cycle-accurate simulator demonstrate that HPIM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art accelerators, achieving a peak speedup of up to 22.8x compared to the NVIDIA A100 GPU. Moreover, HPIM exhibits superior performance over contemporary PIM-based accelerators, highlighting its potential as a highly practical and scalable solution for accelerating large-scale LLM inference."
2509.13029,"With the diminishing return from Moore's Law, system-technology co-optimization (STCO) has emerged as a promising approach to sustain the scaling trends in the VLSI industry. By bridging the gap between system requirements and technology innovations, STCO enables customized optimizations for application-driven system architectures. However, existing research lacks sufficient discussion on efficient STCO methodologies, particularly in addressing the information gap across design hierarchies and navigating the expansive cross-layer design space. To address these challenges, this paper presents Orthrus, a dual-loop automated framework that synergizes system-level and technology-level optimizations. At the system level, Orthrus employs a novel mechanism to prioritize the optimization of critical standard cells using system-level statistics. It also guides technology-level optimization via the normal directions of the Pareto frontier efficiently explored by Bayesian optimization. At the technology level, Orthrus leverages system-aware insights to optimize standard cell libraries. It employs a neural network-assisted enhanced differential evolution algorithm to efficiently optimize technology parameters. Experimental results on 7nm technology demonstrate that Orthrus achieves 12.5% delay reduction at iso-power and 61.4% power savings at iso-delay over the baseline approaches, establishing new Pareto frontiers in STCO."

By supporting reconfiguration at the functional unit level, CGRAs efficiently adapt to varying computational patterns and optimize resource utilization. However, designing CGRAs is highly challenging due to the vast design space, independent architectural parameters, and the time-consuming nature of manual design. Fortunately, the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to automate this process.In this work, we propose MALTA-- an open-source multi-agent LLM-based framework for Hardware/Software (HW/SW) co-design of CGRAs. The framework employs LLM reasoning to generate CGRAs across four stages: HW/SW co-design, Design error correction, Best design selection, and Evaluation & Feedback. Furthermore, MALTA iteratively optimizes the generated CGRAs, leveraging agent reasoning and feedback to achieve higher PPA (that is, power, performance, and area) design points for a given domain. In addition, we introduce an LLM self-learning mechanism that employs LLM-driven decision making to select the optimal CGRA to accelerate the design process.We evaluate the framework with state-of-the-art LLM-based methods and manual CGRA design, in terms of performance, power consumption, and area. Experimental results show that MALTA efficiently generates high-quality CGRA architectures, significantly reducing manual design effort and demonstrating the potential of our framework for real-world CGRA design."

While streaming intermediate results between computation kernels can significantly improve efficiency, existing approaches struggle with inter-kernel correlations, external memory access management, and buffer optimization. In this work, we propose StreamTensor, a compiler framework that automatically constructs and optimizes stream-based dataflow accelerators. StreamTensor introduces a novel iterative tensor type system to explicitly encode stream layouts, enabling seamless kernel fusion, buffer allocation, and memory optimization. By systematically exploring three hierarchical design spaces, including tensor tiling, kernel fusion, and resource allocation, StreamTensor balances computational intensity, memory efficiency, and data streaming to maximize performance. Based on FPGA evaluations on Large Language Models (LLM), StreamTensor achieves up to 0.76x and 0.64x lower latency compared to the state-of-the-art FPGA LLM accelerators and GPUs, and up to 1.99x higher energy efficiency compared to GPUs, making it a promising approach for scalable dataflow-based deep learning acceleration."
2509.1371,"The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized various aspects of human life, yet their immense computational and energy demands pose significant challenges for efficient inference. The memory wall, the growing processor-memory speed disparity, remains a critical bottleneck for LLM. Process-In-Memory (PIM) architectures overcome limitations by co-locating compute units with memory, leveraging 5-20$\times$ higher internal bandwidth and enabling greater energy efficiency than GPUs. However, existing PIMs struggle to balance flexibility, performance, and cost-efficiency for LLMs' dynamic memory-compute patterns and operator diversity. DRAM-PIM suffers from inter-bank communication overhead despite its vector parallelism. SRAM-PIM offers sub-10ns latency for matrix operation but is constrained by limited capacity. This work introduces CompAir, a novel PIM architecture that integrates DRAM-PIM and SRAM-PIM with hybrid bonding, enabling efficient linear computations while unlocking multi-granularity data pathways. We further develop CompAir-NoC, an advanced network-on-chip with an embedded arithmetic logic unit that performs non-linear operations during data movement, simultaneously reducing communication overhead and area cost. Finally, we develop a hierarchical Instruction Set Architecture that ensures both flexibility and programmability of the hybrid PIM. Experimental results demonstrate that CompAir achieves 1.83-7.98$\times$ prefill and 1.95-6.28$\times$ decode improvement over the current state-of-the-art fully PIM architecture. Compared to the hybrid A100 and HBM-PIM system, CompAir achieves 3.52$\times$ energy consumption reduction with comparable throughput. This work represents the first systematic exploration of hybrid DRAM-PIM and SRAM-PIM architectures with in-network computation capabilities, offering a high-efficiency solution for LLM."
2509.13765,"Ternary quantization has emerged as a powerful technique for reducing both computational and memory footprint of large language models (LLM), enabling efficient real-time inference deployment without significantly compromising model accuracy. Conventional LLM inference platforms (e.g GPUs) cannot capitalize on its benefits, as they (i) lack native support for ternary arithmetic and memory specialization and (ii) remain severely under-utilized in low-batch, real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose TENET, a sparse-aware LUT-centric architecture that co-optimizes algorithm, compute, and memory for ternary LLM inference. To maximize the efficiency of Ternary Linear layer, TENET introduces a Sparse Ternary LUT (STL) core that optimizes ternary mixed-precision GEMM using a symmetric precompute lookup table. It also features Dynamic Activation N:M Sparsity to exploit the sparsity within the activation of each token. Additionally, we propose a LUT-based 64B:80B ternary weight decompression module to fully exploit the memory efficiency of ternary values. At the system level, we design a heterogeneous TENET accelerator with full programmability that integrates STL cores with high-precision cores. An associated Linear-Projection-aware Sparse Attention dataflow is introduced to optimize memory access and hardware utilization. We implement TENET accelerator prototype on both FPGA and ASIC platforms. Experiments across various model sizes and workloads demonstrate that TENET-FPGA and TENET-ASIC improve energy efficiency by 4.3$\times$ and 21.1$\times$, respectively, compared to the A100 GPU. Furthermore, TENET-ASIC achieves a 2.7$\times$ average speedup compared to the A100 GPU in end-to-end inference latency."
2509.13997,"AI training and inference impose sustained, fine-grain I/O that stresses host-mediated, TCP-based storage paths. Motivated by kernel-bypass networking and user-space storage stacks, we revisit POSIX-compatible object storage for GPU-centric pipelines. We present ROS2, an RDMA-first object storage system design that offloads the DAOS client to an NVIDIA BlueField-3 SmartNIC while leaving the DAOS I/O engine unchanged on the storage server. ROS2 separates a lightweight control plane (gRPC for namespace and capability exchange) from a high-throughput data plane (UCX/libfabric over RDMA or TCP) and removes host mediation from the data path.Using FIO/DFS across local and remote configurations, we find that on server-grade CPUs RDMA consistently outperforms TCP for both large sequential and small random I/O. When the RDMA-driven DAOS client is offloaded to BlueField-3, end-to-end performance is comparable to the host, demonstrating that SmartNIC offload preserves RDMA efficiency while enabling DPU-resident features such as multi-tenant isolation and inline services (e.g., encryption/decryption) close to the NIC. In contrast, TCP on the SmartNIC lags host performance, underscoring the importance of RDMA for offloaded deployments.Overall, our results indicate that an RDMA-first, SmartNIC-offloaded object-storage stack is a practical foundation for scaling data delivery in modern LLM training environments; integrating optional GPU-direct placement for LLM tasks is left for future work."
2509.14041,"Modern mobile CPU software pose challenges for conventional instruction cache replacement policies due to their complex runtime behavior causing high reuse distance between executions of the same instruction. Mobile code commonly suffers from large amounts of stalls in the CPU frontend and thus starvation of the rest of the CPU resources. Complexity of these applications and their code footprint are projected to grow at a rate faster than available on-chip memory due to power and area constraints, making conventional hardware-centric methods for managing instruction caches to be inadequate. We present a novel software-hardware co-design approach called TRRIP (Temperature-based Re-Reference Interval Prediction) that enables the compiler to analyze, classify, and transform code based on ""temperature"" (hot/cold), and to provide the hardware with a summary of code temperature information through a well-defined OS interface based on using code page attributes. TRRIP's lightweight hardware extension employs code temperature attributes to optimize the instruction cache replacement policy resulting in the eviction rate reduction of hot code. TRRIP is designed to be practical and adoptable in real mobile systems that have strict feature requirements on both the software and hardware components. TRRIP can reduce the L2 MPKI for instructions by 26.5% resulting in geomean speedup of 3.9%, on top of RRIP cache replacement running mobile code already optimized using PGO."

2509.14551,"The chip design process involves numerous steps, beginning with defining product requirements and progressing through architectural planning, system-level design, and the physical layout of individual circuit blocks. As the enablers of large-scale chip development, Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools play a vital role in helping designers achieve high-quality results. The Shift-Left methodology introduces a pathway toward creating digital twins and fusing multiple design steps, thereby transitioning traditionally sequential, physically-aware processes into virtual design environments. This shift allows designers to establish stronger correlations earlier and optimize designs more effectively. However, challenges remain, especially in accurately replicating downstream behaviors and determining the right scope and timing for adoption. These challenges, in turn, have revealed new opportunities for EDA vendors, physical designers, and logic designers alike. As the industry advances toward intelligent EDA tools and techniques, it is timely to reflect on Shift-Left progress made and the challenges that remain. The rise of AI techniques and the momentum of open-source design flows have significantly strengthened prediction and modeling capabilities, making data-driven methods increasingly relevant to the EDA community. This, in turn, enhances the ''Shift-Left'' features embedded in current tools. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of existing and emerging paradigms in Shift-Left research within EDA and the broader design ecosystem. Our goal is to provide a unique perspective on the state of the field and its future directions. Relevant papers mentioned are organized inthis https URL."
2509.14668,"Assertion-Based Verification (ABV) is a crucial method for ensuring that logic designs conform to their architectural specifications. However, existing assertion generation methods primarily rely on information either from the design specification, or register-transfer level (RTL) code. The former methods are typically limited to generating assertions for the top-level design. As the top-level design is composed of different modules without module-level specifications, they are unable to generate deep assertions that target the internal functionality of modules. The latter methods often rely on a golden RTL model, which is difficult to obtain. To address the above limitations, this paper presents a novel large language model (LLM)-aided verification framework named DeepAssert. DeepAssert is capable of analyzing the invocation relationships between modules and extracting independent specifications for each module with its I/O port information. These extracted specifications are subsequently used to guide LLMs to automatically generate fine-grained deep assertions for these modules. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepAssert significantly outperforms existing methods such as AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion in generating high-quality deep assertions for modules. Furthermore, when integrated with these methods, DeepAssert can enhance the overall quality of the assertions generated. This allows for a more comprehensive and effective verification process."

The architecture is evaluated on Llama 1B/8B/13B models and shows $\sim$2.55$\times$ throughput (tokens/sec) improvement and $\sim$71.94$\times$ energy efficiency (tokens/Joule) boost compared to the A100 GPU."
2509.15036,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising alternative to artificial neural networks (ANNs), offering improved energy efficiency by leveraging sparse and event-driven computation. However, existing hardware implementations of SNNs still suffer from the inherent spike sparsity and multi-timestep execution, which significantly increase latency and reduce energy efficiency. This study presents NEURAL, a novel neuromorphic architecture based on a hybrid data-event execution paradigm by decoupling sparsity-aware processing from neuron computation and using elastic first-in-first-out (FIFO). NEURAL supports on-the-fly execution of spiking QKFormer by embedding its operations within the baseline computing flow without requiring dedicated hardware units. It also integrates a novel window-to-time-to-first-spike (W2TTFS) mechanism to replace average pooling and enable full-spike execution. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation (KD)-based training framework to construct single-timestep SNN models with competitive accuracy. NEURAL is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA and evaluated using ResNet-11, QKFResNet-11, and VGG-11. Experimental results demonstrate that, at the algorithm level, the VGG-11 model trained with KD improves accuracy by 3.20% on CIFAR-10 and 5.13% on CIFAR-100.

However, designing these accelerators is a time-consuming, labor-intensive process that does not scale well. While prior efforts have sought to automate DNN accelerator generation, they offer limited parameterization, cannot produce high-performance, tapeout-ready designs, provide limited support for datatypes and quantization schemes, and lack an integrated, end-to-end software compiler. This work proposes Voyager, a high-level synthesis (HLS)-based framework for design space exploration (DSE) and generation of DNN accelerators. Voyager overcomes the limitations of prior work by offering extensive configurability across technology nodes, clock frequencies, and scales, with customizable parameters such as number of processing elements, on-chip buffer sizes, and external memory bandwidth. Voyager supports a wider variety of datatypes and quantization schemes versus prior work, including both built-in floating-point, posit and integer formats, as well as user-defined formats with both per-tensor scaling and microscaling quantization. Voyager's PyTorch-based compiler efficiently maps networks end-to-end on the generated hardware, with support for quantization, fusion, and tiling. We evaluate Voyager on state-of-the-art vision and language models. Voyager enables fast DSE with full-dataset accuracy evaluation for datatypes and quantization schemes. Generated designs achieve a high utilization across models and scales, up to 99.8%, and outperform prior generators with up to 61% lower latency and 56% lower area.

One of the most important challenges of designing an ASIP is to find said custom instructions that help to increase performance without being too costly in terms of area and power consumption. To date, solving this challenge is relatively labor-intensive and typically performed manually. Addressing the lack of automation, we present Custom Instruction Designer for RISC-V Extensions (CIDRE), a front-to-back tool for ASIP design. CIDRE automatically analyzes hotspots in RISC-V applications and generates custom instruction suggestions with a corresponding nML description. The nML description can be used with other electronic design automation tools to accurately assess the cost and benefits of the found suggestions.

2509.17731,"This work introduces a novel methodology for designing biologically plausible bursting neuron circuits using a minimal number of components. We hypothesize that to design circuits capable of bursting, the neuron circuit design must mimic a neuron model that inherently exhibits bursting dynamics. Consequently, classical models such as the Hodgkin-Huxley, $I_{Na,p}+I_{K}$, and FitzHugh-Nagumo models are not suitable choices. Instead, we propose a methodology for designing neuron circuits that emulate the qualitative characteristics of the $I_{Na,p}+I_{K}+I_{K(M)}$ model, a well-established minimal bursting neuron model. Based on this methodology, we present two novel MOSFET-based circuits that exhibit bursting. Using the method of dissection of neural bursting, we demonstrate that the nullcline and bifurcation diagrams of the fast subsystem in our circuits are qualitatively equivalent to those of the $I_{Na,p}+I_{K}+I_{K(M)}$ model. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the type of bifurcation at burst initiation and termination on the bursting characteristics, showing that our circuits can exhibit diverse bursting behaviours.

Monolithic SoC designs struggle with this complex balance mainly due to low manufacturing yields (below 16%) at advanced 360 mm^2 process nodes. This paper presents a novel chiplet-based RISC-V SoC architecture that addresses these limitations through modular AI acceleration and intelligent system level optimization. Our proposed design integrates 4 different key innovations in a 30mm x 30mm silicon interposer: adaptive cross-chiplet Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS); AI-aware Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) protocol extensions featuring streaming flow control units and compression-aware transfers; distributed cryptographic security across heterogeneous chiplets; and intelligent sensor-driven load migration. The proposed architecture integrates a 7nm RISC-V CPU chiplet with dual 5nm AI accelerators (15 TOPS INT8 each), 16GB HBM3 memory stacks, and dedicated power management controllers. Experimental results across industry standard benchmarks like MobileNetV2, ResNet-50 and real-time video processing demonstrate significant performance improvements. The AI-optimized configuration achieves ~14.7% latency reduction, 17.3% throughput improvement, and 16.2% power reduction compared to previous basic chiplet implementations. These improvements collectively translate to a 40.1% efficiency gain corresponding to ~3.5 mJ per MobileNetV2 inference (860 mW/244 images/s), while maintaining sub-5ms real-time capability across all experimented workloads. These performance upgrades demonstrate that modular chiplet designs can achieve near-monolithic computational density while enabling cost efficiency, scalability and upgradeability, crucial for next-generation edge AI device applications."

2509.19873,"The growing demand for efficient long-sequence modeling on edge devices has propelled widespread adoption of State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, due to their superior computational efficiency and scalability. As its autoregressive generation process remains memory-bound, speculative decoding has been proposed that incorporates draft model generation and target model verification. However, directly applying speculative decoding to SSMs faces three key challenges: (1) hidden state backtracking difficulties, (2) tree-based parallel verification incompatibility, and (3) hardware workload mismatch. To address these challenges, we propose SpecMamba, the first FPGA-based accelerator for Mamba with speculative decoding, which features system, algorithm, and hardware co-design. At the system level, we present a memory-aware hybrid backtracking strategy to coordinate both models. At the algorithm level, we propose first-in-first-out (FIFO)-based tree verification with tiling to minimize memory access.

This work-in-progress paper presents an adaptive, many-sided Rowhammer attack utilizing GPU compute shaders to systematically achieve high-frequency memory access patterns. Our approach employs statistical distributions to optimize row targeting and avoid current mitigations. The methodology involves initializing memory with known patterns, iteratively hammering victim rows, monitoring for induced errors, and dynamically adjusting parameters to maximize success rates. The proposed attack exploits the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs to accelerate hammering operations, thereby increasing the probability of successful bit flips within a constrained timeframe. By leveraging OpenGL compute shaders, our implementation achieves highly efficient row hammering with minimal software overhead. Experimental results on a Raspberry Pi 4 demonstrate that the GPU-based approach attains a high rate of bit flips compared to traditional CPU-based hammering, confirming its effectiveness in compromising DRAM integrity. Our findings align with existing research on microarchitectural attacks in heterogeneous systems that highlight the susceptibility of GPUs to security vulnerabilities.

However, for specialized domains such as program synthesis, the relative scarcity of HDL and proprietary EDA resources online compared to more common programming tasks introduces challenges, often necessitating task-specific fine-tuning, high inference costs, and manually-crafted agent orchestration. In this work, we present VeriMaAS, a multi-agent framework designed to automatically compose agentic workflows for RTL code generation. Our key insight is to integrate formal verification feedback from HDL tools directly into workflow generation, reducing the cost of gradient-based updates or prolonged reasoning traces. Our method improves synthesis performance by 5-7% for pass@k over fine-tuned baselines, while requiring only a few hundred training examples, representing an order-of-magnitude reduction in supervision cost."
2509.20514,"While most instruction set architectures (ISAs) are only available to use through the purchase of a restrictive commercial license, the RISC-V ISA presents a free and open-source alternative. Due to this availability, many free and open-source implementations have been developed and can be accessed on platforms such as GitHub. If an open source, easy-to-use, and robust RISC-V implementation could be obtained, it could be easily adapted for pedagogical and amateur use. In this work we accomplish three goals in relation to this outlook. First, we propose a set of criteria for evaluating the components of a RISC-V implementation's ecosystem from a pedagogical perspective. Second, we analyze a number of existing open-source RISC-V implementations to determine how many of the criteria they fulfill. We then develop a comprehensive solution that meets all of these criterion and is released open-source for other instructors to use. The framework is developed in a composable way that it's different components can be disaggregated per individual course needs. Finally, we also report on a limited study of student feedback."
2509.20543,"As processors increase in complexity, costs grow even more rapidly, both for functional verification and performance validation. Most often, silicon characterizations comprise simple performance counters, which are aggregated and separated to tell a story. Based on these inferences, performance engineers employ microarchitectural simulation to inspect deeply into the core. Unfortunately, dramatically longer runtimes make simulation infeasible for long workloads.We propose a Scale-Down approach to modelling and validation. Rather than up-sizing a prototyping platform to fit large and complex system designs, we show that it can be more accurate, faster, and more economical to decompose a system into manageable sub-components that can be prototyped independently. By carefully designing the prototyping interface, it is possible to adhere to strict non-interference of the Device Under Test (DUT). This allows architects to have the best of both worlds: the speed of FPGA acceleration while eliminating the inaccuracies of Scale-Out and the inherent costs of Scale-Up.In this work, we present ZynqParrot: a Scale-Down FPGA-based modelling platform, capable of executing non-interfering, cycle-accurate co-emulations of arbitrary RTL designs. ZynqParrot is capable of verifying functionality and performance with arbitrary granularity. We also provide case studies using ZynqParrot to analyze the full-stack performance of an open-source RISC-V processor."
2509.21762,"GPUs are the dominant platform for many important applications today including deep learning, accelerated computing, and scientific simulation. However, as the complexity of both applications and hardware increases, GPU chip manufacturers face a significant challenge: how to gather comprehensive performance characteristics and value profiles from GPUs deployed in real-world scenarios. Such data, encompassing the types of kernels executed and the time spent in each, is crucial for optimizing chip design and enhancing application performance. Unfortunately, despite the availability of low-level tools like NSYS and NCU, current methodologies fall short, offering data collection capabilities only on an individual user basis rather than a broader, more informative fleet-wide scale. This paper takes on the problem of realizing a system that allows planet-scale real-time GPU performance profiling of low-level hardware characteristics. The three fundamental problems we solve are: i) user experience of achieving this with no slowdown; ii) preserving user privacy, so that no 3rd party is aware of what applications any user runs; iii) efficacy in showing we are able to collect data and assign it applications even when run on 1000s of GPUs. Our results simulate a 100,000 size GPU deployment, running applications from the Torchbench suite, showing our system addresses all 3 problems."
2509.2241,"The evaluation of new microprocessor designs is constrained by slow, cycle-accurate simulators that rely on unrepresentative benchmark traces. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for high-fidelity, ``in-the-wild'' simulation on production hardware. Our core contribution is a DL model trained on microarchitecture-independent features to predict cycle-level performance for hypothetical processor designs. This unique approach allows the model to be deployed on existing silicon to evaluate future hardware. We propose a complete system featuring a lightweight hardware trace collector and a principled sampling strategy to minimize user impact. This system achieves a simulation speed of 5 MIPS on a commodity GPU, imposing a mere 0.1% performance overhead. Furthermore, our co-designed Neutrino on-chip accelerator improves performance by 85x over the GPU. We demonstrate that this framework enables accurate performance analysis and large-scale hardware A/B testing on a massive scale using real-world applications."
2509.22512,"Large language models demand massive computational power and memory resources, posing significant challenges for efficient deployment. While quantization has been widely explored to reduce model size and computation, this paper demonstrates an additional benefit: quantization increases parameter locality, creating opportunities for computation reuse. Building on this insight, we propose AxLLM, a hardware accelerator architecture designed for quantized models. Axllm introduces a novel redundancy elimination technique that caches and reuses multiplication results for repeated weight values, substantially reducing redundant operations. The architecture features dual multiply and reuse pipelines, efficiently supporting both base models and LoRA fine-tuned models without altering parameters, retraining, or requiring offline preprocessing. Experimental results show that AxLLM achieves up to 90% reduction in computations, delivering 28% lower energy consumption and a 1.7x speedup over baseline execution. These results highlight Axllm as a scalable and efficient solution for accelerating LLMs on specialized hardware."
2509.2298,"Processing-in-Memory (PIM) is a promising approach to overcoming the memory-wall bottleneck. However, the PIM community has largely treated its two fundamental data layouts, Bit-Parallel (BP) and Bit-Serial (BS), as if they were interchangeable. This implicit ""one-layout-fits-all"" assumption, often hard-coded into existing evaluation frameworks, creates a critical gap: architects lack systematic, workload-driven guidelines for choosing the optimal data layout for their target applications. To address this gap, this paper presents the first systematic, workload-driven characterization of BP and BS PIM architectures. We develop iso-area, cycle-accurate BP and BS PIM architectural models and conduct a comprehensive evaluation using a diverse set of benchmarks. Our suite includes both fine-grained microworkloads from MIMDRAM to isolate specific operational characteristics, and large-scale applications from the PIMBench suite, such as the VGG network, to represent realistic end-to-end workloads. Our results quantitatively demonstrate that no single layout is universally superior; the optimal choice is strongly dependent on workload characteristics. BP excels on control-flow-intensive tasks with irregular memory access patterns, whereas BS shows substantial advantages in massively parallel, low-precision (e.g., INT4/INT8) computations common in AI. Based on this characterization, we distill a set of actionable design guidelines for architects. This work challenges the prevailing one-size-fits-all view on PIM data layouts and provides a principled foundation for designing next-generation, workload-aware, and potentially hybrid PIM systems."
2509.22999,"This paper presents an accuracy-enhanced Hybrid Temporal Computing (E-HTC) framework for ultra-low-power hardware accelerators with deterministic additions. Inspired by the recently proposed HTC architecture, which leverages pulse-rate and temporal data encoding to reduce switching activity and energy consumption but loses accuracy due to its multiplexer (MUX)-based scaled addition, we propose two bitstream addition schemes: (1) an Exact Multiple-input Binary Accumulator (EMBA), which performs precise binary accumulation, and (2) a Deterministic Threshold-based Scaled Adder (DTSA), which employs threshold logic for scaled addition. These adders are integrated into a multiplier accumulator (MAC) unit supporting both unipolar and bipolar encodings. To validate the framework, we implement two accelerators: a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter and an 8-point Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)/iDCT engine. Results on a 4x4 MAC show that, in unipolar mode, E-HTC matches the RMSE of state-of-the-art Counter-Based Stochastic Computing (CBSC) MAC, improves accuracy by 94% over MUX-based HTC, and reduces power and area by 23% and 7% compared to MUX-based HTC and 64% and 74% compared to CBSC. In bipolar mode, E-HTC MAC achieves 2.09% RMSE -- an 83% improvement over MUX-based HTC -- and approaches CBSC's 1.40% RMSE with area and power savings of 28% and 43% vs. MUX-based HTC and about 76% vs. CBSC. In FIR experiments, both E-HTC variants yield PSNR gains of 3--5 dB (30--45% RMSE reduction) while saving 13% power and 3% area. For DCT/iDCT, E-HTC boosts PSNR by 10--13 dB (70--75% RMSE reduction) while saving area and power over both MUX- and CBSC-based designs."
2509.23179,"Recent advancements in post-quantum cryptographic algorithms have led to their standardization by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to safeguard information security in the post-quantum era. These algorithms, however, employ public keys and signatures that are 3 to 9$\times$ longer than those used in pre-quantum cryptography, resulting in significant performance and energy efficiency overheads. A critical bottleneck identified in our analysis is the cache bandwidth. This limitation motivates the adoption of on-chip in-/near-cache computing, a computing paradigm that offers high-performance, exceptional energy efficiency, and flexibility to accelerate post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. Our analysis of existing works reveals challenges in integrating in-/near-cache computing into modern computer systems and performance limitations due to external bandwidth limitation, highlighting the need for innovative solutions that can seamlessly integrate into existing systems without performance and energy efficiency issues. In this paper, we introduce a near-cache-slice computing paradigm with support of customization and virtual address, named Crypto-Near-Cache (CNC), designed to accelerate post-quantum cryptographic algorithms and other applications. By placing SRAM arrays with bitline computing capability near cache slices, high internal bandwidth and short data movement are achieved with native support of virtual addressing. An ISA extension to facilitate CNC is also proposed, with detailed discussion on the implementation aspects of the core/cache datapath."
2509.23674,"Assertion-based verification (ABV) serves as a crucial technique for ensuring that register-transfer level (RTL) designs adhere to their specifications. While Large Language Model (LLM) aided assertion generation approaches have recently achieved remarkable progress, existing methods are still unable to effectively identify the relationship between design specifications and RTL designs, which leads to the insufficiency of the generated assertions. To address this issue, we propose AssertGen, an assertion generation framework that automatically generates SystemVerilog assertions (SVA). AssertGen first extracts verification objectives from specifications using a chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning strategy, then bridges corresponding signals between these objectives and the RTL code to construct a cross-layer signal chain, and finally generates SVAs based on the LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that AssertGen outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods across several key metrics, such as pass rate of formal property verification (FPV), cone of influence (COI), proof core and mutation testing coverage."
2509.23693,"Lossless compression imposes significant computational over head on datacenters when performed on CPUs. Hardware compression and decompression processing units (CDPUs) can alleviate this overhead, but optimal algorithm selection, microarchitectural design, and system-level placement of CDPUs are still not well understood. We present the design of an ASIC-based in-storage CDPU and provide a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation against two leading ASIC accelerators, Intel QAT 8970 and QAT 4xxx. The evaluation spans three dominant CDPU placement regimes: peripheral, on-chip, and in-storage. Our results reveal: (i) acute sensitivity of throughput and latency to CDPU placement and interconnection, (ii) strong correlation between compression efficiency and data patterns/layouts, (iii) placement-driven divergences between microbenchmark gains and real-application speedups, (iv) discrepancies between module and system-level power efficiency, and (v) scalability and multi-tenant interference is sues of various CDPUs. These findings motivate a placement-aware, cross-layer rethinking of hardware (de)compression for hyperscale storage infrastructures."
2509.23972,"Assertion-based verification (ABV) is critical in ensuring that register-transfer level (RTL) designs conform to their functional specifications. SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) effectively specify design properties, but writing and maintaining them manually is challenging and error-prone. Although recent progress of assertion generation methods leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in improving assertion quality, they typically treat assertion generation as a final step, leaving the burden of fixing of the incorrect assertions to human effects, which may significantly limits the application of these methods. To address the above limitation, we propose an automatic assertion fix framework based on LLMs, named AssertFix. AsserFix accurately locates the RTL code related to the incorrect assertion, systematically identifies the root causes of the assertion errors, classifies the error type and finally applies dedicated fix strategies to automatically correct these errors, improving the overall quality of the generated assertions. Experimental results show that AssertFix achieves noticeable improvements in both fix rate and verification coverage across the Opencore benchmarks."
2509.24929,"Fault injection attacks exploit physical disturbances to compromise the functionality and security of integrated circuits. As System on Chip (SoC) architectures grow in complexity, the vulnerability of on chip communication fabrics has become increasingly prominent. Buses, serving as interconnects among various IP cores, represent potential vectors for fault-based exploitation. In this study, we perform simulation-driven fault injection across three mainstream bus protocols Wishbone, AXI Lite, and AXI. We systematically examine fault success rates, spatial vulnerability distributions, and timing dependencies to characterize how faults interact with bus-level transactions. The results uncover consistent behavioral patterns across protocols, offering practical insights for both attack modeling and the development of resilient SoC designs."
2509.25391,"Since current neural network development systems in Xilinx and VLSI require codevelopment with Python libraries, the first stage of a convolutional network has been implemented by developing a convolutional layer entirely in Verilog. This handcoded design, free of IP cores and based on a filter polynomial like structure, enables straightforward deployment not only on low cost FPGAs but also on SoMs, SoCs, and ASICs. We analyze the limitations of numerical representations and compare our implemented architecture, smallNet, with its computer based counterpart, demonstrating a 5.1x speedup, over 81% classification accuracy, and a total power consumption of just 1.5 W. The algorithm is validated on a single-core Cora Z7, demonstrating its feasibility for real time, resource-constrained embedded applications."
2509.25626,"3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a transformative technique with profound implications on novel view synthesis and real-time rendering. Given its importance, there have been many attempts to improve its performance. However, with the increasing complexity of GPU architectures and the vast search space of performance-tuning parameters, it is a challenging task. Although manual optimizations have achieved remarkable speedups, they require domain expertise and the optimization process can be highly time consuming and error prone. In this paper, we propose to exploit large language models (LLMs) to analyze and optimize Gaussian splatting kernels. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use LLMs to optimize highly specialized real-world GPU kernels. We reveal the intricacies of using LLMs for code optimization and analyze the code optimization techniques from the LLMs. We also propose ways to collaborate with LLMs to further leverage their capabilities. For the original 3DGS code on the MipNeRF360 datasets, LLMs achieve significant speedups, 19% with Deepseek and 24% with GPT-5, demonstrating the different capabilities of different LLMs. By feeding additional information from performance profilers, the performance improvement from LLM-optimized code is enhanced to up to 42% and 38% on average. In comparison, our best-effort manually optimized version can achieve a performance improvement up to 48% and 39% on average, showing that there are still optimizations beyond the capabilities of current LLMs. On the other hand, even upon a newly proposed 3DGS framework with algorithmic optimizations, Seele, LLMs can still further enhance its performance by 6%, showing that there are optimization opportunities missed by domain experts. This highlights the potential of collaboration between domain experts and LLMs."
2509.25853,"Large Language Model (LLM) inference requires substantial computational resources, yet CPU-based inference remains essential for democratizing AI due to the widespread availability of CPUs compared to specialized accelerators. However, efficient LLM inference on CPUs faces two fundamental challenges: (1) existing CPU architectures struggle with low-precision arithmetic required by quantized models, where optimal bit precision varies across models and layers; and (2) the memory-bound nature of the token generation phase creates severe performance bottlenecks. To address these challenges, we propose SAIL (SRAM-Accelerated Inference of LLMs), a CPU-based inference solution that efficiently supports arbitrary bit precisions with minimal overhead. SAIL integrates three key innovations: First, we introduce Batched LUT-based General Matrix-Vector Multiplication (LUT-GEMV) with SRAM-based processing-in-memory, enabling high data reuse through lookup tables and reducing memory movement. Second, our Pattern-Aware LUT optimization identifies and exploits redundancy in input activation patterns, reducing computation cycles by 13.8\%. Third, we develop an in-memory type conversion algorithm that leverages PIM's parallelism for efficient de-/quantization operations, alleviating pressure on CPU's vector units. Our architecture requires only 2\% hardware overhead and a single new instruction, while maintaining dual functionality as both compute and storage units. Experimental evaluations using a modified gem5 simulator demonstrate that SAIL achieves up to 10.7x speedup and 19.9x higher tokens per dollar compared to ARM Neoverse-N1 CPU baselines, and up to 7.04x better cost efficiency than NVIDIA V100 GPUs, establishing a practical path for efficient CPU-based LLM inference."
2509.26065,"Energy efficiency is one of the major concern in designing advanced computing infrastructures. From single nodes to large-scale systems (data centers), monitoring the energy consumption of the computing system when applications run is a critical task. Designers and application developers often rely on software tools and detailed architectural models to extract meaningful information and determine the system energy consumption. However, when a design space exploration is required, designers may incur in continuous tuning of the models to match with the system under evaluation. To overcome such limitations, we propose a holistic approach to monitor energy consumption at runtime without the need of running complex (micro-)architectural models. Our approach is based on a measurement board coupled with a FPGA-based System-on-Module. The measuring board captures currents and voltages (up to tens measuring points) driving the FPGA and exposes such values through a specific memory region. A running service reads and computes energy consumption statistics without consuming extra resources on the FPGA device. Our approach is also scalable to monitoring of multi-nodes infrastructures (clusters). We aim to leverage this framework to perform experiments in the context of an aeronautical design application; specifically, we will look at optimizing performance and energy consumption of a shallow artificial neural network on RISC-V based soft-cores."
2510.00333,"Transprecision computing (TC) is a promising approach for energy-efficient machine learning (ML) computation on resource-constrained platforms. This work presents a novel ASIC design of a Transprecision Arithmetic and Logic Unit (TALU) that can support multiple number formats: Posit, Floating Point (FP), and Integer (INT) data with variable bitwidth of 8, 16, and 32 bits. Additionally, TALU can be reconfigured in runtime to support TC without overprovisioning the hardware. Posit is a new number format, gaining traction for ML computations, producing similar accuracy in lower bitwidth than FP representation. This paper thus proposes a novel algorithm for decoding Posit for energy-efficient computation. TALU implementation achieves a 54.6x reduction in power consumption and 19.8x reduction in the area as compared to a state-of-the-art unified MAC unit (UMAC for Posit and FP computation. Experimental results on an ML compute kernel executed on a Vector Processor of TALUs integrated with a RISC-V processor achieves about 2x improvement in energy efficiency and similar throughput as compared to a state-of-the-art TC-based vector processor."
2510.0173,"Advancements in AI have greatly enhanced the medical imaging process, making it quicker to diagnose patients. However, very few have investigated the optimization of a multi-model system with hardware acceleration. As specialized edge devices emerge, the efficient use of their accelerators is becoming increasingly crucial. This paper proposes a hardware-accelerated method for simultaneous reconstruction and diagnosis of \ac{MRI} from \ac{CT} images. Real-time performance of achieving a throughput of nearly 150 frames per second was achieved by leveraging hardware engines available in modern NVIDIA edge GPU, along with scheduling techniques. This includes the GPU and the \ac{DLA} available in both Jetson AGX Xavier and Jetson AGX Orin, which were considered in this paper. The hardware allocation of different layers of the multiple AI models was done in such a way that the ideal time between the hardware engines is reduced. In addition, the AI models corresponding to the \ac{GAN} model were fine-tuned in such a way that no fallback execution into the GPU engine is required without compromising accuracy. Indeed, the accuracy corresponding to the fine-tuned edge GPU-aware AI models exhibited an accuracy enhancement of 5\%. A further hardware allocation of two fine-tuned GPU-aware GAN models proves they can double the performance over the original model, leveraging adequate partitioning on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and Orin devices. The results prove the effectiveness of employing hardware-aware models in parallel for medical image analysis and diagnosis."
2510.02099,"Vector-Matrix Multiplication (VMM) is the fundamental and frequently required computation in inference of Neural Networks (NN). Due to the large data movement required during inference, VMM can benefit greatly from in-memory computing. However, ADC/DACs required for in-memory VMM consume significant power and area. `Distributed Arithmetic (DA)', a technique in computer architecture prevalent in 1980s was used to achieve inner product or dot product of two vectors without using a hard-wired multiplier when one of the vectors is a constant. In this work, we extend the DA technique to multiply an input vector with a constant matrix. By storing the sum of the weights in memory, DA achieves VMM using shift-and-add circuits in the periphery of ReRAM memory. We verify functional and also estimate non-functional properties (latency, energy, area) by performing transistor-level simulations. Using energy-efficient sensing and fine grained pipelining, our approach achieves 4.5 x less latency and 12 x less energy than VMM performed in memory conventionally by bit slicing. Furthermore, DA completely eliminated the need for power-hungry ADCs which are the main source of area and energy consumption in the current VMM implementations in memory."
2510.02675,"The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven a growing demand for efficient inference, particularly in latency-sensitive applications such as chatbots and personalized assistants. Unlike traditional deep neural networks, LLM inference proceeds in two distinct phases: the prefill phase, which processes the full input sequence in parallel, and the decode phase, which generates tokens sequentially. These phases exhibit highly diverse compute and memory requirements, which makes accelerator design particularly challenging. Prior works have primarily been optimized for high-batch inference or evaluated only short input context lengths, leaving the low-batch and long context regime, which is critical for interactive applications, largely underexplored.We propose HALO, a heterogeneous memory centric accelerator designed for these unique challenges of prefill and decode phases in low-batch LLM inference. HALO integrates HBM based Compute-in-DRAM (CiD) with an on-chip analog Compute-in-Memory (CiM), co-packaged using 2.5D integration. To further improve the hardware utilization, we introduce a phase-aware mapping strategy that adapts to the distinct demands of the prefill and decode phases. Compute bound operations in the prefill phase are mapped to CiM to exploit its high throughput matrix multiplication capability, while memory-bound operations in the decode phase are executed on CiD to benefit from reduced data movement within DRAM. Additionally, we present an analysis of the performance tradeoffs of LLMs under two architectural extremes: a fully CiD and a fully on-chip analog CiM design to highlight the need for a heterogeneous design. We evaluate HALO on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen3 8B models. Our experimental results show that LLMs mapped to HALO achieve up to 18x geometric mean speedup over AttAcc, an attention-optimized mapping and 2.5x over CENT, a fully CiD based mapping."
2510.02863,"The combinatorial problem Max-Cut has become a benchmark in the evaluation of local search heuristics for both quantum and classical optimisers. In contrast to local search, which only provides average-case performance guarantees, the convex semidefinite relaxation of Max-Cut by Goemans and Williamson, provides worst-case guarantees and is therefore suited to both the construction of benchmarks and in applications to performance-critic scenarios.We show how extended floating point precision can be incorporated in algebraic subroutines in convex optimisation, namely in indirect matrix inversion methods like Conjugate Gradient, which are used in Interior Point Methods in the case of very large problem sizes. Also, an estimate is provided of the expected acceleration of the time to solution for a hardware architecture that runs natively on extended precision. Specifically, when using indirect matrix inversion methods like Conjugate Gradient, which have lower complexity than direct methods and are therefore used in very large problems, we see that increasing the internal working precision reduces the time to solution by a factor that increases with the system size."
2510.0299,"The increasing demand for real-time, low-latency artificial intelligence applications has propelled the use of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementations. FPGAs offer reconfigurability, energy efficiency, and performance advantages over GPUs, making them suitable for edge devices and embedded systems. This work presents a novel library of resource-efficient convolution IPs designed to automatically adapt to the available FPGA resources. Developed in VHDL, these IPs are parameterizable and utilize fixed-point arithmetic for optimal performance. Four IPs are introduced, each tailored to specific resource constraints, offering flexibility in DSP usage, logic consumption, and precision. Experimental results on a Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA highlight the trade-offs between performance and resource usage. The comparison with recent FPGA-based CNN acceleration techniques emphasizes the versatility and independence of this approach from specific FPGA architectures or technological advancements. Future work will expand the library to include pooling and activation functions, enabling broader applicability and integration into CNN frameworks."
2510.04158,"Instruction density and encoding efficiency are some of the few things directly affected by an instruction set architecture's design. In contrast, a processor's implementation often significantly influences performance, power efficiency, and area usage. Therefore, a major goal of instruction set design should be maximizing instruction density and encoding efficiency. This paper introduces the design elements of the Scry instruction set architecture that most significantly affect instruction density and encoding efficiency. Scry is a novel and experimental instruction set that revisits first principles to design an instruction set fit for modern processor implementations. Scry uses forward-temporal referencing as a means of data flow, where instructions refer to which future instructions consume their outputs. It also uses internal tagging, where the processors track data types internally, to reduce the number of instructions needed and increase flexibility. Combining these two methods, Scry achieves instruction-feature parity with RISC-V's RV64IMC using only 2-byte instructions compared to RISC-V's 4 bytes. Scry's instructions occupy only 28% of the 2-byte encoding space, where RV64IMC instructions occupy 68% of the 4-byte encoding space. We show that hand-compiled Scry's static instruction density is comparable to RV64IMC for small functions and improves as functions grow in size."
2510.05245,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a prevailing design for achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks. MoE models use sparse gating to activate only a handful of expert sub-networks per input, achieving billion-parameter capacity with inference costs akin to much smaller models. However, such models often pose challenges for hardware deployment due to the massive data volume introduced by the MoE layers. To address the challenges of serving MoE models, we propose Stratum, a system-hardware co-design approach that combines the novel memory technology Monolithic 3D-Stackable DRAM (Mono3D DRAM), near-memory processing (NMP), and GPU acceleration. The logic and Mono3D DRAM dies are connected through hybrid bonding, whereas the Mono3D DRAM stack and GPU are interconnected via silicon interposer. Mono3D DRAM offers higher internal bandwidth than HBM thanks to the dense vertical interconnect pitch enabled by its monolithic structure, which supports implementations of higher-performance near-memory processing. Furthermore, we tackle the latency differences introduced by aggressive vertical scaling of Mono3D DRAM along the z-dimension by constructing internal memory tiers and assigning data across layers based on access likelihood, guided by topic-based expert usage prediction to boost NMP throughput. The Stratum system achieves up to 8.29x improvement in decoding throughput and 7.66x better energy efficiency across various benchmarks compared to GPU baselines."
2510.05327,"As large language models (LLMs) continue to be integrated into modern technology, there has been an increased push towards code generation applications, which also naturally extends to hardware design automation. LLM-based solutions for register transfer level (RTL) code generation for intellectual property (IP) designs have grown, especially with fine-tuned LLMs, prompt engineering, and agentic approaches becoming popular in literature. However, a gap has been exposed in these techniques, as they fail to integrate novel IPs into the model's knowledge base, subsequently resulting in poorly generated code. Additionally, as general-purpose LLMs continue to improve, fine-tuned methods on older models will not be able to compete to produce more accurate and efficient designs. Although some retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques exist to mitigate challenges presented in fine-tuning approaches, works tend to leverage low-quality codebases, incorporate computationally expensive fine-tuning in the frameworks, or do not use RAG directly in the RTL generation step. In this work, we introduce DeepV: a model-agnostic RAG framework to generate RTL designs by enhancing context through a large, high-quality dataset without any RTL-specific training. Our framework benefits the latest commercial LLM, OpenAI's GPT-5, with a near 17% increase in performance on the VerilogEval benchmark. We host DeepV for use by the community in a Hugging Face (HF) Space:this https URL."
2510.05632,"With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), the demand for high-performance LLM inference services continues to grow. To meet this demand, a growing number of AI accelerators have been proposed, such as Google TPU, Huawei NPU, Graphcore IPU, and Cerebras WSE, etc. Most of these accelerators adopt multi-core architectures to achieve enhanced scalability, but lack the flexibility of SIMT architectures. Therefore, without careful configuration of the hardware architecture, as well as deliberate design of tensor parallelism and core placement strategies, computational resources may be underutilized, resulting in suboptimal inference performance.To address these challenges, we first present a multi-level simulation framework with both transaction-level and performance-model-based simulation for multi-core NPUs. Using this simulator, we conduct a systematic analysis and further propose the optimal solutions for tensor parallelism strategies, core placement policies, memory management methods, as well as the selection between PD-disaggregation and PD-fusion on multi-core NPUs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on representative LLMs and various NPU configurations. The evaluation results demonstrate that, our solution can achieve 1.32x-6.03x speedup compared to SOTA designs for multi-core NPUs across different hardware configurations. As for LLM serving, our work offers guidance on designing optimal hardware architectures and serving strategies for multi-core NPUs across various LLM workloads."
2510.05787,"This work aims to improve a data center's efficiency by optimizing the server upgrade plan: determine the optimal timing for replacing old servers with new ones. The opportunity presented by this approach is demonstrated through a study based on historical server data. The study establishes a significant opportunity to increase the QPS/(TCOxCO2) metric by formulating a global upgrade plan at the data center's design time covering its entire life cycle. This plan leverages information, such as server entry year, performance, and active power consumption for both existing and future servers. Our findings reveal that an optimal global upgrade plan, may involve upgrades at non fixed time periods and outperforms local upgrade plans. Local upgrade plans follow a fixed, equal-length cycle and make decisions based only on currently available server models. These local plans select the best available server at each upgrade cycle without accounting for future server releases."
2510.06513,"Emerging computing applications such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) are facing a memory wall with existing on-package memory solutions that are unable to meet the power-efficient bandwidth demands. We propose to enhance UCIe with memory semantics to deliver power-efficient bandwidth and cost-effective on-package memory solutions applicable across the entire computing continuum. We propose approaches by reusing existing LPDDR6 and HBM memory through a logic die that connects to the SoC using UCIe. We also propose an approach where the DRAM die natively supports UCIe instead of the LPDDR6 bus interface. Our approaches result in significantly higher bandwidth density (up to 10x), lower latency (up to 3x), lower power (up to 3x), and lower cost compared to existing HBM4 and LPDDR on-package memory solutions."
2510.06644,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems can largely benefit from 3DGS's state-of-the-art rendering efficiency and accuracy, but have not yet been adopted in resource-constrained edge devices due to insufficient speed. Addressing this, we identify notable redundancies across the SLAM pipeline for acceleration. While conceptually straightforward, practical approaches are required to minimize the overhead associated with identifying and eliminating these redundancies. In response, we propose RTGS, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that comprehensively reduces the redundancies for real-time 3DGS-SLAM on edge. To minimize the overhead, RTGS fully leverages the characteristics of the 3DGS-SLAM pipeline. On the algorithm side, we introduce (1) an adaptive Gaussian pruning step to remove the redundant Gaussians by reusing gradients computed during backpropagation; and (2) a dynamic downsampling technique that directly reuses the keyframe identification and alpha computing steps to eliminate redundant pixels. On the hardware side, we propose (1) a subtile-level streaming strategy and a pixel-level pairwise scheduling strategy that mitigates workload imbalance via a Workload Scheduling Unit (WSU) guided by previous iteration information; (2) a Rendering and Backpropagation (R&B) Buffer that accelerates the rendering backpropagation by reusing intermediate data computed during rendering; and (3) a Gradient Merging Unit (GMU) to reduce intensive memory accesses caused by atomic operations while enabling pipelined aggregation. Integrated into an edge GPU, RTGS achieves real-time performance (>= 30 FPS) on four datasets and three algorithms, with up to 82.5x energy efficiency over the baseline and negligible quality loss.

2510.06767,"Single-precision floating point (FP32) data format, defined by the IEEE 754 standard, is widely employed in scientific computing, signal processing, and deep learning training, where precision is critical. However, FP32 multiplication is computationally expensive and requires complex hardware, especially for precisely handling mantissa multiplication. In practical applications like neural network inference, perfect accuracy is not always necessary, minor multiplication errors often have little impact on final accuracy. This enables trading precision for gains in area, power, and speed. This work focuses on CNN inference using approximate FP32 multipliers, where the mantissa multiplication is approximated by employing error-variant approximate compressors, that significantly reduce hardware cost. Furthermore, this work optimizes CNN performance by employing differently approximated FP32 multipliers and studying their impact when interleaved within the kernels across the convolutional layers. The placement and ordering of these approximate multipliers within each kernel are carefully optimized using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II, balancing the trade-off between accuracy and hardware efficiency."
2510.07304,"Machine learning (ML) models memorize and leak training data, causing serious privacy issues to data owners. Training algorithms with differential privacy (DP), such as DP-SGD, have been gaining attention as a solution. However, DP-SGD adds a noise at each training iteration, which degrades the accuracy of the trained model. To improve accuracy, a new family of approaches adds carefully designed correlated noises, so that noises cancel out each other across iterations. We performed an extensive characterization study of these new mechanisms, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, and show they incur non-negligible overheads when the model is large or uses large embedding tables. Motivated by the analysis, we propose Cocoon, a hardware-software co-designed framework for efficient training with correlated noises. Cocoon accelerates models with embedding tables through pre-computing and storing correlated noises in a coalesced format (Cocoon-Emb), and supports large models through a custom near-memory processing device (Cocoon-NMP). On a real system with an FPGA-based NMP device prototype, Cocoon improves the performance by 2.33-10.82x(Cocoon-Emb) and 1.55-3.06x (Cocoon-NMP)."
2510.07449,"This work introduces a model-based framework that reveals the idle opportunity of modern servers running latency-critical applications. Specifically, three queuing models, M/M/1, cxM/M/1, and M/M/c, are used to estimate the theoretical idle time distribution at the CPU core and system (package) level. A comparison of the actual idleness of a real server and that from the theoretical models reveals significant missed opportunities to enter deep idle states. This inefficiency is attributed to the idle-governor inaccuracy and the high latency to transition to/from legacy deep-idle states. The proposed methodology offers the means for an early-stage design exploration and insights into idle time behavior and opportunities for varying server system configurations and load."
2510.07719,"PIM architectures aim to reduce data transfer costs between processors and memory by integrating processing units within memory layers. Prior PIM architectures have shown potential to improve energy efficiency and performance. However, such advantages rely on data proximity to the processing units performing computations. Data movement overheads can degrade PIM's performance and energy efficiency due to the need to move data between a processing unit and a distant memory location. %they face challenges due to the overhead of transferring data from remote memory locations to processing units inside memory for computation. In this paper, we demonstrate that a large fraction of PIM's latency per memory request is attributed to data transfers and queuing delays from remote memory accesses. To improve PIM's data locality, we propose DL-PIM, a novel architecture that dynamically detects the overhead of data movement, and proactively moves data to a reserved area in the local memory of the requesting processing unit. DL-PIM uses a distributed address-indirection hardware lookup table to redirect traffic to the current data location. We propose DL-PIM implementations on two 3D stacked memories: HMC and HBM. While some workloads benefit from DL-PIM, others are negatively impacted by the additional latency due to indirection accesses. Therefore, we propose an adaptive mechanism that assesses the cost and benefit of indirection and dynamically enables or disables it to prevent degrading workloads that suffer from indirection. Overall, DL-PIM reduces the average memory latency per request by 54% in HMC and 50% in HBM which resulted in performance improvement of 15% for workloads with substantial data reuse in HMC and 5% in HBM. For all representative workloads, DL-PIM achieved a 6% speedup in HMC and a 3% speedup in HBM, showing that DL-PIM enhances data locality and overall system performance."

2510.08351,"Fast and scalable metadata management across multiple metadata servers is crucial for distributed file systems to handle numerous files and directories. Client-side caching of frequently accessed metadata can mitigate server loads, but incurs significant overhead and complexity in maintaining cache consistency when the number of clients increases. We propose FMCache, an in-switch file-system metadata caching framework that leverages programmable switches to serve file-system metadata requests from multiple clients directly in the switch data plane. Unlike prior in-switch key-value caching approaches, FMCache addresses file-system-specific path dependencies under stringent switch resource constraints. We implement FMCache atop Hadoop HDFS and evaluate it on a Tofino-switch testbed using real-world file-system metadata workloads. FMCache achieves up to 181.6% higher throughput than vanilla HDFS and complements client-side caching with additional throughput gains of up to 139.6%. It also incurs low latencies and limited switch resource usage."
2510.08544,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in recent years, driving up the demand for inference. LLM inference is composed of two phases with distinct characteristics: a compute-bound prefill phase followed by a memory-bound decode phase. To efficiently serve LLMs, prior work proposes prefill-decode disaggregation to run each phase on separate hardware. However, existing hardware poorly matches the different requirements of each phase. Current datacenter GPUs and TPUs follow a more-is-better design philosophy that maximizes compute and memory resources, causing memory bandwidth underutilization in the prefill phase and compute underutilization in the decode phase. Such underutilization directly translates into increased serving costs.This paper proposes SPAD (Specialized Prefill and Decode hardware), adopting a less-is-more methodology to design specialized chips tailored to the distinct characteristics of prefill and decode phases. The proposed Prefill Chips have larger systolic arrays and use cost-effective GDDR memory, whereas the proposed Decode Chips retain high memory bandwidth but reduce compute capacity. Compared to modeled H100s, simulations show that the proposed Prefill Chips deliver 8% higher prefill performance on average at 52% lower hardware cost, while the proposed Decode Chips achieve 97% of the decode performance with 28% lower TDP.End-to-end simulations on production traces show that SPAD reduces hardware cost by 19%-41% and TDP by 2%-17% compared to modeled baseline clusters while offering the same performance. Even when models and workloads change, SPAD can reallocate either type of chip to run either phase and still achieve 11%-43% lower hardware costs, demonstrating the longevity of the SPAD design."
2510.08873,"Modern AI acceleration faces a fundamental challenge: conventional assumptions about memory requirements, batching effectiveness, and latency-throughput tradeoffs are systemwide generalizations that ignore the heterogeneous computational patterns of individual neural network operators. However, going towards network-level customization and operator-level heterogeneity incur substantial Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs. While chiplet-based approaches have been proposed to amortize NRE costs, reuse opportunities remain limited without carefully identifying which chiplets are truly necessary. This paper introduces Mozart, a chiplet ecosystem and accelerator codesign framework that systematically constructs low cost bespoke application-specific integrated circuits (BASICs). BASICs leverage operator-level disaggregation to explore chiplet and memory heterogeneity, tensor fusion, and tensor parallelism, with place-and-route validation ensuring physical implementability. The framework also enables constraint-aware system-level optimization across deployment contexts ranging from datacenter inference serving to edge computing in autonomous vehicles. The evaluation confirms that with just 8 strategically selected chiplets, Mozart-generated composite BASICs achieve 43.5%, 25.4%, 67.7%, and 78.8% reductions in energy, energy-cost product, energy-delay product (EDP), and energy-delay-cost product compared to traditional homogeneous accelerators. For datacenter LLM serving, Mozart achieves 15-19% energy reduction and 35-39% energy-cost improvement. In speculative decoding, Mozart delivers throughput improvements of 24.6-58.6% while reducing energy consumption by 38.6-45.6%. For autonomous vehicle perception, Mozart reduces energy-cost by 25.54% and energy by 10.53% under real-time constraints."
2510.0894,"Hand-sized Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing machines are of growing importance in several life sciences fields as their small footprints enable a broader range of use cases than their larger, stationary counterparts. However, as currently designed, they lack sufficient embedded computing to process the large volume of measurements generated by their internal sensory system. As a consequence, they rely on external devices for additional processing capability. This dependence on external processing places a significant communication burden on the sequencer's embedded electronics. Moreover, it also prevents a truly mobile solution for sequencing in real-time. Anticipating next-generation machines that include suitably advanced processing, we present a System-on-Chip (SoC) fabricated in 22-nm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS).

2510.0901,"Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction method, delivering high-quality results for AR/VR applications. While quantization methods and hardware accelerators have been proposed to enhance NeRF's computational efficiency, existing approaches face crucial limitations. Current quantization methods operate without considering hardware architecture, resulting in sub-optimal solutions within the vast design space encompassing accuracy, latency, and model size. Additionally, existing NeRF accelerators heavily rely on human experts to explore this design space, making the optimization process time-consuming, inefficient, and unlikely to discover optimal solutions. To address these challenges, we introduce HERO, a reinforcement learning framework performing hardware-aware quantization for NeRF. Our framework integrates a NeRF accelerator simulator to generate real-time hardware feedback, enabling fully automated adaptation to hardware constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that HERO achieves 1.31-1.33 $\times$ better latency, 1.29-1.33 $\times$ improved cost efficiency, and a more compact model size compared to CAQ, a previous state-of-the-art NeRF quantization framework.

2510.10225,"Functional verification is a critical bottleneck in integrated circuit development, with CPU verification being especially time-intensive and labour-consuming. Industrial practice relies on differential testing for CPU verification, yet faces bottlenecks at nearly each stage of the framework pipeline: front-end stimulus generation lacks micro-architectural awareness, yielding low-quality and redundant tests that impede coverage closure and miss corner cases. Meanwhile, back-end simulation infrastructure, even with FPGA acceleration, often stalls on long-running tests and offers limited visibility, delaying feedback and prolonging the debugging cycle. Here, we present ISAAC, a full-stack, Large Language Model (LLM)-aided CPU verification framework with FPGA parallelism, from bug categorisation and stimulus generation to simulation infrastructure. To do so, we presented a multi-agent stimulus engine in ISAAC's front-end, infused with micro-architectural knowledge and historical bug patterns, generating highly targeted tests that rapidly achieve coverage goals and capture elusive corner cases. In ISAAC's back-end, we introduce a lightweight forward-snapshot mechanism and a decoupled co-simulation architecture between the Instruction Set Simulator (ISS) and the Design Under Test (DUT), enabling a single ISS to drive multiple DUTs in parallel. By eliminating long-tail test bottlenecks and exploiting FPGA parallelism, the simulation throughput is significantly improved. As a demonstration, we used ISAAC to verify a mature CPU that has undergone multiple successful tape-outs. Results show up to 17,536x speed-up over software RTL simulation, while detecting several previously unknown bugs, two of which are reported in this paper."

Quantization plays a vital role in reducing memory usage, and can be exploited for computations by designing reconfigurable architectures that enhance matrix multiplication by dynamically adjusting the precision. This paper proposes ADiP, a novel adaptive-precision systolic array architecture designed for efficient matrix multiplicationthis http URLproposed architecture consists of NxN adaptive-precision processing elements (PEs) and shared accumulators. ADiP supports multiple computation modes, including symmetric single-matrix multiplication as well as asymmetric multi-matrix multiplication with a shared input matrix, thereby improving data-reuse and PE utilization. In addition, ADiP maximizes the computational density by adapting to different precisions, such as 8bitx8bit, 8bitx4bit, and 8bitx2bit.

2510.10872,"The rapid expansion of mass spectrometry (MS) data, now exceeding hundreds of terabytes, poses significant challenges for efficient, large-scale library search - a critical component for drug discovery. Traditional processors struggle to handle this data volume efficiently, making in-storage computing (ISP) a promising alternative. This work introduces an ISP architecture leveraging a 3D Ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) structure, providing significantly higher density, faster speeds, and lower voltage requirements compared to traditional NAND flash. Despite its superior density, the NAND structure has not been widely utilized in ISP applications due to limited throughput associated with row-by-row reads from serially connected cells. To overcome these limitations, we integrate hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a brain-inspired paradigm that enables highly parallel processing with simple operations and strong error tolerance. By combining HDC with the proposed dual-bound approximate matching (D-BAM) distance metric, tailored to the FeNAND structure, we parallelize vector computations to enable efficient MS spectral library search, achieving 43x speedup and 21x higher energy efficiency over state-of-the-art 3D NAND methods, while maintaining comparable accuracy."
2510.11192,"Structured sparsity enables deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained systems. Approaches like dense-to-sparse fine-tuning are particularly compelling, achieving remarkable structured sparsity by reducing the model size by over 6.7x, while still maintaining acceptable accuracy. Despite this reduction, LLM inference, especially the decode stage being inherently memory-bound, is extremely expensive on conventional Von-Neumann architectures. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures mitigate this by performing computations directly in memory, and when paired with sparse LLMs, enable storing and computing the entire model in memory, eliminating the data movement on the off-chip bus and improving efficiency. Nonetheless, naively mapping sparse matrices onto CIM arrays leads to poor array utilization and diminished computational efficiency. In this paper, we present an automated framework with novel mapping and scheduling strategies to accelerate sparse LLM inference on CIM accelerators. By exploiting block-diagonal sparsity, our approach improves CIM array utilization by over 50%, achieving more than 4x reduction in both memory footprint and the number of required floating-point operations."
2510.12277,"With the ever-growing heterogeneity in computing systems, driven by modern machine learning applications, pressure is increasing on memory systems to handle arbitrary and more demanding transfers efficiently. Descriptor-based direct memory access controllers (DMACs) allow such transfers to be executed by decoupling memory transfers from processing units. Classical descriptor-based DMACs are inefficient when handling arbitrary transfers of small unit sizes. Excessive descriptor size and the serialized nature of processing descriptors employed by the DMAC lead to large static overheads when setting up transfers. To tackle this inefficiency, we propose a descriptor-based DMAC optimized to efficiently handle arbitrary transfers of small unit sizes. We implement a lightweight descriptor format in an AXI4-based DMAC. We further increase performance by implementing a low-overhead speculative descriptor prefetching scheme without additional latency penalties in the case of a misprediction. Our DMAC is integrated into a 64-bit Linux-capable RISC-V SoC and emulated on a Kintex FPGA to evaluate its performance. Compared to an off-the-shelf descriptor-based DMAC IP, we achieve 1.66x less latency launching transfers, increase bus utilization up to 2.5x in an ideal memory system with 64-byte-length transfers while requiring 11% fewer lookup tables, 23% fewer flip-flops, and no block RAMs. We can extend our lead in bus utilization to 3.6x with 64-byte-length transfers in deep memory systems. We synthesized our DMAC in GlobalFoundries' GF12LP+ node, achieving a clock frequency of over 1.44 GHz while occupying only 49.5 kGE."
2510.13147,"The computation and memory costs of large language models kept increasing over last decade, which reached over the scale of 1T parameters. To address the challenges from the large scale models, model compression techniques such as low-rank decomposition have been explored. Previous model decomposition works have focused on weight decomposition to avoid costly runtime decomposition, whose latency often significantly exceeds the benefits from decomposition (e.g., 38% more end-to-end latency when running Llama2-7b on A100 with 4K sequence length with activation decomposition compared to no decomposition). In this work, we debunk such observations and report that the input decomposition can be significantly beneficial with a proper choice of decomposition algorithm and hardware support. We adopt progressive decomposition algorithm, Lanczos algorithm, and design a co-accelerator architecture for the decomposition algorithm. To address the memory- boundness of the decomposition operation, we introduce a novel compute replication methodology that moves the op- eration toward compute-bound region, which enables 6.2x speedup in our evaluation. We also develop an output shape- preserving computation scheme that eliminates decomposi- tion costs in consecutive layers. To compensate model quality loss from compression, we introduce a multi-track decom- position approach that separately handles outlier channels for high accuracy and low perplexity with minimal compu- tational costs. Combined together, our accelerator, D-com, provides 22% end-to-end latency improvements compared to A100 GPU at the cost of small model quality degradation (e.g., 3% on AI2 Reasoning Challenge task)."

Quantization is fundamental to enable LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, andthis http URLutilizes block floating point (BFP) quantization to drastically reduce the bit width of weights and input tensors, the memory footprint, and the computational power required to run LLMs. LLMs are typically quantized with mixed BFP quantization across the model layers to reduce the loss of model accuracy due to quantization. Therefore, to efficiently accelerate across the layers of BFP-quantized LLMs, specialized accelerators need to support different BFP variants without reconfiguration. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible Block FloatingPoint Quantization (F-BFQ) accelerator, which can dynamically switch between two BFP quantization variants and perform matrix multiplication (MatMul) operations. Our initial F-BFQ accelerator design, deployed on the AMD Kria board, reduces inference time by 1.4x on average over the Arm NEON-based CPU execution across three BFP quantized LLMs while achieving 5.2 tokens per second (~3.9 words per second)."
2510.14172,"Hamiltonian simulation is a key workload in quantum computing, enabling the study of complex quantum systems and serving as a critical tool for classical verification of quantum devices. However, it is computationally challenging because the Hilbert space dimension grows exponentially with the number of qubits. The growing dimensions make matrix exponentiation, the key kernel in Hamiltonian simulations, increasingly expensive. Matrix exponentiation is typically approximated by the Taylor series, which contains a series of matrix multiplications. Since Hermitian operators are often sparse, sparse matrix multiplication accelerators are essential for improving the scalability of classical Hamiltonian simulation. Yet, existing accelerators are primarily designed for machine learning workloads and tuned to their characteristic sparsity patterns, which differ fundamentally from those in Hamiltonian simulations that are often dominated by structured diagonals.In this work, we present \name, the first diagonal-optimized quantum simulation accelerator. It exploits the diagonal structure commonly found in problem-Hamiltonian (Hermitian) matrices and leverages a restructured systolic array dataflow to transform diagonally sparse matrices into dense computations, enabling high utilization and performance.

2510.1475,"We experimentally demonstrate a new widespread read disturbance phenomenon, ColumnDisturb, in real commodity DRAM chips. By repeatedly opening or keeping a DRAM row (aggressor row) open, we show that it is possible to disturb DRAM cells through a DRAM column (i.e., bitline) and induce bitflips in DRAM cells sharing the same columns as the aggressor row (across multiple DRAM subarrays). With ColumnDisturb, the activation of a single row concurrently disturbs cells across as many as three subarrays (e.g., 3072 rows) as opposed to RowHammer/RowPress, which affect only a few neighboring rows of the aggressor row in a single subarray. We rigorously characterize ColumnDisturb and its characteristics under various operational conditions using 216 DDR4 and 4 HBM2 chips from three major manufacturers. Among our 27 key experimental observations, we highlight two major results and their implications.First, ColumnDisturb affects chips from all three major manufacturers and worsens as DRAM technology scales down to smaller node sizes (e.g., the minimum time to induce the first ColumnDisturb bitflip reduces by up to 5.06x). We observe that, in existing DRAM chips, ColumnDisturb induces bitflips within a standard DDR4 refresh window (e.g., in 63.6 ms) in multiple cells. We predict that, as DRAM technology node size reduces, ColumnDisturb would worsen in future DRAM chips, likely causing many more bitflips in the standard refresh window. Second, ColumnDisturb induces bitflips in many (up to 198x) more rows than retention failures. Therefore, ColumnDisturb has strong implications for retention-aware refresh mechanisms that leverage the heterogeneity in cell retention times: our detailed analyses show that ColumnDisturb greatly reduces the benefits of such mechanisms."

We find that the authors of Mess paper made multiple trivial human errors in both the configuration and usage of the simulators. We show that by correctly configuring Ramulator 2.0, Ramulator 2.0's simulated memory system performance actually resembles real system characteristics well, and thus a key claimed contribution of the Mess paper is factually incorrect. We also identify that the DAMOV simulation results in the Mess paper use wrong simulation statistics that are unrelated to the simulated DRAM performance. Moreover, the Mess paper's artifact repository lacks the necessary sources to fully reproduce all the Mess paper's results.Our work corrects the Mess paper's errors regarding Ramulator 2.0 and identifies important issues in the Mess paper's memory simulator evaluation methodology. We emphasize the importance of both carefully and rigorously validating simulation results and contacting simulator authors and developers, in true open source spirit, to ensure these simulators are used with correct configurations and as intended. We encourage the computer architecture community to correct the Mess paper's errors.

2510.15878,"Requests arriving at main memory are often different from what programmers can observe or estimate by using CPU-based monitoring. Hardware cache prefetching, memory request scheduling and interleaving cause a loss of observability that limits potential data movement and tiering optimizations. In response, memory-side telemetry hardware like page access heat map units (HMU) and page prefetchers were proposed to inform Operating Systems with accurate usage data. However, it is still hard to map memory activity to software program functions and objects because of the decoupled nature of host processors and memory devices. Valuable program context is stripped out from the memory bus, leaving only commands, addresses and data. Programmers have expert knowledge of future data accesses, priorities, and access to processor state, which could be useful hints for runtime memory device optimization. This paper makes context visible at memory devices by encoding any user-visible state as detectable packets in the memory read address stream, in a nondestructive manner without significant capacity overhead, drivers or special access privileges. We prototyped an end-to-end system with metadata injection that can be reliably detected and decoded from a memory address trace, either by a host processor, or a memory module. We illustrate a use case with precise code execution markers and object address range tracking. In the future, real time metadata decoding with near-memory computing (NMC) could provide customized telemetry and statistics to users, or act on application hints to perform functions like prioritizing requests, remapping data and reconfiguring devices."
2510.1588,"Although it is not a new concept, 3D integration increasingly receives widespread interest and focus as lithographic scaling becomes more challenging, and as the ability to make miniature vias greatly improves. Like Moores law, 3D integration improves density. With improvements in packaging density, however, come the challenges associated with its inherently higher power density. And though it acts somewhat as a scaling accelerator, the vertical integration also poses new challenges to design and manufacturing technologies. The placement of circuits, vias, and macros in the planes of a 3D stack must be co-designed across layers (or must conform to new standards) so that, when assembled, they have correct spatial correspondence. Each layer, although perhaps being a mere functional slice through a system (and we can slice the system in many different ways), must be independently testable so that we can systematically test and diagnose subsystems before and after final assembly. When those layers are assembled, they must come together in a way that enables a sensible yield and facilitates testing the finished product. To make the most of 3D integration, we should articulate the leverages of 3D systems (other researchers offer a more complete treatment elsewhere). Then we can enumerate and elucidate many of the new challenges posed by the design, assembly, and test of 3D systems."
2510.15882,"As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, multi-node deployment has become a necessity. Consequently, communication has become a critical performance bottleneck. Current intra-node communication libraries, like NCCL, typically make use of a single interconnect such as NVLink. This approach creates performance ceilings, especially on hardware like the H800 GPU where the primary interconnect's bandwidth can become a bottleneck, and leaves other hardware resources like PCIe and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)-capable Network Interface Cards (NICs) largely idle during intensive workloads. We propose FlexLink, the first collective communication framework to the best of our knowledge designed to systematically address this by aggregating these heterogeneous links-NVLink, PCIe, and RDMA NICs-into a single, high-performance communication fabric. FlexLink employs an effective two-stage adaptive load balancing strategy that dynamically partitions communication traffic across all available links, ensuring that faster interconnects are not throttled by slower ones. On an 8-GPU H800 server, our design improves the bandwidth of collective operators such as AllReduce and AllGather by up to 26% and 27% over the NCCL baseline, respectively. This gain is achieved by offloading 2-22% of the total communication traffic to the previously underutilized PCIe and RDMA NICs. FlexLink provides these improvements as a lossless, drop-in replacement compatible with the NCCL API, ensuring easy adoption."
2510.15884,"Numerical features of matrix multiplier hardware units in NVIDIA and AMD data centre GPUs have recently been studied. Features such as rounding, normalisation, and internal precision of the accumulators are of interest. In this paper, we extend the methodology for analysing those features, to consumer-grade NVIDIA GPUs by implementing an architecture-independent test scheme for various input and output precision formats. Unlike current approaches, the proposed test vector generation method neither performs an exhaustive search nor relies on hard-coded {constants that are device-specific, yet remains applicable to a wide range of mixed-precision formats. We have applied the scheme to the RTX-3060 (Ampere architecture), and Ada RTX-1000 (Ada Lovelace architecture) graphics cards and determined numerical features of matrix multipliers for binary16, TensorFloat32, and bfloat16 input floating point formats and binary16 and binary32 IEEE 754 output formats. Our methodology allowed us to determine that} the numerical features of RTX-3060, a consumer-grade GPU, are identical to those of the A100, a data centre GPU. We do not expect our code to require any changes for performing analysis of matrix multipliers on newer NVIDIA GPUs, Hopper or Blackwell, and their future successors, and any input/output format combination, including the latest 8-bit floating-point formats."
2510.15885,"To facilitate the understanding and efficient enhancement of software and hardware design for consumer-grade zoned flash storage, ConZone is proposed as the first emulator designed to model the resource constraints and architectural features typical of such systems. It incorporates essential components commonly deployed in consumer-grade devices, including limited logical to physical mapping caches, constrained write buffers, and hybrid flash media management. However, ConZone cannot be mounted with the file system due to the lack of in-place update capability, which is required by the metadata area of F2FS. To improve the usability of the emulator, ConZone+ extends ConZone with support for a block interface. We also provide a script to help the deployment and introduces several enhancements over the original version. Users can explore the internal architecture of consumer-grade zoned flash storage and integrate their optimizations with system software using ConZone+. We validate the accuracy of ConZone+ by comparing a hardware architecture representative of consumer-grade zoned flash storage and comparing it with the state-of-the-art. In addition, we conduct several case studies using ConZone+ to investigate the design of zoned storage and explore the inadequacies of the current file system."
2510.15887,"This paper introduces BASIC_RV32s, an open-source framework providing a practical microarchitectural roadmap for the RISC-V RV32I architecture, addressing the gap between theoretical knowledge and hardware implementation. Following the classic Patterson and Hennessy methodology, the design evolves from a basic single-cycle core to a 5-stage pipelined core design with full hazard forwarding, dynamic branch prediction, and exception handling. For verification, the final core design is integrated into a System-on-Chip (SoC) with Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) communication implemented on a Xilinx Artix-7 Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), achieving 1.09 Dhrystone million instructions per second per megahertz (DMIPS/MHz) at 50 MHz. By releasing all Register-Transfer Level (RTL) source code, signal-level logic block diagrams, and development logs under MIT license on GitHub, BASIC_RV32s offers a reproducible instructional pathway for the open-source hardware ecosystem."
2510.15888,"Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) allows lock-free programming as easy as with traditional coarse-grain locks or similar, while benefiting from the performance advantages of fine-grained locking. Many HTM implementations have been proposed, but they have not received widespread adoption because of their high hardware complexity, their need for additions to the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), and often for modifications to the cache coherence protocol.We show that HTM can be implemented without adding new instructions -- merely by extending the semantics of two existing, Load-Linked and Store-Conditional. Also, our proposed design does not modify or extend standard coherence protocols. We further propose to drastically simplify the implementation of HTM -- confined to modifications in the L1 Data Cache only -- by restricting it to applications where the write set plus the read set of each transaction do not exceed a small number of cache lines. We also propose two alternative mechanisms to guarantee forward progress, both based on detecting retrial attempts.We simulated our proposed design in Gem5, and we used it to implement several popular concurrent data structures, showing that a maximum of eight (8) words (cache lines) suffice for the write plus read sets. We provide a detailed explanation of selected implementations, clarifying the intended usage of our HTM from a programmer's perspective. We evaluated our HTM under varying contention levels to explore its scalability limits. The results indicate that our HTM provides good performance in concurrent data structures when contention is spread across multiple nodes: in such cases, the percentage of aborts relative to successful commits is very low. In the atomic fetch-and-increment benchmark for multiple shared counters, the results show that, under low-congestion, our HTM improves performance relative to the TTS lock."
2510.15893,"The unabated growth in AI workload demands is driving the need for concerted advances in compute, memory, and interconnect performance. As traditional semiconductor scaling slows, high-speed interconnects have emerged as the new scaling engine, enabling the creation of larger logical GPUs by linking many GPUs into a single, low-latency, high-bandwidth compute domain. While initial scale-up fabrics leveraged copper interconnects for their power and cost advantages, the maximum reach of passive electrical interconnects (approximately 1 meter) effectively limits the scale-up domain to within a single rack. The advent of 3D-stacked optics and logic offers a transformative, power-efficient scale-up solution for connecting hundreds of GPU packages (thousands of GPUs) across multiple data center racks. This work explores the design tradeoffs of scale-up technologies and demonstrates how frontier LLMs necessitate novel photonic solutions to achieve aggressive power and performance targets. We model the benefits of 3D CPO (Passage) enabled GPUs and switches within the scale-up domain when training Frontier Mixture of Experts (MoE) models exceeding one trillion parameters. Our results show that the substantial increases in bandwidth and radix enabled by 3D CPO allow for an 8X increase in scale-up capability. This affords new opportunities for multi-dimensional parallelism within the scale-up domain and results in a 2.7X reduction in time-to-train, unlocking unprecedented model scaling."
2510.15897,"Chip placement, the task of determining optimal positions of circuit modules on a chip canvas, is a critical step in the VLSI design flow that directly impacts performance, power consumption, and routability. Traditional methods rely on analytical optimization or reinforcement learning, which struggle with hard placement constraints or require expensive online training for each new circuit design. To address these limitations, we introduce DiffPlace, a framework that formulates chip placement as a conditional denoising diffusion process, enabling transferable placement policies that generalize to unseen circuit netlists without retraining. DiffPlace leverages the generative capabilities of diffusion models to efficiently explore the vast space of placement while conditioning on circuit connectivity and relative quality metrics to identify optimal solutions globally. Our approach combines energy-guided sampling with constrained manifold diffusion to ensure placement legality, achieving extremely low overlap across all experimental scenarios. Our method bridges the gap between optimization-based and learning-based approaches, offering a practical path toward automated, high-quality chip placement for modern VLSI design.

2510.15899,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining prominence in various fields, thanks to their ability to generate high- quality content from human instructions. This paper delves into the field of chip design using LLMs, specifically in Power- Performance-Area (PPA) optimization and the generation of accurate Verilog codes for circuit designs. We introduce a novel framework VeriPPA designed to optimize PPA and generate Verilog code using LLMs. Our method includes a two-stage process where the first stage focuses on improving the functional and syntactic correctness of the generated Verilog codes, while the second stage focuses on optimizing the Verilog codes to meet PPA constraints of circuit designs, a crucial element of chip design. Our framework achieves an 81.37% success rate in syntactic correctness and 62.06% in functional correctness for code genera- tion, outperforming current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. On the RTLLM dataset.

The framework automates key processes, including vPlan generation, testbench creation, regression execution, and reporting in a requirements management tool, drastically reducing verification effort. This approach accelerates development cycles, minimizes human error, and enhances coverage, offering a scalable and efficient solution to the challenges of verifying configurable IPs."
2510.15904,"The rapid growth of deep neural network (DNN) workloads has significantly increased the demand for large-capacity on-chip SRAM in machine learning (ML) applications, with SRAM arrays now occupying a substantial fraction of the total die area. To address the dual challenges of storage density and computation efficiency, this paper proposes an NVM-in-Cache architecture that integrates resistive RAM (RRAM) devices into a conventional 6T-SRAM cell, forming a compact 6T-2R bit-cell. This hybrid cell enables Processing-in-Memory (PIM) mode, which performs massively parallel multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations directly on cache power lines while preserving stored cache data. By exploiting the intrinsic properties of the 6T-2R structure, the architecture achieves additional storage capability, high computational throughput without any bit-cell area overhead. Circuit- and array-level simulations in GlobalFoundries 22nm FDSOI technology demonstrate that the proposed design achieves a throughput of 0.4 TOPS and 491.78 TOPS/W. For 128 row-parallel operations, the CIFAR-10 classification is demonstrated by mapping a Resnet-18 neural network, achieving an accuracy of 91.27%. These results highlight the potential of the NVM-in-Cache approach to serve as a scalable, energy-efficient computing method by re-purposing existing 6T SRAM cache architecture for next-generation AI accelerators and general purpose processors."
2510.15906,"Debugging formal verification (FV) failures represents one of the most time-consuming bottlenecks in modern hardware design workflows. When properties fail, engineers must manually trace through complex counter-examples spanning multiple cycles, analyze waveforms, and cross-reference design specifications to identify root causes - a process that can consume hours or days per bug. Existing solutions are largely limited to manual waveform viewers or simple automated tools that cannot reason about the complex interplay between design intent and implementation logic. We present FVDebug, an intelligent system that automates root-cause analysis by combining multiple data sources - waveforms, RTL code, design specifications - to transform failure traces into actionable insights. Our approach features a novel pipeline: (1) Causal Graph Synthesis that structures failure traces into directed acyclic graphs, (2) Graph Scanner using batched Large Language Model (LLM) analysis with for-and-against prompting to identify suspicious nodes, and (3) Insight Rover leveraging agentic narrative exploration to generate high-level causal explanations. FVDebug further provides concrete RTL fixes through its Fix Generator. Evaluated on open benchmarks, FVDebug attains high hypothesis quality and strong Pass@k fix rates. We further report results on two proprietary, production-scale FV counterexamples. These results demonstrate FVDebug's applicability from academic benchmarks to industrial designs."
2510.15907,"We propose a novel approach to symbolic timing analysis for digital integrated circuits based on recently developed analytic delay formulas for 2-input NOR, NAND, and Muller-C gates by Ferdowsi et al. (NAHS 2025). Given a fixed order of the transitions of all input and internal signals of a circuit, our framework computes closed-form analytic delay expressions for all the internal signal transition times that depend on (i) the symbolic transition times of the relevant input signals and (ii) the model parameters of the relevant gates. The resulting formulas facilitate per-transition timing analysis without any simulation, by instantiating the symbolic input transition times and the gate parameters. More importantly, however, they also enable an \emph{analytic} study of the dependencies of certain timing properties on input signals and gate parameters. For instance, differentiating a symbolic delay expression with respect to a gate parameter or input transition time enables sensitivity analysis. As a proof of concept, we implement our approach using the computer algebra system SageMath and apply it to the NOR-gate version of the c17 slack benchmark circuit."
2510.15908,"Finite element simulations are essential in biomechanics, enabling detailed modeling of tissues and organs. However, architectural inefficiencies in current hardware and software stacks limit performance and scalability, especially for iterative tasks like material parameter identification. As a result, workflows often sacrifice fidelity for tractability. Reconfigurable hardware, such as FPGAs, offers a promising path to domain-specific acceleration without the cost of ASICs, but its potential in biomechanics remains underexplored. This paper presents Belenos, a comprehensive workload characterization of finite element biomechanics using FEBio, a widely adopted simulator, gem5 sensitivity studies, and VTune analysis. VTune results reveal that smaller workloads experience moderate front-end stalls, typically around 13.1%, whereas larger workloads are dominated by significant back-end bottlenecks, with backend-bound cycles ranging from 59.9% to over 82.2%. Complementary gem5 sensitivity studies identify optimal hardware configurations for Domain-Specific Accelerators (DSA), showing that suboptimal pipeline, memory, or branch predictor settings can degrade performance by up to 37.1%. These findings underscore the need for architecture-aware co-design to efficiently support biomechanical simulation workloads."
2510.1591,"Modern heterogeneous System-on-Chip (SoC) devices integrate advanced components into a single package, offering powerful capabilities while also introducing significant complexity. To manage these sophisticated devices, firmware and software developers need powerful development tools. However, as these tools become increasingly complex, they often lack adequate support, resulting in a steep learning curve and challenging troubleshooting. To address this, this work introduces System-on-Chip blocks (SoCks), a flexible and expandable build framework that reduces complexity by partitioning the SoC image into high-level units called blocks. SoCks builds each firmware and software block in an encapsulated way, independently from other components of the image, thereby reducing dependencies to a minimum. While some information exchange between the blocks is unavoidable to ensure seamless runtime integration, this interaction is standardized via interfaces. A small number of dependencies and well-defined interfaces simplify the reuse of existing block implementations and facilitate seamless substitution between versions-for instance, when choosing root file systems for the embedded Linux operating system. Additionally, this approach facilitates the establishment of a decentralized and partially automated development flow through Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). Measurement results demonstrate that SoCks can build a complete SoC image up to three times faster than established tools."
2510.15914,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating Verilog code from natural language descriptions. However, Verilog code inherently encodes structural information of hardware circuits. Effectively leveraging this structural information to enhance the functional and syntactic correctness of LLM-generated Verilog code remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose VeriGRAG , a novel framework that extracts structural graph embeddings from Verilog code using graph neural networks (GNNs). A multimodal retriever then selects the graph embeddings most relevant to the given generation task, which are aligned with the code modality through the VeriFormer module to generate structure-aware soft prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that VeriGRAG substantially improves the correctness of Verilog code generation, achieving state-of-the-art or superior performance across both VerilogEval and RTLLM benchmarks."
2510.15917,"Existing storage systems lack visibility into workload intent, limiting their ability to adapt to the semantics of modern, large-scale data-intensive applications. This disconnect leads to brittle heuristics and fragmented, siloed optimizations. To address these limitations, we propose Intent-Driven Storage Systems (IDSS), a vision for a new paradigm where large language models (LLMs) infer workload and system intent from unstructured signals to guide adaptive and cross-layer parameter reconfiguration. IDSS provides holistic reasoning for competing demands, synthesizing safe and efficient decisions within policy guardrails. We present four design principles for integrating LLMs into storage control loops and propose a corresponding system architecture. Initial results on FileBench workloads show that IDSS can improve IOPS by up to 2.45X by interpreting intent and generating actionable configurations for storage components such as caching and prefetching. These findings suggest that, when constrained by guardrails and embedded within structured workflows, LLMs can function as high-level semantic optimizers, bridging the gap between application goals and low-level system control. IDSS points toward a future in which storage systems are increasingly adaptive, autonomous, and aligned with dynamic workload demands."
2510.15926,"With the emergence of wearable devices and other embedded systems, deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge platforms has become an urgent need. However, this is challenging because of their high computational and memory demands. Although recent low-bit quantization methods (e.g., BitNet, DeepSeek) compress weights to as low as 1.58~bits with minimal accuracy loss, edge deployment is still constrained by limited on-chip resources, power budgets, and the often-neglected long latency of the prefill stage. We present \textbf{TeLLMe}, the first table-lookup-based ternary LLM accelerator for low-power edge FPGAs that fully supports both prefill and autoregressive decoding using 1.58-bit weights and 8-bit activations. TeLLMe incorporates several novel techniques, including (1) a table-lookup-based ternary matrix multiplication (TLMM) engine utilizing grouped activations and online precomputation for low resource utilization and high throughput; (2) a fine-grained analytic URAM-based weight buffer management scheme for efficient loading and compute engine access; (3) a streaming dataflow architecture that fuses floating-point element-wise operations with linear computations to hide latency; (4) a reversed-reordered prefill stage attention with fused attention operations for high memory efficiency; and (5) a resource-efficient specialized decoding stage attention. Under a 5~W power budget, TeLLMe delivers up to 25~tokens/s decoding throughput and 0.45--0.96~s time-to-first-token (TTFT) for 64--128 token prompts, marking a significant energy-efficiency advancement in LLM inference on edge FPGAs."
2510.15927,"Developing kernels for Processing-In-Memory (PIM) platforms poses unique challenges in data management and parallel programming on limited processing units. Although software development kits (SDKs) for PIM, such as the UPMEM SDK, provide essential tools, these emerging platforms still leave significant room for performance optimization. In this paper, we reveal surprising inefficiencies in UPMEM software stack and play with non-standard programming techniques. By making simple modifications to the assembly generated by the UPMEM compiler, we achieve speedups of 1.6-2x in integer addition and 1.4-5.9x in integer multiplication, depending on the data type. We also demonstrate that bit-serial processing of low precision data is a viable option for UPMEM: in INT4 bit-serial dot-product calculation, UPMEM can achieve over 2.7x speedup over the baseline. Minor API extensions for PIM allocation that account for the non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture of the server further improve the consistency and throughput of host-PIM data transfers by up to 2.9x. Finally, we show that, when the matrix is preloaded into PIM, our optimized kernels outperform a dual-socket CPU server by over 3x for INT8 generalized matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV) and by 10x for INT4 GEMV. Our optimized INT8 GEMV kernel outperforms the baseline 3.5x."
2510.1593,"Implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has emerged as a promising alternative to GPUs, offering lower latency, greater power efficiency and greater flexibility. However, this development remains complex due to the hardware knowledge required and the long synthesis, placement and routing stages, which slow down design cycles and prevent rapid exploration of network configurations, making resource optimisation under severe constraints particularly challenging. This paper proposes a library of configurable convolution Blocks designed to optimize FPGA implementation and adapt to available resources. It also presents a methodological framework for developing mathematical models that predict FPGA resources utilization. The approach is validated by analyzing the correlation between the parameters, followed by error metrics. The results show that the designed blocks enable adaptation of convolution layers to hardware constraints, and that the models accurately predict resource consumption, providing a useful tool for FPGA selection and optimized CNN deployment."
2510.1604,"Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is crucial for reducing latency, improving real-time processing, and enhancing privacy. By performing inference directly on the device, data does not need to be sent to the cloud, ensuring faster responses and reducing reliance on network connectivity. However, implementing LLMs on edge devices presents challenges, particularly with managing key-value (KV) caches, which plays a pivotal role in LLM serving. As the input text lengthens, the size of the KV cache increases linearly with the sequence length, leading to a significant memory footprint and data access costs. On the other hand, edge devices have limited memory and computational power, making it hard to store and efficiently access the large caches needed for LLM inference.To mitigate the substantial overhead caused by KV cache, we propose using embedded DRAM (eDRAM) as the primary storage for LLM serving in edge device, which offers higher storage density compared to SRAM. However, to ensure data integrity, eDRAM needs periodic refresh operations, which are power-intensive. To reduce eDRAM costs and improve overall system performance, we propose~\textit{Kelle}, a software-hardware co-design solution optimized for deploying LLMs on eDRAM-based edge systems. Combined with our fine-grained memory eviction, recomputation, and refresh control algorithms, the \textit{Kelle} accelerator delivers a $3.9\times$ speedup and $4.5\times$ energy savings compared to existing baseline solutions."

2510.16622,"The vehicular density in urbanizing cities of developing countries such as Dhaka, Bangladesh result in a lot of traffic congestion, causing poor on-road experiences. Traffic signaling is a key component in effective traffic management for such situations, but the advancements in intelligent traffic signaling have been exclusive to developed countries with structured traffic. The non-lane-based, heterogeneous traffic of Dhaka City requires a contextual approach. This study focuses on the development of an intelligent traffic signaling system feasible in the context of developing countries such as Bangladesh. We propose a pipeline leveraging Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) feeds, a low resources system Raspberry Pi 4B processing, and a state of the art YOLO-based object detection model trained on the Non-lane-based and Heterogeneous Traffic (NHT-1071) dataset to detect and classify heterogeneous traffic. A multi-objective optimization algorithm, NSGA-II, then generates optimized signal timings, minimizing waiting time while maximizing vehicle throughput.

The developed testbed paves the way for more contextual and effective Intelligent Traffic Signaling (ITS) solutions for developing areas with complicated traffic dynamics such as Dhaka City."
2510.17251,"This paper proposes smaRTLy: a new optimization technique for multiplexers in Register-Transfer Level (RTL) logic synthesis. Multiplexer trees are very common in RTL designs, and traditional tools like Yosys optimize them by traversing the tree and monitoring control port values. However, this method does not fully exploit the intrinsic logical relationships among signals or the potential for structural optimization. To address these limitations, we develop innovative strategies to remove redundant multiplexer trees and restructure the remaining ones, significantly reducing the overall gate count. We evaluate smaRTLy on the IWLS-2005 and RISC-V benchmarks, achieving an additional 8.95% reduction in AIG area compared to Yosys. We also evaluate smaRTLy on an industrial benchmark in the scale of millions of gates, results show that smaRTLy can remove 47.2% more AIG area than Yosys. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our logic inferencing and structural rebuilding techniques in enhancing the RTL optimization process, leading to more efficient hardware designs."

We propose SPEQ, an algorithm-hardware co-designed speculative decoding method that uses part of the full-model weight bits to form a quantized draft model, thereby eliminating additional training or storage overhead. A reconfigurable processing element array enables efficient execution of both the draft and verification passes. Experimental results across 15 LLMs and tasks demonstrate that SPEQ achieves speedups of 2.07x, 1.53x, and 1.45x compared over FP16, Olive, and Tender, respectively."
2511.00075,"Quarter level cell (QLC) 3D NAND flash memory is emerging as the predominant storage solution in the era of artificial intelligence. QLC 3D NAND flash stores 4 bit per cell to expand the storage density, resulting in narrower read margins. Constrained to read margins, QLC always suffers from lateral charge migration (LCM), which caused by non-uniform charge density across adjacent memory cells. To suppress charge density gap between cells, there are some algorithm in form of intra-page data mapping such as WBVM, DVDS. However, we observe inter-page data arrangements also approach the suppression. Thus, we proposed an intelligent model PDA-LSTM to arrange intra-page data for LCM suppression, which is a physics-knowledge-driven neural network model. PDA-LSTM applies a long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network to compute a data arrangement probability matrix from input page data pattern. The arrangement is to minimize the global impacts derived from the LCM among wordlines. Since each page data can be arranged only once, we design a transformation from output matrix of LSTM network to non-repetitive sequence generation probability matrix to assist training process. The arranged data pattern can decrease the bit error rate (BER) during data retention. In addition, PDA-LSTM do not need extra flag bits to record data transport of 3D NAND flash compared with WBVM, DVDS. The experiment results show that the PDA-LSTM reduces the average BER by 80.4% compared with strategy without data arrangement, and by 18.4%, 15.2% compared respectively with WBVM and DVDS with code-length 64."

2511.00295,"Transformers have significantly advanced AI and machine learning through their powerful attention mechanism. However, computing attention on long sequences can become a computational bottleneck. FlashAttention mitigates this by fusing the softmax and matrix operations into a tiled computation pattern that decouples performance from sequence length. Though designed for GPUs, its simplicity also makes it well suited for direct hardware acceleration. To improve hardware implementation, we compute FlashAttention using a mixture of floating-point and fixed-point logarithm domain representations. Floating-point is used to compute attention scores from query and key matrices, while logarithmic computation simplifies the fused computation of softmax normalization and the multiplication with the value matrix. This transformation, called H-FA, replaces vector-wide floating-point multiplication and division operations by additions and subtractions implemented efficiently with fixed-point arithmetic in the logarithm domain. Exponential function evaluations are effectively omitted and fused with the rest operations, and the final result is directly returned to floating-point arithmetic without any additional hardware overhead. Hardware implementation results at 28nm demonstrate that H-FA achieves a 26.5% reduction in area and a 23.4% reduction in power, on average, compared to FlashAttention parallel hardware architectures built solely with floating-point datapaths, without hindering performance."

While Compute Express Link (CXL) enables non-eviction frameworks that offload the full KV-cache to scalable external memory, these frameworks still suffer from costly data transfers when recalling non-resident KV tokens to limited GPU memory as context lengths increase. This work proposes scalable Processing-Near-Memory (PNM) for 1M-Token LLM Inference, a CXL-enabled KV-cache management system that coordinates memory and computation beyond GPU limits. Our design offloads token page selection to a PNM accelerator within CXL memory, eliminating costly recalls and enabling larger GPU batch sizes. We further introduce a hybrid parallelization strategy and a steady-token selection mechanism to enhance compute efficiency and scalability. Implemented atop a state-of-the-art CXL-PNM system, our solution delivers consistent performance gains for LLMs with up to 405B parameters and 1M-token contexts. Our PNM-only offloading scheme (PNM-KV) and GPU-PNM hybrid with steady-token execution (PnG-KV) achieve up to 21.9x throughput improvement, up to 60x lower energy per token, and up to 7.3x better total cost efficiency than the baseline, demonstrating that CXL-enabled multi-PNM architectures can serve as a scalable backbone for future long-context LLM inference."
2511.01244,"This paper focuses on the simulation of multi-die System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures using VisualSim, emphasiz- ing chiplet-based system modeling and performance analysis. Chiplet technology presents a promising alternative to traditional monolithic chips, which face increasing challenges in manufactur- ing costs, power efficiency, and performance scaling. By integrat- ing multiple small modular silicon units into a single package, chiplet-based architectures offer greater flexibility and scalability at a lower overall cost. In this study, we developed a detailed sim- ulation model of a chiplet-based system, incorporating multicore ARM processor clusters interconnected through a ARM CMN600 network-on-chip (NoC) for efficient communication [4], [7]. The simulation framework in VisualSim enables the evaluation of critical system metrics, including inter-chiplet communication latency, memory access efficiency, workload distribution, and the power-performance tradeoff under various workloads. Through simulation-driven insights, this research highlights key factors influencing chiplet system performance and provides a foundation for optimizing future chiplet-based semiconductor designs."
2511.02132,"The rise of disaggregated AI GPUs has exposed a critical bottleneck in large-scale attention workloads: non-uniform memory access (NUMA). As multi-chiplet designs become the norm for scaling compute capabilities, memory latency and bandwidth vary sharply across compute regions, undermining the performance of traditional GPU kernel scheduling strategies that assume uniform memory access. We identify how these NUMA effects distort locality in multi-head attention (MHA) and present Swizzled Head-first Mapping, a spatially-aware scheduling strategy that aligns attention heads with GPU NUMA domains to exploit intra-chiplet cache reuse. On AMD's MI300X architecture, our method achieves up to 50% higher performance over state-of-the-art attention algorithms using conventional scheduling techniques and sustains consistently high L2 cache hit rates of 80-97%. These results demonstrate that NUMA-aware scheduling is now fundamental to achieving full efficiency on next-generation disaggregated GPUs, offering a path forward for scalable AI training and inference."
2511.02196,"Boolean equivalence allows Boolean networks with identical functionality to exhibit diverse graph structures. This gives more room for exploration in logic optimization, while also posing a challenge for tasks involving consistency between Boolean networks. To tackle this challenge, we introduce BoolSkeleton, a novel Boolean network skeletonization method that improves the consistency and reliability of design-specific evaluations. BoolSkeleton comprises two key steps: preprocessing and reduction. In preprocessing, the Boolean network is transformed into a defined Boolean dependency graph, where nodes are assigned the functionality-related status. Next, the homogeneous and heterogeneous patterns are defined for the node-level pattern reduction step. Heterogeneous patterns are preserved to maintain critical functionality-related dependencies, while homogeneous patterns can be reduced. Parameter K of the pattern further constrains the fanin size of these patterns, enabling fine-tuned control over the granularity of graph reduction. To validate BoolSkeleton's effectiveness, we conducted four analysis/downstream tasks around the Boolean network: compression analysis, classification, critical path analysis, and timing prediction, demonstrating its robustness across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, it improves above 55% in the average accuracy compared to the original Boolean network for the timing prediction task. These experiments underscore the potential of BoolSkeleton to enhance design consistency in logic synthesis."
2511.02269,"The rise of generative AI for tasks like Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has created a critical energy consumption challenge. While ASICs offer high efficiency, they lack the programmability to adapt to evolving algorithms. To address this trade-off, we implement and evaluate Whisper's core computational kernel on the IMAX, a general-purpose Coarse-Grained Linear Arrays (CGLAs) accelerator. To our knowledge, this is the first work to execute a Whisper kernel on a CGRA and compare its performance against CPUs and GPUs. Using hardware/software co-design, we evaluate our system via an FPGA prototype and project performance for a 28 nm ASIC. Our results demonstrate superior energy efficiency. The projected ASIC is 1.90x more energy-efficient than the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin and 9.83x more than an NVIDIA RTX 4090 for the Q8_0 model. This work positions CGLA as a promising platform for sustainable ASR on power-constrained edge devices."
2511.02285,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in generating Verilog codes, but ensuring functional correctness remains a challenge. Existing approaches often rely on self-consistency or simulation feedback to select the best candidate, but they miss opportunities to focus LLM reasoning on the most informative parts of the design. We propose VFocus, a three-stage framework that enhances Verilog generation by sharpening the focus of LLM reasoning onto critical decision points in the code generation process. In the \textbf{pre-ranking stage}, VFocus generates multiple code candidates through LLM prompting, retries for syntactically valid outputs, and introduces a \textit{Density-guided Filtering} to retain candidates that fall within the ""reasoning sweet spot"" for functional correctness. In the \textbf{ranking stage}, we simulate each code candidate using an automatically generated testbench and apply self-consistency-based clustering to identify the most consistent outputs. Finally, in the \textbf{post-ranking refinement stage}, VFocus performs inconsistency mining on top-ranked candidates and invokes reasoning-augmented LLM prompts for candidate refinement. Experiments on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark show that VFocus significantly improves the pass@1 correctness across multiple reasoning LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing Verilog generation for complex hardware design tasks."
2511.02408,"In this paper, we implement a stand-alone facial expression recognition system on an SoC FPGA with multi-threading using a Deep learning Processor Unit (DPU). The system consists of two steps: one for face detection step and one for facial expression recognition. In the previous work, the Haar Cascade detector was run on a CPU in the face detection step due to FPGA resource limitations, but this detector is less accurate for profile and variable illumination condition images. Moreover, the previous work used a dedicated circuit accelerator, so running a second DNN inference for face detection on the FPGA would require the addition of a new accelerator. As an alternative to this approach, we run the two inferences by DNN on a DPU, which is a general-purpose CNN accelerator of the systolic array type. Our method for face detection using DenseBox and facial expression recognition using CNN on the same DPU enables the efficient use of FPGA resources while maintaining a small circuit size. We also developed a multi-threading technique that improves the overall throughput while increasing the DPU utilization efficiency. With this approach, we achieved an overall system throughput of 25 FPS and a throughput per power consumption of 2.4 times."

Our approach incorporates hardware-centric optimizations including redundant arithmetic, on-the-fly quotient conversion, and operand scaling to streamline the division process while mitigating latency, area, and power overheads. Comprehensive synthesis evaluations across multiple posit configurations demonstrate significant performance improvements, including more than 80% energy reduction with small area overhead compared to existing methods, and a substantial decrease in the number of iterations. These results underscore the potential of our adapted algorithm to enhance the efficiency of posit-based arithmetic units."
2511.03079,"FPGAs have been shown to be a promising platform for deploying Quantised Neural Networks (QNNs) with high-speed, low-latency, and energy-efficient inference. However, the complexity of modern deep-learning models limits the performance on resource-constrained edge devices. While quantisation and pruning alleviate these challenges, unstructured sparsity remains underexploited due to irregular memory access. This work introduces a framework that embeds unstructured sparsity into dataflow accelerators, eliminating the need for dedicated sparse engines and preserving parallelism. A hardware-aware pruning strategy is introduced to improve efficiency and design flow further. On LeNet-5, the framework attains 51.6 x compression and 1.23 x throughput improvement using only 5.12% of LUTs, effectively exploiting unstructured sparsity for QNN acceleration."
2511.03203,"The application of Magnetic Random-Access Memory (MRAM) in computing-in-memory (CIM) has gained significant attention. However, existing designs often suffer from high energy consumption due to their reliance on complex analog circuits for computation. In this work, we present a Spin-Orbit- Torque MRAM(SOT-MRAM)-based CIM macro that employs an event-driven spiking processing for high energy efficiency. The SOT-MRAM crossbar adopts a hybrid series-parallel cell structure to efficiently support matrix-vector multiplication (MVM). Signal information is (en) decoded as spikes using lightweight circuits, eliminating the need for conventional area- and powerintensive analog circuits. The SOT-MRAM macro is designed and evaluated in 28nm technology, and experimental results show that it achieves a peak energy efficiency of 243.6 TOPS/W, significantly outperforming existing designs."
2511.03427,"Flexible Electronics (FE) have emerged as a promising alternative to silicon-based technologies, offering on-demand low-cost fabrication, conformality, and sustainability. However, their large feature sizes severely limit integration density, imposing strict area and power constraints, thus prohibiting the realization of Machine Learning (ML) circuits, which can significantly enhance the capabilities of relevant near-sensor applications. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) offer high accuracy in such applications at relatively low computational complexity, satisfying FE technologies' constraints. Existing SVM designs rely solely on linear or Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels, forcing a trade-off between hardware costs and accuracy. Linear kernels, implemented digitally, minimize overhead but sacrifice performance, while the more accurate RBF kernels are prohibitively large in digital, and their analog realization contains inherent functional approximation. In this work, we propose the first mixed-kernel and mixed-signal SVM design in FE, which unifies the advantages of both implementations and balances the cost/accuracy trade-off. To that end, we introduce a co-optimization approach that trains our mixed-kernel SVMs and maps binary SVM classifiers to the appropriate kernel (linear/RBF) and domain (digital/analog), aiming to maximize accuracy whilst reducing the number of costly RBF classifiers. Our designs deliver 7.7% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art single-kernel linear SVMs, and reduce area and power by 108x and 17x on average compared to digital RBF implementations."
2511.03944,"In 1987, Jim Gray and Gianfranco Putzolu introduced the five-minute rule, a simple, storage-memory-economics-based heuristic for deciding when data should live in DRAM rather than on storage. Subsequent revisits to the rule largely retained that economics-only view, leaving host costs, feasibility limits, and workload behavior out of scope. This paper revisits the rule from first principles, integrating host costs, DRAM bandwidth/capacity, and physics-grounded models of SSD performance and cost, and then embedding these elements in a constraint- and workload-aware framework that yields actionable provisioning guidance. We show that, for modern AI platforms, especially GPU-centric hosts paired with ultra-high-IOPS SSDs engineered for fine-grained random access, the DRAM-to-flash caching threshold collapses from minutes to a few seconds. This shift reframes NAND flash memory as an active data tier and exposes a broad research space across the hardware-software stack. We further introduce MQSim-Next, a calibrated SSD simulator that supports validation and sensitivity analysis and facilitates future architectural and system research. Finally, we present two concrete case studies that showcase the software system design space opened by such memory hierarchy paradigm shift. Overall, we turn a classical heuristic into an actionable, feasibility-aware analysis and provisioning framework and set the stage for further research on AI-era memory hierarchy."

In this article, we provide an overview of the motivations and recent advancements in hardware disaggregation. We further discuss the research challenges and opportunities associated with disaggregated architectures, focusing on aspects that have received limited attention. We argue that hardware disaggregation has the potential to reshape the entire DC ecosystem, impacting application design, resource scheduling, hardware configuration, cooling, and power system optimization. Additionally, we present a numerical study to illustrate several key aspects of these challenges."
2511.04321,"SRAM Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as the most promising implementation for high-performance PIM, delivering superior computing density, energy efficiency, and computational precision. However, the pursuit of higher performance necessitates more complex circuit designs and increased operating frequencies, which exacerbate IR-drop issues. Severe IR-drop can significantly degrade chip performance and even threaten reliability. Conventional circuit-level IR-drop mitigation methods, such as back-end optimizations, are resource-intensive and often compromise power, performance, and area (PPA). To address these challenges, we propose AIM, comprehensive software and hardware co-design for architecture-level IR-drop mitigation in high-performance PIM. Initially, leveraging the bit-serial and in-situ dataflow processing properties of PIM, we introduce Rtog and HR, which establish a direct correlation between PIM workloads and IR-drop. Building on this foundation, we propose LHR and WDS, enabling extensive exploration of architecture-level IR-drop mitigation while maintaining computational accuracy through software optimization. Subsequently, we develop IR-Booster, a dynamic adjustment mechanism that integrates software-level HR information with hardware-based IR-drop monitoring to adapt the V-f pairs of the PIM macro, achieving enhanced energy efficiency and performance. Finally, we propose the HR-aware task mapping method, bridging software and hardware designs to achieve optimal improvement. Post-layout simulation results on a 7nm 256-TOPS PIM chip demonstrate that AIM achieves up to 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, resulting in 2.29x energy efficiency improvement and 1.152x speedup."

However, as the number of accelerators per node increases, communication bottlenecks emerge both within and between nodes, particularly when network resources are shared among heterogeneous components."
2511.04682,"In-Memory Computing (IMC) represents a paradigm shift in deep learning acceleration by mitigating data movement bottlenecks and leveraging the inherent parallelism of memory-based computations. The efficient deployment of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on IMC-based hardware necessitates the use of advanced task allocation strategies for achieving maximum computational efficiency. In this work, we exploit an IMC Emulator (IMCE) with multiple Processing Units (PUs) for investigating how the deployment of a CNN model in a multi-processing system affects its performance, in terms of processing rate and latency. For that purpose, we introduce the Load-Balance-Longest-Path (LBLP) algorithm, that dynamically assigns all CNN nodes to the available IMCE PUs, for maximizing the processing rate and minimizing latency due to efficient resources utilization. We are benchmarking LBLP against other alternative scheduling strategies for a number of CNN models and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."
2511.04684,"Data centers handle vast volumes of data that require efficient lossless compression, yet emerging probabilistic models based methods are often computationally slow. To address this, we introduce RAS, the Range Asymmetric Numeral System Acceleration System, a hardware architecture that integrates the rANS algorithm into a lossless compression pipeline and eliminates key bottlenecks. RAS couples an rANS core with a probabilistic generator, storing distributions in BF16 format and converting them once into a fixed-point domain shared by a unified division/modulo datapath. A two-stage rANS update with byte-level re-normalization reduces logic cost and memory traffic, while a prediction-guided decoding path speculatively narrows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) search window and safely falls back to maintain bit-exactness. A multi-lane organization scales throughput and enables fine-grained clock gating for efficient scheduling. On image workloads, our RTL-simulated prototype achieves 121.2x encode and 70.9x decode speedups over a Python rANS baseline, reducing average decoder binary-search steps from 7.00 to 3.15 (approximately 55% fewer). When paired with neural probability models, RAS sustains higher compression ratios than classical codecs and outperforms CPU/GPU rANS implementations, offering a practical approach to fast neural lossless compression."
2511.04687,"Zoned Namespace (ZNS) SSDs offer a promising interface for stable throughput and low-latency storage by eliminating device-side garbage collection. They expose storage as append-only zones that give the host applications direct control over data placement. However, current ZNS implementations suffer from (a) device-level write amplification (DLWA), (b) increased wear, and (c) interference with host I/O due to zone mapping and management. We identify two primary design decisions as the main cause: (i) fixed physical zones and (ii) full-zone operations that lead to excessive physical writes. We propose SilentZNS, a new zone mapping and management approach that addresses the aforementioned limitations by on-the-fly allocating available resources to zones, while minimizing wear, maintaining parallelism, and avoiding unnecessary writes at the device-level. SilentZNS is a flexible zone allocation scheme that departs from the traditional logical-to-physical zone mapping and allows for arbitrary collections of blocks to be assigned to a zone. We add the necessary constraints to ensure wear-leveling and state-of-the-art read performance, and use only the required blocks to avoid dummy writes during zone reset. We implement SilentZNS using the state-of-the-art ConfZNS++ emulator and show that it eliminates the undue burden of dummy writes by up to 20x, leading to lower DLWA (86% less at 10% zone occupancy), less overall wear (up to 76.9%), and up to 3.7x faster workload execution."
2511.04713,"As dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and other current transistor-based memories approach their scalability limits, the search for alternative storage methods becomes increasingly urgent. Phase-change memory (PCM) emerges as a promising candidate due to its scalability, fast access time, and zero leakage power compared to many existing memory technologies. However, PCM has significant drawbacks that currently hinder its viability as a replacement. PCM cells suffer from a limited lifespan because write operations degrade the physical material, and these operations consume a considerable amount of energy. For PCM to be a practical option for data storage-which involves frequent write operations-its cell endurance must be enhanced, and write energy must be reduced. In this paper, we propose SMART-WRITE, a method that integrates neural networks (NN) and reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically optimize write energy and improve performance. The NN model monitors real-time operating conditions and device characteristics to determine optimal write parameters, while the RL model dynamically adjusts these parameters to further optimize PCM's energy consumption. By continuously adjusting PCM write parameters based on real-time system conditions, SMART-WRITE reduces write energy consumption by up to 63% and improves performance by up to 51% compared to the baseline and previous models."
2511.04798,"Manhattan Distance Mapping (MDM) is a post-training deep neural network (DNN) weight mapping technique for memristive bit-sliced compute-in-memory (CIM) crossbars that reduces parasitic resistance (PR) nonidealities.PR limits crossbar efficiency by mapping DNN matrices into small crossbar tiles, reducing CIM-based speedup. Each crossbar executes one tile, requiring digital synchronization before the next layer. At this granularity, designers either deploy many small crossbars in parallel or reuse a few sequentially-both increasing analog-to-digital conversions, latency, I/O pressure, and chip area.MDM alleviates PR effects by optimizing active-memristor placement. Exploiting bit-level structured sparsity, it feeds activations from the denser low-order side and reorders rows according to the Manhattan distance, relocating active cells toward regions less affected by PR and thus lowering the nonideality factor (NF).Applied to DNN models on ImageNet-1k, MDM reduces NF by up to 46% and improves accuracy under analog distortion by an average of 3.6% in ResNets. Overall, it provides a lightweight, spatially informed method for scaling CIM DNN accelerators."
2511.05321,"Real-time systems, particularly those used in domains like automated driving, are increasingly adopting neural networks. From this trend arises the need for high-performance hardware exhibiting predictable timing behavior. While state-of-the-art real-time hardware often suffers from limited memory and compute resources, modern AI accelerators typically lack the crucial predictability due to memory interference.We present a new hardware architecture to bridge this gap between performance and predictability. The architecture features a multi-core vector processor with predictable cores, each equipped with local scratchpad memories. A central management core orchestrates access to shared external memory following a statically determined schedule.To evaluate the proposed hardware architecture, we analyze different variants of our parameterized design. We compare these variants to a baseline architecture consisting of a single-core vector processor with large vector registers. We find that configurations with a larger number of smaller cores achieve better performance due to increased effective memory bandwidth and higher clock frequencies. Crucially for real-time systems, execution time fluctuation remains very low, demonstrating the platform's time predictability."
2511.05502,"We present a systematic, empirical evaluation of five local large language model (LLM) runtimes on Apple Silicon: MLX, MLC-LLM,this http URL, Ollama, and PyTorch MPS. Experiments were conducted on a Mac Studio equipped with an M2 Ultra processor and 192 GB of unified memory. Using the Qwen-2.5 model family across prompts ranging from a few hundred to 100,000 tokens, we measure time-to-first-token (TTFT), steady-state throughput, latency percentiles, long-context behavior (key-value and prompt caching), quantization support, streaming performance, batching and concurrency behavior, and deployment complexity.Under our settings, MLX achieves the highest sustained generation throughput, while MLC-LLM delivers consistently lower TTFT for moderate prompt sizes and offers stronger out-of-the-box inference features.this http URLis highly efficient for lightweight single-stream use, Ollama emphasizes developer ergonomics but lags in throughput and TTFT, and PyTorch MPS remains limited by memory constraints on large models and long contexts.All frameworks execute fully on-device with no telemetry, ensuring strong privacy guarantees. We release scripts, logs, and plots to reproduce all results. Our analysis clarifies the design trade-offs in Apple-centric LLM deployments and provides evidence-based recommendations for interactive and long-context processing. Although Apple Silicon inference frameworks still trail NVIDIA GPU-based systems such as vLLM in absolute performance, they are rapidly maturing into viable, production-grade solutions for private, on-device LLM inference."

Dense hyperdimensional computing (HDC) proves to be efficient over neural networks; however, it still consumes considerable switching power for an ultra-low energy application. Sparse HDC, on the other hand, has the potential of further reducing the energy consumption, yet at the expense of having to support more complex operations and introducing an extra hyperparameter, the maximum hypervector density. To improve the energy and area efficiency of the sparse HDC operations, this work introduces the compressed item memory (CompIM) and simplifies the spatial bundling. We also analyze how a proper hyperparameter choice improves the detection delay compared to dense HDC. Ultimately, our optimizations achieve a 1.73x more energy- and 2.20x more area-efficient hardware design than the naive sparse implementation. We are also 7.50x more energy- and 3.24x more area-efficient than the dense HDC implementation.

2511.05583,"We present a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) implemented on a 16 nm Xilinx UltraScale Plus FPGA that achieves a resolution of 1.15 ps, RMS precision of 3.38 ps, a differential nonlinearity (DNL) of [-0.43, 0.24] LSB, and an integral nonlinearity (INL) of [-2.67, 0.15] LSB. This work introduces two novel hardware-independent post-processing techniques - Partial Order Reconstruction (POR) and Iterative Time-bin Interleaving (ITI) - that significantly enhance the performance of FPGA-based TDCs. POR addresses the missing code problem by inferring the partial order of each time bin through code density test data and directed acyclic graph (DAG) analysis, enabling near-complete recovery of usable bins. ITI further improves fine time resolution by merging multiple calibrated tapped delay lines (TDLs) into a single unified delay chain, achieving scalable resolution without resorting to averaging. Compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based TDC architectures, the proposed methods deliver competitive or superior performance with reduced hardware overhead. These techniques are broadly applicable to high-resolution time measurement and precise delay calibration in programmable logic platforms."

2511.06249,"Although NAND flash memory has achieved continuous capacity improvements via advanced 3D stacking and multi-level cell technologies, these innovations introduce new reliability challenges, par- ticularly lateral charge spreading (LCS), absent in low-capacity 2D flash memory. Since LCS significantly increases retention errors over time, addressing this problem is essential to ensure the lifetime of modern SSDs employing high-capacity 3D flash memory. In this paper, we propose a novel data randomizer, STate-Aware Randomizer (STAR), which proactively eliminates the majority of weak data patterns responsible for retention errors caused by LCS. Unlike existing techniques that target only specific worst-case patterns, STAR effectively removes a broad spectrum of weak patterns, significantly enhancing reliability against LCS. By employing several optimization schemes, STAR can be efficiently integrated into the existing I/O datapath of an SSD controller with negligible timing overhead. To evaluate the proposed STAR scheme, we developed a STAR-aware SSD emulator based on characterization results from 160 real 3D NAND flash chips. Experimental results demonstrate that STAR improves SSD lifetime by up to 2.3x and reduces read latency by an average of 50% on real-world traces compared to conventional SSDs"
2511.06313,"Emerging continual learning applications necessitate next-generation neural processing unit (NPU) platforms to support both training and inference operations. The promising Microscaling (MX) standard enables narrow bit-widths for inference and large dynamic ranges for training. However, existing MX multiply-accumulate (MAC) designs face a critical trade-off: integer accumulation requires expensive conversions from narrow floating-point products, while FP32 accumulation suffers from quantization losses and costly normalization. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid precision-scalable reduction tree for MX MACs that combines the benefits of both approaches, enabling efficient mixed-precision accumulation with controlled accuracy relaxation. Moreover, we integrate an 8x8 array of these MACs into the state-of-the-art (SotA) NPU integration platform, SNAX, to provide efficient control and data transfer to our optimized precision-scalable MX datapath. We evaluate our design both on MAC and system level and compare it to the SotA. Our integrated system achieves an energy efficiency of 657, 1438-1675, and 4065 GOPS/W, respectively, for MXINT8, MXFP8/6, and MXFP4, with a throughput of 64, 256, and 512 GOPS."

Next-generation NPUs, however, call for more flexible on-chip memory architectures that can support diverse access and management schemes required by embedding workloads. To enable flexible exploration and design of emerging NPU architectures, we present EONSim, an NPU simulator that holistically models both matrix and embedding vector operations. EONSim integrates a validated performance model for matrix computations with detailed memory simulation for embedding accesses, supporting various on-chip memory management policies. Validated against TPUv6e, EONSim achieves an average inference time error of 1.4\% and an average on-chip memory access count error of 2.2\%."
2511.06736,"Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have become essential in cloud computing due to their reconfigurability, energy efficiency, and ability to accelerate domain-specific workloads. As FPGA adoption grows, research into task scheduling and preemption techniques has intensified. However, the field lacks a standardized benchmarking framework for consistent and reproducible evaluation. Many existing studies propose innovative scheduling or preemption mechanisms but often rely on proprietary or synthetic benchmarks, limiting generalizability and making comparison difficult. This methodical fragmentation hinders effective evaluation of scheduling strategies and preemption in multi-tenant FPGA environments.This paper presents the first open-source preemption-enabled benchmark suite for evaluating FPGA preemption strategies and testing new scheduling algorithms, without requiring users to create preemption workloads from scratch. The suite includes 27 diverse applications spanning cryptography, AI/ML, computation-intensive workloads, communication systems, and multimedia processing. Each benchmark integrates comprehensive context-saving and restoration mechanisms, facilitating reproducible research and consistent comparisons. Our suite not only simplifies testing FPGA scheduling policies but also benefits OS research by enabling the evaluation of scheduling fairness, resource allocation efficiency, and context-switching performance in multi-tenant FPGA systems, ultimately supporting the development of better operating systems and scheduling policies for FPGA-based environments. We also provide guidelines for adding new benchmarks, enabling future research to expand and refine FPGA preemption and scheduling evaluation."
2511.0677,"The integration of spiking neural networks (SNNs) with transformer-based architectures has opened new opportunities for bio-inspired low-power, event-driven visual reasoning on edge devices. However, the high temporal resolution and binary nature of spike-driven computation introduce architectural mismatches with conventional digital hardware (CPU/GPU). Prior neuromorphic and Processing-in-Memory (PIM) accelerators struggle with high sparsity and complex operations prevalent in such models. To address these challenges, we propose a memory-centric hardware accelerator tailored for spiking transformers, optimized for deployment in real-time event-driven frameworks such as classification with both static and event-based input frames. Our design leverages a hybrid analog-digital PIM architecture with input sparsity optimizations, and a custom-designed dataflow to minimize memory access overhead and maximize data reuse under spatiotemporal sparsity, for compute and memory-efficient end-to-end execution of spiking transformers. We subsequently propose inference-time software optimizations for layer skipping, and timestep reduction, leveraging Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to perform robust, efficient co-exploration of the joint algorithmic-microarchitectural design spaces under tight computational budgets. Evaluated on both image(ImageNet) and event-based (CIFAR-10 DVS, DVSGesture) classification, the accelerator achieves up to ~467x and ~1.86x energy reduction compared to edge GPU (Jetson Orin Nano) and previous PIM accelerators for spiking transformers, while maintaining competitive task accuracy on ImageNet dataset. This work enables a new class of intelligent ubiquitous edge AI, built using spiking transformer acceleration for low-power, real-time visual processing at the extreme edge."
2511.06838,"The substantial memory bandwidth and computational demands of large language models (LLMs) present critical challenges for efficient inference. To tackle this, the literature has explored heterogeneous systems that combine neural processing units (NPUs) with DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) for LLM acceleration. However, existing high-precision (e.g., FP16) PIM compute units incur significant area and power overhead in DRAM technology, limiting the effective computation throughput. In this paper, we introduce P3-LLM, a novel NPU-PIM integrated accelerator for LLM inference using hybrid numerical formats. Our approach is threefold: First, we propose a flexible mixed-precision quantization scheme, which leverages hybrid numerical formats to quantize different LLM operands with high compression efficiency and minimal accuracy loss. Second, we architect an efficient PIM accelerator for P3-LLM, featuring enhanced compute units to support hybrid numerical formats. Our careful choice of numerical formats allows to co-design low-precision PIM compute units that significantly boost the computation throughput under iso-area constraints. Third, we optimize the low-precision dataflow of different LLM modules by applying operator fusion to minimize the overhead of runtime dequantization. Evaluation on a diverse set of representative LLMs and tasks demonstrates that P3-LLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in terms of both KV-cache quantization and weight-activation quantization. Combining the proposed quantization scheme with PIM architecture co-design, P3-LLM yields an average of $4.9\times$, $2.0\times$, and $3.4\times$ speedups over the state-of-the-art LLM accelerators HBM-PIM, Ecco, and Pimba, respectively.

2511.06907,"General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is a fundamental operation in many scientific workloads, signal processing, and particularly deep learning. It is often a bottleneck for performance and energy efficiency, especially in edge environments with tight resource and power constraints. AMD's Versal ACAP offers heterogeneous components (AIEs, PL, PS) that can address these challenges, but mapping GEMM across them is complex, with prior works largely overlooking energy-performance trade-offs. In this paper, we propose an automated framework for Versal ACAP that generates GEMM mappings optimized for either performance or energy efficiency. Unlike prior analytical approaches, our method leverages a Machine Learning (ML) model, trained on approximately 6000 on-board experiments of different GEMM mappings, to guide Design Space Exploration, yielding more efficient designs. Evaluation on the Versal VCK190 shows geomean improvements of 1.23x (up to 2.5x) in throughput and 1.25x (up to 2.7x) in energy efficiency over state-of-the-art frameworks."
2511.06955,"Edge AI deployment faces critical challenges balancing computational performance, energy efficiency, and resource constraints. This paper presents FPGA-accelerated RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) extensions for efficient neural network inference on resource-constrained edge devices. We introduce a custom RISC-V core with four novel ISA extensions (this http URL,this http URL,this http URL,this http URL) and integrated neural network accelerators, implemented and validated on the Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 platform. The complete system achieves 2.14x average latency speedup and 49.1% energy reduction versus an ARM Cortex-A9 software baseline across four benchmark models (MobileNet V2, ResNet-18, EfficientNet Lite, YOLO Tiny). Hardware implementation closes timing with +12.793 ns worst negative slack at 50 MHz while using 0.43% LUTs and 11.4% BRAM for the base core and 38.8% DSPs when accelerators are active. Hardware verification confirms successful FPGA deployment with verified 64 KB BRAM memory interface and AXI interconnect functionality. All performance metrics are obtained from physical hardware measurements. This work establishes a reproducible framework for ISA-guided FPGA acceleration that complements fixed-function ASICs by trading peak performance for programmability."
