2501.00855,"Chatter on social media is 20% bots and 80% humans. Chatter by bots and humans is consistently different: bots tend to use linguistic cues that can be easily automated while humans use cues that require dialogue understanding. Bots use words that match the identities they choose to present, while humans may send messages that are not related to the identities they present. Bots and humans differ in their communication structure: sampled bots have a star interaction structure, while sampled humans have a hierarchical structure. These conclusions are based on a large-scale analysis of social media tweets across ~200mil users across 7 events. Social media bots took the world by storm when social-cybersecurity researchers realized that social media users not only consisted of humans but also of artificial agents called bots. These bots wreck havoc online by spreading disinformation and manipulating narratives. Most research on bots are based on special-purposed definitions, mostly predicated on the event studied. This article first begins by asking, ""What is a bot?"", and we study the underlying principles of how bots are different from humans. We develop a first-principle definition of a social media bot. With this definition as a premise, we systematically compare characteristics between bots and humans across global events, and reflect on how the software-programmed bot is an Artificial Intelligent algorithm, and its potential for evolution as technology advances. Based on our results, we provide recommendations for the use and regulation of bots. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions: Detect, to systematically identify these automated and potentially evolving bots; Differentiate, to evaluate the goodness of the bot in terms of their content postings and relationship interactions; Disrupt, to moderate the impact of malicious bots."
2501.00939,"The Web has drastically simplified our access to knowledge and learning, and fact-checking online resources has become a part of our daily routine. Studying online knowledge consumption is thus critical for understanding human behavior and informing the design of future platforms. In this Chapter, we approach this subject by describing the navigation patterns of the readers of Wikipedia, the world's largest platform for open knowledge. We provide a comprehensive overview of what is known about the three steps that characterize navigation on Wikipedia: (1) how readers reach the platform, (2) how readers navigate the platform, and (3) how readers leave the platform. Finally, we discuss open problems and opportunities for future research in this field."
2501.00957,"The rise of Generative AI (GAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed industrial landscapes, offering unprecedented opportunities for efficiency and innovation while raising critical ethical, regulatory, and operational challenges. This study conducts a text-based analysis of 160 guidelines and policy statements across fourteen industrial sectors, utilizing systematic methods and text-mining techniques to evaluate the governance of these technologies. By examining global directives, industry practices, and sector-specific policies, the paper highlights the complexities of balancing innovation with ethical accountability and equitable access. The findings provide actionable insights and recommendations for fostering responsible, transparent, and safe integration of GAI and LLMs in diverse industry contexts."
2501.00959,"This paper introduces IGGA, a dataset of 160 industry guidelines and policy statements for the use of Generative AIs (GAIs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in industry and workplace settings, collected from official company websites, and trustworthy news sources. The dataset contains 104,565 words and serves as a valuable resource for natural language processing tasks commonly applied in requirements engineering, such as model synthesis, abstraction identification, and document structure assessment. Additionally, IGGA can be further annotated to function as a benchmark for various tasks, including ambiguity detection, requirements categorization, and the identification of equivalent requirements. Our methodologically rigorous approach ensured a thorough examination, with a selection of reputable and influential companies that represent a diverse range of global institutions across six continents. The dataset captures perspectives from fourteen industry sectors, including technology, finance, and both public and private institutions, offering a broad spectrum of insights into the integration of GAIs and LLMs in industry."
2501.00964,"Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) are transforming multiple aspects of society, including education and foreign language learning. In the context of English as a Foreign Language (EFL), significant research has been conducted to investigate the applicability of GenAI as a learning aid and the potential negative impacts of new technologies. Critical questions remain about the future of AI, including whether improvements will continue at such a pace or stall and whether there is a true benefit to implementing GenAI in education, given the myriad costs and potential for negative impacts.Apart from the ethical conundrums that GenAI presents in EFL education, there is growing consensus that learners and teachers must develop AI literacy skills to enable them to use and critically evaluate the purposes and outputs of these technologies. However, there are few formalised frameworks available to support the integration and development of AI literacy skills for EFL learners. In this article, we demonstrate how the use of a general, all-purposes framework (the AI Assessment Scale) can be tailored to the EFL writing and translation context, drawing on existing empirical research validating the scale and adaptations to other contexts, such as English for Academic Purposes. We begin by engaging with the literature regarding GenAI and EFL writing and translation, prior to explicating the use of three levels of the updated AIAS for structuring EFL writing instruction which promotes academic literacy and transparency and provides a clear framework for students and teachers."
2501.01128,"Winter road maintenance is a critical priority for the Indiana Department of Transportation, which manages an extensive fleet across thousands of lane miles. The current manual tracking of snowplow workloads is inefficient and prone to errors. To address these challenges, we developed an in-browser web application that automates the creation and verification of work orders using a large-scale GPS dataset from telematics systems. The application processes millions of GPS data points from hundreds of vehicles over winter, significantly reducing manual labor and minimizing errors. Key features include geohashing for efficient road segment identification, detailed segment-level work records, and robust visualization of vehicle movements, even on repeated routes. Our proposed solution has the potential to enhance the accuracy and granularity of work records, support more effective resource allocation, ensure timely compensation for drivers, alleviate administrative burdens, and allow managers to focus on strategic planning and real-time challenges. The web application can be accessed atthis https URL"
2501.0135,"Non-invasive mobile wearables like fitness trackers, smartwatches and rings allow for an easier and relatively less expensive approach to study everyday human behaviour when compared to traditional longitudinal methods. Here we have utilised smart rings manufactured by Oura to obtain granular data from nineteen healthy participants over the time span of one year (October 2023 - September 2024) along with monthly surveys for nine months to track their subjective stress during the study. We have investigated longitudinal sleep and activity patterns of three chronotype groups of participating individuals: morning type (MT), neither type (NT) and evening type (ET). We find that while ET individuals do not seem to lead as healthy life as the MT or NT individuals in terms of overall sleep and activity, they seem to have significantly improved their habits during the duration of the study. The activity in all chronotype groups varies across the year with ET showing an increasing trend. Furthermore, we also show that the Daylight Saving Time changes affect the MT and ET chronotypes, oppositely. Finally, using a mixed-effects regression model, we show that an individual's perceived stress is significantly associated with their time spent in bed during the night time sleep, monthly survey response time, and chronotype, while accounting for individual variability."
2501.01639,"The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is revolutionizing medical diagnostics, personalized medicine, and operational efficiency. However, alongside these advancements, significant challenges arise concerning patient data privacy, ethical considerations, and regulatory compliance. This paper examines the dual impact of AI on healthcare, highlighting its transformative potential and the critical need for safeguarding sensitive health information. It explores the role of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) as a regulatory framework for ensuring data privacy and security, emphasizing the importance of robust safeguards and ethical standards in AI-driven healthcare. Through case studies, including AI applications in diabetic retinopathy, oncology, and the controversies surrounding data sharing, this study underscores the ethical and legal complexities of AI implementation. A balanced approach that fosters innovation while maintaining patient trust and privacy is imperative. The findings emphasize the importance of continuous education, transparency, and adherence to regulatory frameworks to harness AI's full potential responsibly and ethically in healthcare."
2501.01738,"The rise of digital platforms has transformed political campaigning, introducing complex regulatory challenges. This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy for analyzing political content in the EU's digital electoral landscape, aligning with the requirements set forth in new regulations, such as the Digital Services Act. Using a legal doctrinal methodology, we construct a detailed codebook that enables systematic content analysis across user-generated and political ad content to assess compliance with regulatory mandates."
2501.01779,"Regular exercise is widely recognized as a cornerstone of health, yet sustaining consistent exercise habits remains challenging. Understanding the factors that influence the formation of these habits is crucial for developing effective interventions. This study utilizes data from Mars Athletic Club, Türkiye's largest sports chain, to investigate the dynamics of gym attendance and habit formation. The general problem addressed by this study is identifying the critical periods and factors that contribute to the successful establishment of consistent exercise routines among gym-goers. We show that specific periods of attendance are most crucial for habit formation. By developing a survival metric based on gym attendance patterns, we pinpoint these key phases and segment members into distinct clusters based on their visit patterns. Our analysis reveals significant differences in how various subgroups respond to interventions, such as group classes, personal trainer sessions, and visiting different clubs. Using causal inference analysis, we demonstrate that personalized guidance and social dynamics are key drivers of sustained long-term engagement. By systematically examining these variables and considering the specific characteristics of different clusters, our research highlights the importance of a tailored, multi-dimensional approach to promoting exercise habits, which integrates social dynamics, personalized guidance, and strategic interventions to sustain long-term engagement."
2501.01958,"Diet plays a crucial role in managing chronic conditions and overall well-being. As people become more selective about their food choices, finding recipes that meet dietary needs is important. Ingredient substitution is key to adapting recipes for dietary restrictions, allergies, and availability constraints. However, identifying suitable substitutions is challenging as it requires analyzing the flavor, functionality, and health suitability of ingredients. With the advancement of AI, researchers have explored computational approaches to address ingredient substitution. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the research in this area, focusing on five key aspects: (i) datasets and data sources used to support ingredient substitution research; (ii) techniques and approaches applied to solve substitution problems (iii) contextual information of ingredients considered, such as nutritional content, flavor, and pairing potential; (iv) applications for which substitution models have been developed, including dietary restrictions, constraints, and missing ingredients; (v) safety and transparency of substitution models, focusing on user trust and health concerns. The survey also highlights promising directions for future research, such as integrating neuro-symbolic techniques for deep learning and utilizing knowledge graphs for improved reasoning, aiming to guide advancements in food computation and ingredient substitution."
2501.02074,"Societal stereotypes are at the center of a myriad of responsible AI interventions targeted at reducing the generation and propagation of potentially harmful outcomes. While these efforts are much needed, they tend to be fragmented and often address different parts of the issue without adopting a unified or holistic approach to social stereotypes and how they impact various parts of the machine learning pipeline. As a result, current interventions fail to capitalize on the underlying mechanisms that are common across different types of stereotypes, and to anchor on particular aspects that are relevant in certain cases. In this paper, we draw on social psychological research and build on NLP data and methods, to propose a unified framework to operationalize stereotypes in generative AI evaluations. Our framework identifies key components of stereotypes that are crucial in AI evaluation, including the target group, associated attribute, relationship characteristics, perceiving group, and context. We also provide considerations and recommendations for its responsible use."
2501.02132,"The convergence of humans and artificial intelligence systems introduces new dynamics into the cultural and intellectual landscape. Complementing emerging cultural evolution concepts such as machine culture, AI agents represent a significant techno-sociological development, particularly within the anthropological study of Web3 as a community focused on decentralization through blockchain. Despite their growing presence, the cultural significance of AI agents remains largely unexplored in academic literature. Toward this end, we conceived hybrid netnography, a novel interdisciplinary approach that examines the cultural and intellectual dynamics within digital ecosystems by analyzing the interactions and contributions of both human and AI agents as co-participants in shaping narratives, ideas, and cultural artifacts. We argue that, within the Web3 community on the social media platform X, these agents challenge traditional notions of participation and influence in public discourse, creating a hybrid marketplace of ideas, a conceptual space where human and AI generated ideas coexist and compete for attention. We examine the current state of AI agents in idea generation, propagation, and engagement, positioning their role as cultural agents through the lens of memetics and encouraging further inquiry into their cultural and societal impact. Additionally, we address the implications of this paradigm for privacy, intellectual property, and governance, highlighting the societal and legal challenges of integrating AI agents into the hybrid marketplace of ideas."
2501.02169,"Verisign reported a 125 percent increase in data breaches within the healthcare sector in the United States during 2022, with 18.2 million patient records being impacted. Growing healthcare data volumes and diversification mean that medical information is becoming more valuable. Many Health Centers use various technologies to ease the classification, storage, and exchange of big data. This use can also make the health data of the users at risk and vulnerable. AI and blockchain are among the leading technologies at hand. With AI, data-driven operations and big data efficiency have been improved with respect to traditional techniques. Due to its potential to bring about improvements in health services and lower medical costs, this AI technology is regularly used in healthcare. Blockchain helps protect transactions on sharing information and private privacy as long as the exchange of knowledge is that of the standard. The objective of this analysis is to investigate the research and unique contributions since 2008 regarding blockchain-integrated AI and healthcare systems. The work sheds light on applied AI-based healthcare schemes with machine, ballistic, and acrylic learning and disparate blockchain structures. The use of technology in order to ensure patient data security and manage medical information effectively in healthcare settings offers a highly successful position for both healthcare providers and patients. From 2018 to 2021, the best year was 2021 to grow, enhancing everything to examine the download of the device and the counting of Google Academies, for which the joining perspective was borrowed; local research experts were asked, identified articles in recent years, and read reviews of large research grants."
2501.02321,"Artificial intelligence has achieved notable results in sign language recognition and translation. However, relatively few efforts have been made to significantly improve the quality of life for the 72 million hearing-impaired people worldwide. Sign language translation models, relying on video inputs, involves with large parameter sizes, making it time-consuming and computationally intensive to be deployed. This directly contributes to the scarcity of human-centered technology in this field. Additionally, the lack of datasets in sign language translation hampers research progress in this area. To address these, we first propose a cross-modal multi-knowledge distillation technique from 3D to 1D and a novel end-to-end pre-training text correction framework. Compared to other pre-trained models, our framework achieves significant advancements in correcting text output errors. Our model achieves a decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) of at least 1.4% on PHOENIX14 and PHOENIX14T datasets compared to the state-of-the-art CorrNet. Additionally, the TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) quantized model size is reduced to 12.93 MB, making it the smallest, fastest, and most accurate model to date. We have also collected and released extensive Chinese sign language datasets, and developed a specialized training vocabulary. To address the lack of research on data augmentation for landmark data, we have designed comparative experiments on various augmentation methods. Moreover, we performed a simulated deployment and prediction of our model on Intel platform CPUs and assessed the feasibility of deploying the model on other platforms."
2501.02418,"Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, employees from around the world were compelled to work remotely from home and, in many cases, without much preparation. A substantial body of international research has been conducted on the experiences and attitudes of remote workers as well as the implications of this phenomenon for organisations. While New Zealand research evidence is growing, most existing inquiry is qualitative. This paper provides a quantitative snapshot of remote working using survey data from participants whose jobs can be done from home (n=415). Data collection took place when the country was facing Covid-related measures.Based on descriptive and inferential statistics, it was found that, not only was remote working common, but that hybrid working arrangements were also more prevalent. While half of the participants wanted to work from home more frequently, age, but not gender, was significantly associated with this preference. Another relevant finding is that perceived change in the workplace culture due to flexible work arrangements was significantly associated with preference for working remotely more often. Finally, the most common perceived barriers to working from home were slow internet speed, the need to attend face-to-face meetings, and limited space at home to work. The implications of the results are discussed and some directions for future research are proposed."
2501.02531,"As general-purpose artificial intelligence systems become increasingly integrated into society and are used for information seeking, content generation, problem solving, textual analysis, coding, and running processes, it is crucial to assess their long-term impact on humans. This research explores the sentiment of large language models (LLMs) and humans toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) using a Likert-scale survey. Seven LLMs, including GPT-4 and Bard, were analyzed and compared with sentiment data from three independent human sample populations. Temporal variations in sentiment were also evaluated over three consecutive days. The results show a diversity in sentiment scores among LLMs, ranging from 3.32 to 4.12 out of 5. GPT-4 recorded the most positive sentiment toward AGI, while Bard leaned toward a neutral sentiment. In contrast, the human samples showed a lower average sentiment of 2.97. The analysis outlines potential conflicts of interest and biases in the sentiment formation of LLMs, and indicates that LLMs could subtly influence societal perceptions. To address the need for regulatory oversight and culturally grounded assessments of AI systems, we introduce the Societal AI Alignment and Sentiment Benchmark (SAAS-AI), which leverages multidimensional prompts and empirically validated societal value frameworks to evaluate language model outputs across temporal, model, and multilingual axes. This benchmark is designed to guide policymakers and AI agencies, including within frameworks such as the EU AI Act, by providing robust, actionable insights into AI alignment with human values, public sentiment, and ethical norms at both national and international levels. Future research should further refine the operationalization of the SAAS-AI benchmark and systematically evaluate its effectiveness through comprehensive empirical testing."
2501.0256,"Advances in IoT technologies combined with new algorithms have enabled the collection and processing of high-rate multi-source data streams that quantify human behavior in a fine-grained level and can lead to deeper insights on individual behaviors as well as on the interplay between behaviors and the environment. In this paper, we present an integrated system that collects and extracts multiple behavioral and environmental indicators, aiming at improving public health policies for tackling obesity. Data collection takes place using passive methods based on smartphone and smartwatch applications that require minimal interaction with the user. Our goal is to present a detailed account of the design principles, the implementation processes, and the evaluation of integrated algorithms, especially given the challenges we faced, in particular (a) integrating multiple technologies, algorithms, and components under a single, unified system, and (b) large scale (big data) requirements. We also present evaluation results of the algorithms on datasets (public for most cases) such as an absolute error of 8-9 steps when counting steps, 0.86 F1-score for detecting visited locations, and an error of less than 12 mins for gross sleep time. Finally, we also briefly present studies that have been materialized using our system, thus demonstrating its potential value to public authorities and individual researchers."
2501.03026,"Making sense of theory choice in normal and across extraordinary science is central to philosophy of science. The emergence of machine learning models has the potential to act as a wrench in the gears of current debates. In this paper, I will attempt to reconstruct the main movements that lead to and came out of Putnam's critical and explanatory tendency distinction, argue for the biconditional necessity of the tendencies, and conceptualize that wrench through a machine learning interpretation of my claim."
2501.03092,"AI is transforming human labor at an unprecedented pace - improving 10$\times$ per year in training effectiveness. This paper analyzes how society can adapt to AI-driven human-labor automation (HLA), using Bernardi et al.'s societal adaptation framework. Drawing on literature from general automation economics and recent AI developments, the paper develops a ""threat model."" The threat model is centered on mass unemployment and its socioeconomic consequences, and assumes a non-binary scenario between full AGI takeover and swift job creation. The analysis explores both ""capability-modifying interventions"" (CMIs) that shape how AI develops, and ""adaptation interventions"" (ADIs) that help society adjust. Key interventions analyzed include steering AI development toward human-complementing capabilities, implementing human-in-the-loop requirements, taxation of automation, comprehensive reorientation of education, and both material and social substitutes for work. While CMIs can slow the transition in the short-term, significant automation is inevitable. Long-term adaptation requires ADIs - from education reform to providing substitutes for both the income and psychological benefits of work. Success depends on upfront preparation through mechanisms like ""if-then commitments"", and crafting flexible and accurate regulation that avoids misspecification. This structured analysis of HLA interventions and their potential effects and challenges aims to guide holistic AI governance strategies for the AI economy."
2501.03097,"The abundance of information sources in our digital environment makes it difficult to study how such information shapes individuals' support for current policies. Our study with 791 German participants investigates self-directed online search in a naturalistic setting through three randomized controlled experiments on three topical policy issues: basic child support, renewable energy transition, and cannabis legalization. Participants' online browsing was passively tracked. Significant attitude shifts were observed for child support and cannabis legalization, but not for renewable energy transition. By encouraging participants to seek online information, this study enhances ecological validity compared to traditional experiments that expose subjects to predetermined content. Our experimental approach lays the groundwork for future research to advance understanding of media effects within the dynamic online information landscape."
2501.03098,"A new Digital Europe Programme (DEP), a funding instrument for development and innovation, was established in the European Union (EU) in 2021. The paper makes an empirical inquiry into the projects funded through the DEP. According to the results, the projects align well with the DEP's strategic focus on cyber security, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, innovation hubs, small- and medium-sized enterprises, and education. Most of the projects have received an equal amount of national and EU funding. Although national origins of participating organizations do not explain the amounts of funding granted, there is a rather strong tendency for national organizations to primarily collaborate with other national organizations. Finally, information about the technological domains addressed and the economic sectors involved provides decent explanatory power for statistically explaining the funding amounts granted. With these results and the accompanying discussion, the paper contributes to the timely debate about innovation, technology development, and industrial policy in Europe."
2501.03111,"This study investigates the impact of 19 external factors, related to weather, road traffic conditions, air quality, and time, on the occurrence of emergencies using historical data provided by the dispatch center of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV). This center is responsible for managing Emergency Medical Service (EMS) resources in the majority of the French-speaking part of Switzerland. First, classical statistical methods, such as correlation, Chi-squared test, Student's $t$-test, and information value, are employed to identify dependencies between the occurrence of emergencies and the considered parameters. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values and permutation importance are computed using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models. The results indicate that the hour of the day, along with correlated parameters, plays a crucial role in the occurrence of emergencies. Conversely, other factors do not significantly influence emergency occurrences. Subsequently, a simplified model that considers only the hour of the day is compared with our XGBoost and MLP models. These comparisons reveal no significant difference between the three models in terms of performance, supporting the use of the basic model in this context. These observations provide valuable insights for EMS resource relocation strategies, benefit predictive modeling efforts, and inform decision-making in the context of EMS. The implications extend to enhancing EMS quality, making this research essential."
2501.03556,"Amid the surge of intellectual property (IP) disputes surrounding non-fungible tokens (NFTs), some scholars have advocated for the application of personal property or sales law to regulate NFT minting and transactions, contending that IP laws unduly hinder the development of the NFT market. This Article counters these proposals and argues that the existing IP system stands as the most suitable regulatory framework for governing the evolving NFT market. Compared to personal property or sales law, IP laws can more effectively address challenges such as tragedies of the commons and anticommons in the NFT market. NFT communities have also developed their own norms and licensing agreements upon existing IP laws to regulate shared resources. Moreover, the IP regimes, with both static and dynamic institutional designs, can effectively balance various policy concerns, such as innovation, fair competition, and consumer protection, which alternative proposals struggle to provide."
2501.03611,"Social media platforms are popular among higher education students and have seen increased usage for academic purposes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, excessive use of social media can negatively impact students' academic performance. This preliminary study examines social media's impact on students' academic performance at Walter Sisulu University (WSU), Buffalo City campus. Using a positivist paradigm and a quantitative approach, randomly sampled data were collected from 71 students through a survey to identify trends and generate preliminary insights. Results indicate that while social media can facilitate academic work, it predominantly acts as a distraction, negatively affecting academic performance, particularly for first-year students. Notably, 84.5% of the students spend more than four hours daily on social media, and 39.4% agree that it negatively impacts their assignment completion. The study underscores the need for students to balance their social media use and academic responsibilities, highlighting the importance of this issue. Recommendations for achieving this balance, such as adopting time management strategies and integrating social media into teaching methodologies, are discussed."
2501.03928,"This study advances the field of conflict forecasting by using text-based actor embeddings with transformer models to predict dynamic changes in violent conflict patterns at the actor level. More specifically, we combine newswire texts with structured conflict event data and leverage recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to forecast escalations and de-escalations among conflicting actors, such as governments, militias, separatist movements, and terrorists. This new approach accurately and promptly captures the inherently volatile patterns of violent conflicts, which existing methods have not been able to achieve. To create this framework, we began by curating and annotating a vast international newswire corpus, leveraging hand-labeled event data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. By using this hybrid dataset, our models can incorporate the textual context of news sources along with the precision and detail of structured event data. This combination enables us to make both dynamic and granular predictions about conflict developments. We validate our approach through rigorous back-testing against historical events, demonstrating superior out-of-sample predictive power. We find that our approach is quite effective in identifying and predicting phases of conflict escalation and de-escalation, surpassing the capabilities of traditional models. By focusing on actor interactions, our explicit goal is to provide actionable insights to policymakers, humanitarian organizations, and peacekeeping operations in order to enable targeted and effective intervention strategies."
2501.03946,"Today, there is no clear legal test for regulating the use of variables that proxy for race and other protected classes and classifications. This Article develops such a test. Decision tools that use proxies are narrowly tailored when they exhibit the weakest total proxy power. The test is necessarily comparative. Thus, if two algorithms predict loan repayment or university academic performance with identical accuracy rates, but one uses zip code and the other does not, then the second algorithm can be said to have deployed a more equitable means for achieving the same result as the first algorithm. Scenarios in which two algorithms produce comparable and non-identical results present a greater challenge. This Article suggests that lawmakers can develop caps to permissible proxy power over time, as courts and algorithm builders learn more about the power of variables. Finally, the Article considers who should bear the burden of producing less discriminatory alternatives and suggests plaintiffs remain in the best position to keep defendants honest - so long as testing data is made available."
2501.03989,"In the digital age, the challenge of forgetfulness has emerged as a significant concern, particularly regarding the management of personal data and its accessibility online. The right to be forgotten (RTBF) allows individuals to request the removal of outdated or harmful information from public access, yet implementing this right poses substantial technical difficulties for search engines. This paper aims to introduce non-experts to the foundational concepts of information retrieval (IR) and de-indexing, which are critical for understanding how search engines can effectively ""forget"" certain content. We will explore various IR models, including boolean, probabilistic, vector space, and embedding-based approaches, as well as the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing data processing capabilities. By providing this overview, we seek to highlight the complexities involved in balancing individual privacy rights with the operational challenges faced by search engines in managing information visibility."
2501.04064,"Concerns about artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential existential risks have garnered significant attention, with figures like Geoffrey Hinton and Dennis Hassabis advocating for robust safeguards against catastrophic outcomes. Prominent scholars, such as Nick Bostrom and Max Tegmark, have further advanced the discourse by exploring the long-term impacts of superintelligent AI. However, this existential risk narrative faces criticism, particularly in popular media, where scholars like Timnit Gebru, Melanie Mitchell, and Nick Clegg argue, among other things, that it distracts from pressing current issues. Despite extensive media coverage, skepticism toward the existential risk discourse has received limited rigorous treatment in academic literature. Addressing this imbalance, this paper reconstructs and evaluates three common arguments against the existential risk perspective: the Distraction Argument, the Argument from Human Frailty, and the Checkpoints for Intervention Argument. By systematically reconstructing and assessing these arguments, the paper aims to provide a foundation for more balanced academic discourse and further research on AI."
2501.04438,"The aim of this study is to assess the impact of information technology (IT) on university graduates in terms of employment development, which will aid in economic issues. This study uses a descriptive research methodology and a quantitative approach to understand variables. The focus of this study is to ascertain how graduates of Kurdistan regional universities might use IT to secure employment and significantly contribute to the nation's economic revival. The sample size was established by the use of judgmental sampling procedure and consisted of 314 people. The researcher prepared the questionnaire to collect data, and then SPSS statistical software, version 22, and Excel 2010 were used to modify, compile, and tabulate the results. The study's outcome showed that information technology is incredibly inventive, has a promising future, and makes life much easier for everyone. It also proved that a deep academic understanding of information technology and its constituent parts helps graduates of Kurdistan Regional University find suitable careers. More importantly, though, anyone looking for work or a means of support will find great benefit from possessing credentials and understanding of IT. The study's final finding was that information technology has actively advanced the country's economy. Not only is IT helping to boost youth employment, but it is also turning into a worthwhile investment for economic growth."
2501.04763,"Search engines play an important role in the context of modern elections. By curating information in response to user queries, search engines influence how individuals are informed about election-related developments and perceive the media environment in which elections take place. It has particular implications for (perceived) polarization, especially if search engines' curation results in a skewed treatment of information sources based on their political leaning. Until now, however, it is unclear whether such a partisan gap emerges through information curation on search engines and what user- and system-side factors affect it. To address this shortcoming, we audit the two largest Western search engines, Google and Bing, prior to the 2024 US presidential elections and examine how these search engines' organic search results and additional interface elements represent election-related information depending on the queries' slant, user location, and time when the search was conducted. Our findings indicate that both search engines tend to prioritize left-leaning media sources, with the exact scope of search results' ideological slant varying between Democrat- and Republican-focused queries. We also observe limited effects of location- and time-based factors on organic search results, whereas results for additional interface elements were more volatile over time and specific US states. Together, our observations highlight that search engines' information curation actively mirrors the partisan divides present in the US media environments and has the potential to contribute to (perceived) polarization within these environments."
2501.04902,"Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have generated widespread enthusiasm for the potential of AI to support our understanding and protection of the environment. As such tools move from basic research to more consequential settings, such as regulatory enforcement, the human context of how AI is utilized, interpreted, and deployed becomes increasingly critical. Yet little work has systematically examined the role of such organizational goals and incentives in deploying AI systems. We report results from a unique case study of a satellite imagery-based AI tool to detect dumping of agricultural waste, with concurrent field trials with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) and a non-governmental environmental interest group in which the tool was utilized for field investigations when dumping was presumptively illegal in February-March 2023. Our results are threefold: First, both organizations confirmed a similar level of ground-truth accuracy for the model's detections. Second, they differed, however, in their overall assessment of its usefulness, as WDNR was interested in clear violations of existing law, while the interest group sought to document environmental risk beyond the scope of existing regulation. Dumping by an unpermitted entity or just before February 1, for instance, were deemed irrelevant by WDNR. Third, while AI tools promise to prioritize allocation of environmental protection resources, they may expose important gaps of existing law."
2501.0522,"The development of Automatic Question Generation (QG) models has the potential to significantly improve educational practices by reducing the teacher workload associated with creating educational content. This paper introduces a novel approach to educational question generation that controls the topical focus of questions. The proposed Topic-Controlled Question Generation (T-CQG) method enhances the relevance and effectiveness of the generated content for educational purposes. Our approach uses fine-tuning on a pre-trained T5-small model, employing specially created datasets tailored to educational needs. The research further explores the impacts of pre-training strategies, quantisation, and data augmentation on the model's performance. We specifically address the challenge of generating semantically aligned questions with paragraph-level contexts, thereby improving the topic specificity of the generated questions. In addition, we introduce and explore novel evaluation methods to assess the topical relatedness of the generated questions. Our results, validated through rigorous offline and human-backed evaluations, demonstrate that the proposed models effectively generate high-quality, topic-focused questions. These models have the potential to reduce teacher workload and support personalised tutoring systems by serving as bespoke question generators. With its relatively small number of parameters, the proposals not only advance the capabilities of question generation models for handling specific educational topics but also offer a scalable solution that reduces infrastructure costs. This scalability makes them feasible for widespread use in education without reliance on proprietary large language models like ChatGPT."
2501.0528,"Involving people in energy systems planning can increase the legitimacy and socio-political feasibility of energy transitions. Participatory research in energy modelling offers the opportunity to engage with stakeholders in a comprehensive way, but is limited by how results can be generated and presented without imposing assumptions and discrete scenarios on the participants. To this end, we present a methodology and a framework, based on near-optimal modelling results, that can incorporate stakeholders in a holistic and engaging way. We confront stakeholders with a continuum of modelling-based energy system designs via an interactive interface allowing them to choose essentially any combination of components that meet the system requirements. Together with information on the implications of different technologies, it is possible to assess how participants prioritise different aspects in energy systems planning while also facilitating learning in an engaging and stimulating way. We showcase the methodology for the remote Arctic settlement of Longyearbyen and illustrate how participants deviate consistently from the cost optimum. At the same time, they manage to balance different priorities such as emissions, costs, and system vulnerability leading to a better understanding of the complexity and intertwined nature of decisions."
2501.05325,"Explainable AI (XAI) provides methods to understand non-interpretable machine learning models. However, we have little knowledge about what legal experts expect from these explanations, including their legal compliance with, and value against European Union legislation. To close this gap, we present the Explanation Dialogues, an expert focus study to uncover the expectations, reasoning, and understanding of legal experts and practitioners towards XAI, with a specific focus on the European General Data Protection Regulation. The study consists of an online questionnaire and follow-up interviews, and is centered around a use-case in the credit domain. We extract both a set of hierarchical and interconnected codes using grounded theory, and present the standpoints of the participating experts towards XAI. We find that the presented explanations are hard to understand and lack information, and discuss issues that can arise from the different interests of the data controller and subject. Finally, we present a set of recommendations for developers of XAI methods, and indications of legal areas of discussion. Among others, recommendations address the presentation, choice, and content of an explanation, technical risks as well as the end-user, while we provide legal pointers to the contestability of explanations, transparency thresholds, intellectual property rights as well as the relationship between involved parties."
2501.05383,"The primary aim of this paper is to suggest questions for future discourse and research of specialized programming courses in the Humanities. Specifically I ask whether specialized courses promote the production of fragile programming knowledge, what are the difficulties encountered by humanistic students in their learning of programming, and what may be the proper place of algorithmics in the curriculum of specialized studies."
2501.05391,"Every maneuver of a vehicle redistributes risks between road users. While human drivers do this intuitively, autonomous vehicles allow and require deliberative algorithmic risk management. But how should traffic risks be distributed among road users? In a global experimental study in eight countries with different cultural backgrounds and almost 11,000 participants, we compared risk distribution preferences. It turns out that risk preferences in road traffic are strikingly similar between the cultural zones. The vast majority of participants in all countries deviates from a guiding principle of minimizing accident probabilities in favor of weighing up the probability and severity of accidents. At the national level, the consideration of accident probability and severity hardly differs between countries. The social dilemma of autonomous vehicles detected in deterministic crash scenarios disappears in risk assessments of everyday traffic situations in all countries. In no country do cyclists receive a risk bonus that goes beyond their higher vulnerability. In sum, our results suggest that a global consensus on the risk ethics of autonomous driving is easier to establish than on the ethics of crashing."
2501.05455,"Traditional safety engineering assesses systems in their context of use, e.g. the operational design domain (road layout, speed limits, weather, etc.) for self-driving vehicles (including those using AI). We refer to this as downstream safety. In contrast, work on safety of frontier AI, e.g. large language models which can be further trained for downstream tasks, typically considers factors that are beyond specific application contexts, such as the ability of the model to evade human control, or to produce harmful content, e.g. how to make bombs. We refer to this as upstream safety. We outline the characteristics of both upstream and downstream safety frameworks then explore the extent to which the broad AI safety community can benefit from synergies between these frameworks. For example, can concepts such as common mode failures from downstream safety be used to help assess the strength of AI guardrails? Further, can the understanding of the capabilities and limitations of frontier AI be used to inform downstream safety analysis, e.g. where LLMs are fine-tuned to calculate voyage plans for autonomous vessels? The paper identifies some promising avenues to explore and outlines some challenges in achieving synergy, or a confluence, between upstream and downstream safety frameworks."
2501.05461,"Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) significantly impacts individuals' daily lives and relationships. The conventional methods for SAD detection involve physical consultations and self-reported questionnaires, but they have limitations such as time consumption and bias. This paper introduces video analysis as a promising method for early SAD detection. Specifically, we present a new approach for detecting SAD in individuals from various bodily features extracted from the video data. We conducted a study to collect video data of 92 participants performing impromptu speech in a controlled environment. Using the video data, we studied the behavioral change in participants' head, body, eye gaze, and action units. By applying a range of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, we achieved an accuracy rate of up to 74\% in classifying participants as SAD or non-SAD. Video-based SAD detection offers a non-intrusive and scalable approach that can be deployed in real-time, potentially enhancing early detection and intervention capabilities."
2501.05595,"This entry provides an overview of Human-centered Geospatial Data Science, highlighting the gaps it aims to bridge, its significance, and its key topics and research. Geospatial Data Science, which derives geographic knowledge and insights from large volumes of geospatial big data using advanced Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI), has been widely used to tackle a wide range of geographic problems. However, it often overlooks the subjective human experiences that fundamentally influence human-environment interactions, and few strategies have been developed to ensure that these technologies follow ethical guidelines and prioritize human values. Human-centered Geospatial Data Science advocates for two primary focuses. First, it advances our understanding of human-environment interactions by leveraging Geospatial Data Science to measure and analyze human subjective experiences at place including emotion, perception, cognition, and creativity. Second, it advocates for the development of responsible and ethical Geospatial Data Science methods that protect geoprivacy, enhance fairness and reduce bias, and improve the explainability and transparency of geospatial technologies. With these two missions, Human-centered Geospatial Data Sciences brings a fresh perspective to develop and utilize geospatial technologies that positively impact society and benefit human well-being and the humanities."
2501.05617,"The use of AI in healthcare has the potential to improve patient care, optimize clinical workflows, and enhance decision-making. However, bias, data incompleteness, and inaccuracies in training datasets can lead to unfair outcomes and amplify existing disparities. This research investigates the current state of dataset documentation practices, focusing on their ability to address these challenges and support ethical AI development. We identify shortcomings in existing documentation methods, which limit the recognition and mitigation of bias, incompleteness, and other issues in datasets. We propose the 'Healthcare AI Datasheet' to address these gaps, a dataset documentation framework that promotes transparency and ensures alignment with regulatory requirements. Additionally, we demonstrate how it can be expressed in a machine-readable format, facilitating its integration with datasets and enabling automated risk assessments. The findings emphasise the importance of dataset documentation in fostering responsible AI development."
2501.05621,"As social media platforms are increasingly adopted, the data the data people leave behind is shining new light into our understanding of phenomena, ranging from socio-economic-political events to the spread of infectious diseases. This chapter presents research conducted in the past decade that has harnessed social media data in the service of mental health and well-being. The discussion is organized along three thrusts: a first that highlights how social media data has been utilized to detect and predict risk to varied mental health concerns; a second thrust that focuses on translation paradigms that can enable to use of such social media based algorithms in the real-world; and the final thrust that brings to the fore the ethical considerations and challenges that engender the conduct of this research as well as its translation. The chapter concludes by noting open questions and problems in this emergent area, emphasizing the need for deeper interdisciplinary collaborations and participatory research design, incorporating and centering on human agency, and attention to societal inequities and harms that may result from or be exacerbated in this line of computational social science research."
2501.05761,"Gerrymandering is a pervasive problem within the US political system. In the past decade, methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and statistical outlier tests have been proposed to quantify gerrymandering and were used as evidence in several high-profile legal cases. We perform an empirical power analysis of one such hypothesis test from Chikina et al (2020). We generate a family of biased North Carolina congressional district maps using the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections and assess under which conditions the outlier test fails to flag them at the specified Type I error level. The power of the outlier test is found to be relatively stable across political parties, election years, lengths of the MCMC chain and effect sizes. The main effect on the power of the test is shown to be the choice of the bias metric. This is the first work that computationally verifies the power of statistical tests used in gerrymandering cases."
2501.05921,"With the rapid pace of technological innovation, traditional methods of policy formation and legislating are becoming conspicuously anachronistic. The need for regulatory choices to be made to counter the deadening effect of regulatory lag is more important to developing markets and fostering growth than achieving one off regulatory perfection. This article advances scholarship on innovation policy and the regulation of technological innovation in the European Union. It does so by considering what building an agile yet robust anticipatory governance regulatory culture involves. It systematically excavates a variety of tools and elements that are being put into use in inventive ways and argues that these need to be more cohesively and systemically integrated into the regulatory toolbox. Approaches covered include strategic foresight, the critical embrace of iterative policy development and regulatory learning in the face of uncertainty and the embrace of bottom up approaches to cocreation of policy such as Policy Labs and the testing and regulatory learning through pilot regulation and experimentation. The growing use of regulatory sandboxes as an EU policy tool to boost innovation and navigate regulatory complexity as seen in the EU AI Act is also probed"
2501.06274,"The rise of misinformation and fake news in online political discourse poses significant challenges to democratic processes and public engagement. While debunking efforts aim to counteract misinformation and foster fact-based dialogue, these discussions often involve language toxicity and emotional polarization. We examined over 86 million debunking tweets and more than 4 million Reddit debunking comments to investigate the relationship between language toxicity, pessimism, and social polarization in debunking efforts. Focusing on discussions of the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections and the QAnon conspiracy theory, our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) peripheral participants (1-degree users) play a disproportionate role in shaping toxic discourse, driven by lower community accountability and emotional expression; (2) platform mechanisms significantly influence polarization, with Twitter amplifying partisan differences and Reddit fostering higher overall toxicity due to its structured, community-driven interactions; and (3) a negative correlation exists between language toxicity and pessimism, with increased interaction reducing toxicity, especially on Reddit. We show that platform architecture affects informational complexity of user interactions, with Twitter promoting concentrated, uniform discourse and Reddit encouraging diverse, complex communication. Our findings highlight the importance of user engagement patterns, platform dynamics, and emotional expressions in shaping polarization in debunking discourse. This study offers insights for policymakers and platform designers to mitigate harmful effects and promote healthier online discussions, with implications for understanding misinformation, hate speech, and political polarization in digital environments."
2501.06861,"The integration of AI systems into the military domain is changing the way war-related decisions are made. It binds together three disparate groups of actors - developers, integrators, users - and creates a relationship between these groups and the machine, embedded in the (pre-)existing organisational and system structures. In this article, we focus on the important, but often neglected, group of integrators within such a sociotechnical system. In complex human-machine configurations, integrators carry responsibility for linking the disparate groups of developers and users in the political and military system. To act as the mediating group requires a deep understanding of the other groups' activities, perspectives and norms. We thus ask which challenges and shortcomings emerge from integrating AI systems into resort-to-force (RTF) decision-making processes, and how to address them. To answer this, we proceed in three steps. First, we conceptualise the relationship between different groups of actors and AI systems as a sociotechnical system. Second, we identify challenges within such systems for human-machine teaming in RTF decisions. We focus on challenges that arise a) from the technology itself, b) from the integrators' role in the sociotechnical system, c) from the human-machine interaction. Third, we provide policy recommendations to address these shortcomings when integrating AI systems into RTF decision-making structures."
2501.06913,"Predictive analytics is widely used in learning analytics, but many resource-constrained institutions lack the capacity to develop their own models or rely on proprietary ones trained in different contexts with little transparency. Transfer learning holds promise for expanding equitable access to predictive analytics but remains underexplored due to legal and technical constraints. This paper examines transfer learning strategies for retention prediction at U.S. two-year community colleges. We envision a scenario where community colleges collaborate with each other and four-year universities to develop retention prediction models under privacy constraints and evaluate risks and improvement strategies of cross-institutional model transfer. Using administrative records from 4 research universities and 23 community colleges covering over 800,000 students across 7 cohorts, we identify performance and fairness degradation when external models are deployed locally without adaptation. Publicly available contextual information can forecast these performance drops and offer early guidance for model portability. For developers under privacy regulations, sequential training selecting institutions based on demographic similarities enhances fairness without compromising performance. For institutions lacking local data to fine-tune source models, customizing evaluation thresholds for sensitive groups outperforms standard transfer techniques in improving performance and fairness. Our findings suggest the value of transfer learning for more accessible educational predictive modeling and call for judicious use of contextual information in model training, selection, and deployment to achieve reliable and equitable model transfer."
2501.06929,"Today a four-year-old child who does not know how to read or write can now create bedtime stories with graphical illustrations and narrated audio, using AI tools that seamlessly transform speech into text, generate visuals, and convert text back into speech in a natural and engaging manner. This remarkable example demonstrates why we are living in the age of AI applications. This paper examines contemporary leading AI applications and traces their historical development, highlighting the major advancements that have enabled their realization. Five key factors are identified: 1) The evolution of computational hardware (CPUs and GPUs), enabling the training of complex AI models 2) The vast digital archives provided by the World Wide Web, which serve as a foundational data resource for AI systems 3) The ubiquity of mobile computing, with smartphones acting as powerful, accessible small computers in the hands of billions 4) The rise of industrial-scale cloud infrastructures, offering elastic computational power for AI training and deployment 5) Breakthroughs in AI research, including neural networks, backpropagation, and the ""Attention is All You Need"" framework, which underpin modern AI capabilities. These innovations have elevated AI from solving narrow tasks to enabling applications like ChatGPT that are adaptable for numerous use cases, redefining human-computer interaction. By situating these developments within a historical context, the paper highlights the critical milestones that have made AI's current capabilities both possible and widely accessible, offering profound implications for society."
2501.06981,"The global AI surge demands crowdworkers from diverse languages and cultures. They are pivotal in labeling data for enabling global AI systems. Despite global significance, research has primarily focused on understanding the perspectives and experiences of US and India crowdworkers, leaving a notable gap. To bridge this, we conducted a survey with 100 crowdworkers across 16 Latin American and Caribbean countries. We discovered that these workers exhibited pride and respect for their digital labor, with strong support and admiration from their families. Notably, crowd work was also seen as a stepping stone to financial and professional independence. Surprisingly, despite wanting more connection, these workers also felt isolated from peers and doubtful of others' labor quality. They resisted collaboration and gender-based tools, valuing gender-neutrality. Our work advances HCI understanding of Latin American and Caribbean crowdwork, offering insights for digital resistance tools for the region."
2501.07148,"Bandwidth constraints limit LoRa implementations. Contemporary IoT applications require higher throughput than that provided by LoRa. This work introduces a LoRa Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system and a spatial multiplexing algorithm to address LoRa's bandwidth limitation. The transceivers in the proposed approach modulate the signals on distinct frequencies of the same LoRa band. A Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) method is used at the transmitters to provide a wider MIMO channel. Unlike conventional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) techniques, this work exploits the orthogonality of the LoRa signals facilitated by its proprietary Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation to perform an OFDM in the proposed LoRa MIMO system. By varying the Spreading Factor (SF) and bandwidth of LoRa signals, orthogonal signals can transmit on the same frequency irrespective of the FDM. Even though the channel correlation is minimal for different spreading factors and bandwidths, different Carrier Frequencies (CF) ensure the signals do not overlap and provide additional degrees of freedom. This work assesses the proposed model's performance and conducts an extensive analysis to provide an overview of resources consumed by the proposed system. Finally, this work provides the detailed results of a thorough evaluation of the model on test hardware."
2501.07473,"Political polarization, a key driver of social fragmentation, has drawn increasing attention for its role in shaping online and offline discourse. Despite significant efforts, accurately measuring polarization within ideological distributions remains a challenge. This study evaluates five widely used polarization measures, testing their strengths and weaknesses with synthetic datasets and a real-world case study on YouTube discussions during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Building on these findings, we present a novel adaptation of Kleinberg's burst detection algorithm to improve mode detection in polarized distributions. By offering both a critical review and an innovative methodological tool, this work advances the analysis of ideological patterns in social media discourse."
2501.07486,"This article explores the evolution of constructionism as an educational framework, tracing its relevance and transformation across three pivotal eras: the advent of personal computing, the networked society, and the current era of generative AI. Rooted in Seymour Papert constructionist philosophy, this study examines how constructionist principles align with the expanding role of digital technology in personal and collective learning. We discuss the transformation of educational environments from hierarchical instructionism to constructionist models that emphasize learner autonomy and interactive, creative engagement. Central to this analysis is the concept of an expanded personality, wherein digital tools and AI integration fundamentally reshape individual self-perception and social interactions. By integrating constructionism into the paradigm of smart education, we propose it as a foundational approach to personalized and democratized learning. Our findings underscore constructionism enduring relevance in navigating the complexities of technology-driven education, providing insights for educators and policymakers seeking to harness digital innovations to foster adaptive, student-centered learning experiences."
2501.0757,"With rapid digitization and digitalization, drawing a fine line between the digital and the physical world has become nearly impossible. It has become essential more than ever to integrate all spheres of life into a single Digital Thread to address pressing challenges of modern society: accessible and inclusive healthcare in terms of equality and equity. Techno-social advancements and mutual acceptance have enabled the infusion of digital models to simulate social settings with minimum resource utilization to make effective decisions. However, a significant gap exists in feeding back the models with appropriate real-time changes. In other words, active behavioral modeling of modern society is lacking, influencing community healthcare as a whole. By creating virtual replicas of (physical) behavioral systems, digital twins can enable real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization of urban dynamics. This paper explores the potential of digital twins to promote inclusive healthcare for evolving smart cities. We argue that digital twins can be used to: Identify and address disparities in access to healthcare services, Facilitate community participation, Simulate the impact of urban policies and interventions on different groups of people, and Aid policy-making bodies for better access to healthcare. This paper proposes several ways to use digital twins to stitch the actual and virtual societies. Several discussed concepts within this framework envision an active, integrated, and synchronized community aware of data privacy and security. The proposal also provides high-level step-wise transitions that will enable this transformation."
2501.07839,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly transformed global lifestyles, enforcing physical isolation and accelerating digital adoption for work, education, and social interaction. This study examines the pandemic's impact on mental health by analyzing dream content shared on the Reddit r/Dreams community. With over 374,000 subscribers, this platform offers a rich dataset for exploring subconscious responses to the pandemic. Using statistical methods, we assess shifts in dream positivity, negativity, and neutrality from the pre-pandemic to post-pandemic era. To enhance our analysis, we fine-tuned the LLaMA 3.1-8B model with labeled data, enabling precise sentiment classification of dream content. Our findings aim to uncover patterns in dream content, providing insights into the psychological effects of the pandemic and its influence on subconscious processes. This research highlights the profound changes in mental landscapes and the role of dreams as indicators of public well-being during unprecedented times."
2501.07858,"This study explores the representation of youth in US policy documents by analyzing how research on youth topics is cited within these policies. The research focuses on three key questions: identifying the frequently discussed topics in youth research that receive citations in policy documents, discerning patterns in youth research that contribute to higher citation rates in policy, and comparing the alignment between topics in youth research and those in citing policy documents. Through this analysis, the study aims to shed light on the relationship between academic research and policy formulation, highlighting areas where youth issues are effectively integrated into policy and contributing to the broader goal of enhancing youth engagement in societal decision-making processes."
2501.07883,"As trends in education evolve, personalized learning has transformed individuals' engagement with knowledge and skill development. In the digital age, state-of-the-art technologies have been increasingly integrated into classrooms to support intelligent education and foster personalized learning experiences. One promising approach is the use of eye-tracking technology to evaluate student engagement in intelligent virtual classrooms. This paper explores the assessment of personalized learning in the virtual classroom and its impact on student engagement through the eye movement paradigm. The study aims to provide insights into how personalized learning approaches can enhance student participation, motivation, and academic performance in the online learning environment. Through a comprehensive literature review, case study, and data analysis, the paper examines the key elements of personalized learning, the methods of assessment, and the resulting effects on student engagement. The findings suggest that the eye movement paradigm has the potential to assess student engagement and promote better educational outcomes."
2501.08262,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities, but their widespread deployment and more advanced applications raise critical sustainability challenges, particularly in inference energy consumption. We propose the concept of the Sustainable AI Trilemma, highlighting the tensions between AI capability, digital equity, and environmental sustainability. Through a systematic case study of LLM agents and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we analyze the energy costs embedded in memory module designs and introduce novel metrics to quantify the trade-offs between energy consumption and system performance. Our experimental results reveal significant energy inefficiencies in current memory-augmented frameworks and demonstrate that resource-constrained environments face disproportionate efficiency penalties. Our findings challenge the prevailing LLM-centric paradigm in agent design and provide practical insights for developing more sustainable AI systems."
2501.08365,"Many AI companies are training their large language models (LLMs) on data without the permission of the copyright owners. The permissibility of doing so varies by jurisdiction: in countries like the EU and Japan, this is allowed under certain restrictions, while in the United States, the legal landscape is more ambiguous. Regardless of the legal status, concerns from creative producers have led to several high-profile copyright lawsuits, and the threat of litigation is commonly cited as a reason for the recent trend towards minimizing the information shared about training datasets by both corporate and public interest actors. This trend in limiting data information causes harm by hindering transparency, accountability, and innovation in the broader ecosystem by denying researchers, auditors, and impacted individuals access to the information needed to understand AI models.While this could be mitigated by training language models on open access and public domain data, at the time of writing, there are no such models (trained at a meaningful scale) due to the substantial technical and sociological challenges in assembling the necessary corpus. These challenges include incomplete and unreliable metadata, the cost and complexity of digitizing physical records, and the diverse set of legal and technical skills required to ensure relevance and responsibility in a quickly changing landscape. Building towards a future where AI systems can be trained on openly licensed data that is responsibly curated and governed requires collaboration across legal, technical, and policy domains, along with investments in metadata standards, digitization, and fostering a culture of openness."
2501.08429,"A person is directly racially discriminated against only if her race caused her worse treatment. This implies that race is an attribute sufficiently separable from other attributes to isolate its causal role. But race is embedded in a nexus of social factors that resist isolated treatment. If race is socially constructed, in what sense can it cause worse treatment? Some propose that the perception of race, rather than race itself, causes worse treatment. Others suggest that since causal models require \textit{modularity}, i.e. the ability to isolate causal effects, attempts to causally model discrimination are misguided.This paper addresses the problem differently. We introduce a framework for reasoning about discrimination, in which race is a high-level \textit{abstraction} of lower-level features. In this framework, race can be modeled as itself causing worse treatment. Modularity is ensured by allowing assumptions about social construction to be precisely and explicitly stated, via an alignment between race and its constituents. Such assumptions can then be subjected to normative and empirical challenges, which lead to different views of when discrimination occurs. By distinguishing constitutive and causal relations, the abstraction framework pinpoints disagreements in the current literature on modeling discrimination, while preserving a precise causal account of discrimination."
2501.08466,"Micro-delivery services offer promising solutions for on-demand city logistics, but their success relies on efficient real-time delivery operations and fleet management. On-demand meal delivery platforms seek to optimize real-time operations based on anticipatory insights into citywide demand distributions. To address these needs, this study proposes a short-term predict-then-cluster framework for on-demand meal delivery services. The framework utilizes ensemble-learning methods for point and distributional forecasting with multivariate features, including lagged-dependent inputs to capture demand dynamics. We introduce Constrained K-Means Clustering (CKMC) and Contiguity Constrained Hierarchical Clustering with Iterative Constraint Enforcement (CCHC-ICE) to generate dynamic clusters based on predicted demand and geographical proximity, tailored to user-defined operational constraints. Evaluations of European and Taiwanese case studies demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform traditional time series approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Clustering results demonstrate that the incorporation of distributional predictions effectively addresses demand uncertainties, improving the quality of operational insights. Additionally, a simulation study demonstrates the practical value of short-term demand predictions for proactive strategies, such as idle fleet rebalancing, significantly enhancing delivery efficiency. By addressing demand uncertainties and operational constraints, our predict-then-cluster framework provides actionable insights for optimizing real-time operations. The approach is adaptable to other on-demand platform-based city logistics and passenger mobility services, promoting sustainable and efficient urban operations."
2501.08473,The case study examines the impact of the CGScholar (Common Ground Scholar) AI Helper on a pilot research initiative involving the writing development of 11th-grade students in English Language Arts (ELA). CGScholar AI Helper is an evolving and innovative web-based application designed to support students in their writing tasks by providing specified AI-generated feedback. This study is one of six interventions. It involved one teacher and six students in a diverse school with low income students and explored to what extent customized AI-driven feedback can support students' writing development. The findings suggest that the implementation of AI Helper supported the development of students' writing in a number of ways. It also elicited suggestions from the teacher and students about ways of improving the still in development tool.
2501.08497,"The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical diagnostics necessitates a critical examination of its ethical and practical implications. While the prioritization of diagnostic accuracy, as advocated by Sabuncu et al. (2025), is essential, this approach risks oversimplifying complex socio-ethical issues, including fairness, privacy, and intersectionality. This rebuttal emphasizes the dangers of reducing multifaceted health disparities to quantifiable metrics and advocates for a more transdisciplinary approach. By incorporating insights from social sciences, ethics, and public health, AI systems can address the compounded effects of intersecting identities and safeguard sensitive data. Additionally, explainability and interpretability must be central to AI design, fostering trust and accountability. This paper calls for a framework that balances accuracy with fairness, privacy, and inclusivity to ensure AI-driven diagnostics serve diverse populations equitably and ethically."
2501.09021,"The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in research presents both opportunities and ethical challenges that should be carefully navigated. Although GenAI tools can enhance research efficiency through automation of tasks such as literature review and data analysis, their use raises concerns about aspects such as data accuracy, privacy, bias, and research integrity. This paper develops the ETHICAL framework, which is a practical guide for responsible GenAI use in research. Employing a constructivist case study examining multiple GenAI tools in real research contexts, the framework consists of seven key principles: Examine policies and guidelines, Think about social impacts, Harness understanding of the technology, Indicate use, Critically engage with outputs, Access secure versions, and Look at user agreements. Applying these principles will enable researchers to uphold research integrity while leveraging GenAI benefits. The framework addresses a critical gap between awareness of ethical issues and practical action steps, providing researchers with concrete guidance for ethical GenAI integration. This work has implications for research practice, institutional policy development, and the broader academic community while adapting to an AI-enhanced research landscape. The ETHICAL framework can serve as a foundation for developing AI literacy in academic settings and promoting responsible innovation in research methodologies."
2501.09235,"This paper examines how gifting spreads among viewers on Twitch, one of the largest live streaming platforms worldwide. Twitch users can give gift subscriptions to other viewers in the chat room, with the majority of gifters opting for community gifting, which is gifting to randomly selected viewers. We identify the random nature of gift-receiving in our data as a natural experiment setting. We investigate whether gift recipients pay it forward, considering various gift types that may either promote or deter the spread of gifting. Our findings reveal that Twitch viewers who receive gift subscriptions are generally more likely to pay it forward than non-recipients, and the positive impact of gift-receiving becomes stronger when the recipient is the sole beneficiary of the giver's gifting behavior. However, we found that gifts from frequent gifters discourage recipients from paying it forward, and gifts from anonymous gifters do not influence the likelihood of viewers becoming future gifters. This research contributes to the existing literature on the spread of online prosocial behavior by providing robust evidence and suggests practical strategies for promoting online gifting."
2501.09275,"BitTorrent remains a prominent channel for illicit distribution of copyrighted material, yet the supply side of such content remains understudied. We introduce MagnetDB, a longitudinal dataset of torrents discovered through the BitTorrent DHT between 2018 and 2024, containing more than 28.6 million torrents and metadata of more than 950 million files. While our primary focus is on enabling research based on the supply of pirated movies and TV shows, the dataset also encompasses other legitimate and illegitimate torrents. By applying IMDb-matching and annotation to movie and TV show torrents, MagnetDB facilitates detailed analyses of pirated content evolution in the BitTorrent network. Researchers can leverage MagnetDB to examine distribution trends, subcultural practices, and the gift economy within piracy ecosystems. Through its scale and temporal scope, MagnetDB presents a unique opportunity for investigating the broader dynamics of BitTorrent and advancing empirical knowledge on digital piracy."
2501.09309,"This review underscores the critical need for effective strategies to identify and support individuals with suicidal ideation, exploiting technological innovations in ML and DL to further suicide prevention efforts. The study details the application of these technologies in analyzing vast amounts of unstructured social media data to detect linguistic patterns, keywords, phrases, tones, and contextual cues associated with suicidal thoughts. It explores various ML and DL models like SVMs, CNNs, LSTM, neural networks, and their effectiveness in interpreting complex data patterns and emotional nuances within text data. The review discusses the potential of these technologies to serve as a life-saving tool by identifying at-risk individuals through their digital traces. Furthermore, it evaluates the real-world effectiveness, limitations, and ethical considerations of employing these technologies for suicide prevention, stressing the importance of responsible development and usage. The study aims to fill critical knowledge gaps by analyzing recent studies, methodologies, tools, and techniques in this field. It highlights the importance of synthesizing current literature to inform practical tools and suicide prevention efforts, guiding innovation in reliable, ethical systems for early intervention. This research synthesis evaluates the intersection of technology and mental health, advocating for the ethical and responsible application of ML, DL, and NLP to offer life-saving potential worldwide while addressing challenges like generalizability, biases, privacy, and the need for further research to ensure these technologies do not exacerbate existing inequities and harms."
2501.09401,"Mobile government (m-government) represents a distinct paradigm shift from electronic government (e-government), offering a new avenue for governments worldwide to deliver services and applications to their customers. The m-government model deviates from e-government in terms of information technology (IT) infrastructure, security, and application management and implementation. Enterprise architecture (EA) has been developed and utilized globally to enhance efficiency and information and communication technology (ICT) utilization in the public sector through e-government. However, the application of EA within the context of m-government, particularly in developing countries, has largely been overlooked by scholars. This study aims to address this gap. This study seeks to develop an EA specifically tailored for m-government in a developmental context. Our contribution to the literature is the illustration of a proposed EA framework for m-government. The practical implementation of this study is to identify critical considerations when designing and adopting m-government to avoid redundant investments during the integration of infrastructure and applications from e-government to m-government."
2501.09407,"Buildings are significant contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 26% of global energy sector emissions in 2022. Meeting net zero goals requires a rapid reduction in building emissions, both directly from the buildings and indirectly from the production of electricity and heat used in buildings. National energy planning for net zero demands both detailed and comprehensive building energy consumption data. However, geo-located building-level energy data is rarely available in Europe, with analysis typically relying on anonymised, simulated or low-resolution data. To address this problem, we introduce a dataset of Neighbourhood Energy, Buildings, and Urban Landscapes (NEBULA) for modelling domestic energy consumption for small neighbourhoods (5-150 households). NEBULA integrates data on building characteristics, climate, urbanisation, environment, and socio-demographics and contains 609,964 samples across England and Wales."
2501.09479,"The impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming various aspects of urban life, including, governance, policy and planning, healthcare, sustainability, economics, entrepreneurship, etc. Although AI immense potential for positively impacting urban living, its success depends on overcoming significant challenges, particularly in telecommunications infrastructure. Smart city applications, such as, federated learning, Internet of Things (IoT), and online financial services, require reliable Quality of Service (QoS) from telecommunications networks to ensure effective information transfer. However, with over three billion people underserved or lacking access to internet, many of these AI-driven applications are at risk of either remaining underutilized or failing altogether. Furthermore, many IoT and video-based applications in densely populated urban areas require high-quality connectivity. This paper explores these issues, focusing on the challenges that need to be mitigated to make AI succeed in emerging countries, where more than 80% of the world population resides and urban migration grows. In this context, an overview of a case study conducted in Kathmandu, Nepal, highlights citizens' aspirations for affordable, high-quality internet-based services. The findings underscore the pressing need for advanced telecommunication networks to meet diverse user requirements while addressing investment and infrastructure gaps. This discussion provides insights into bridging the digital divide and enabling AI's transformative potential in urban areas."
2501.09482,"Papua New Guinea (PNG) is an emerging tech society with an opportunity to overcome geographic and social boundaries, in order to engage with the global market. However, the current tech landscape, dominated by Big Tech in Silicon Valley and other multinational companies in the Global North, tends to overlook the requirements of emerging economies such as PNG. This is becoming more obvious as issues such as algorithmic bias (in tech product deployments) and the digital divide (as in the case of non-affordable commercial software) are affecting PNG users. The Open Source Software (OSS) movement, based on extant research, is seen as a way to level the playing field in the digitalization and adoption of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) in PNG. This perspectives paper documents the outcome of the second International Workshop on BRIdging the Divides with Globally Engineered Software} (BRIDGES2023) in the hopes of proposing ideas for future research into ICT education, uplifting software engineering (SE) capability, and OSS adoption in promoting a more equitable digital future for PNG."
2501.09601,"In the past few years, ""metaverse"" and ""non-fungible tokens (NFT)"" have become buzzwords, and the prices of related assets have exhibited large fluctuations. Are those characteristic of a speculative bubble? In this paper, we attempt to answer this question, and better understand the underlying economic dynamics. We look at Decentraland, a virtual world platform where land parcels are sold as NFT collections. We find that initially, land prices followed traditional real estate pricing models - in particular, value decreased with distance from the most desirable areas - suggesting Decentraland behaved much like a virtual city. However, these real estate pricing models stopped applying when both the metaverse and NFTs gained increased popular attention and enthusiasm in 2021, suggesting a new driving force for the underlying asset prices. At that time, following a substantial rise in NFT market values, short-term holders of multiple parcels began to take major selling positions in the Decentraland market, which hints that, rather than building a metaverse community, early Decentraland investors preferred to cash out when land valuations became inflated. Our analysis also shows that while the majority of buyers are new entrants to the market (many of whom joined during the bubble), liquidity (i.e., parcels) was mostly provided by early adopters selling, which caused stark differences in monetary gains. Early adopters made money - more than 10,000 USD on average per parcel sold - but users who joined later typically made no profit or even incurred losses in the order of 1,000 USD per parcel. Unlike established markets such as financial and real estate markets, newly emergent digital marketplaces are mostly self-regulated. As a result, the significant financial risks we identify indicate a strong need for establishing appropriate standards of business conduct and improving user awareness."
2501.09606,"This paper presents a survey of local US policymakers' views on the future impact and regulation of AI. Our survey provides insight into US policymakers' expectations regarding the effects of AI on local communities and the nation, as well as their attitudes towards specific regulatory policies. Conducted in two waves (2022 and 2023), the survey captures changes in attitudes following the release of ChatGPT and the subsequent surge in public awareness of AI. Local policymakers express a mix of concern, optimism, and uncertainty about AI's impacts, anticipating significant societal risks such as increased surveillance, misinformation, and political polarization, alongside potential benefits in innovation and infrastructure. Many also report feeling underprepared and inadequately informed to make AI-related decisions. On regulation, a majority of policymakers support government oversight and favor specific policies addressing issues such as data privacy, AI-related unemployment, and AI safety and fairness. Democrats show stronger and more consistent support for regulation than Republicans, but the latter experienced a notable shift towards majority support between 2022 and 2023. Our study contributes to understanding the perspectives of local policymakers-key players in shaping state and federal AI legislation-by capturing evolving attitudes, partisan dynamics, and their implications for policy formation. The findings highlight the need for capacity-building initiatives and bi-partisan coordination to mitigate policy fragmentation and build a cohesive framework for AI governance in the US."
2501.09674,"The rapid deployment of autonomous AI agents creates urgent challenges around authorization, accountability, and access control in digital spaces. New standards are needed to know whom AI agents act on behalf of and guide their use appropriately, protecting online spaces while unlocking the value of task delegation to autonomous agents. We introduce a novel framework for authenticated, authorized, and auditable delegation of authority to AI agents, where human users can securely delegate and restrict the permissions and scope of agents while maintaining clear chains of accountability. This framework builds on existing identification and access management protocols, extending OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect with agent-specific credentials and metadata, maintaining compatibility with established authentication and web infrastructure. Further, we propose a framework for translating flexible, natural language permissions into auditable access control configurations, enabling robust scoping of AI agent capabilities across diverse interaction modalities. Taken together, this practical approach facilitates immediate deployment of AI agents while addressing key security and accountability concerns, working toward ensuring agentic AI systems perform only appropriate actions and providing a tool for digital service providers to enable AI agent interactions without risking harm from scalable interaction."
2501.09709,"Many non-traditional students in cybersecurity programs often lack access to advice from peers, family members and professors, which can hinder their educational experiences. Additionally, these students may not fully benefit from various LLM-powered AI assistants due to issues like content relevance, locality of advice, minimum expertise, and timing. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing an application designed to provide comprehensive support by answering questions related to knowledge, skills, and career preparation advice tailored to the needs of these students. We developed a learning tool platform, CyberMentor, to address the diverse needs and pain points of students majoring in cybersecurity. Powered by agentic workflow and Generative Large Language Models (LLMs), the platform leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for accurate and contextually relevant information retrieval to achieve accessibility and personalization. We demonstrated its value in addressing knowledge requirements for cybersecurity education and for career marketability, in tackling skill requirements for analytical and programming assignments, and in delivering real time on demand learning support. Using three use scenarios, we showcased CyberMentor in facilitating knowledge acquisition and career preparation and providing seamless skill-based guidance and support. We also employed the LangChain prompt-based evaluation methodology to evaluate the platform's impact, confirming its strong performance in helpfulness, correctness, and completeness. These results underscore the system's ability to support students in developing practical cybersecurity skills while improving equity and sustainability within higher education. Furthermore, CyberMentor's open-source design allows for adaptation across other disciplines, fostering educational innovation and broadening its potential impact."
2501.09906,"This position paper analyzes the evolving roles of open-source and closed-source large language models (LLMs) in healthcare, emphasizing their distinct contributions and the scientific community's response to their development. Due to their advanced reasoning capabilities, closed LLMs, such as GPT-4, have dominated high-performance applications, particularly in medical imaging and multimodal diagnostics. Conversely, open LLMs, like Meta's LLaMA, have gained popularity for their adaptability and cost-effectiveness, enabling researchers to fine-tune models for specific domains, such as mental health and patient communication."
2501.10264,"High-performance computing (HPC) is widely used in higher education for modeling, simulation, and AI applications. A critical piece of infrastructure with which to secure funding, attract and retain faculty, and teach students, supercomputers come with high capital and operating costs that must be considered against other competing priorities. This study applies the concepts of the production function model from economics with two thrusts: 1) to evaluate if previous research on building a model for quantifying the value of investment in research computing is generalizable to a wider set of universities, and 2) to define a model with which to capacity plan HPC investment, based on institutional production - inverting the production function. We show that the production function model does appear to generalize, showing positive institutional returns from the investment in computing resources and staff. We do, however, find that the relative relationships between model inputs and outputs vary across institutions, which can often be attributed to understandable institution-specific factors."
2501.10275,"Research on Digital Humanities (DH) has been boosted due to the investment in technology for developing access and interaction tools for handling Humanities and Heritage data. The availability of these tools lowers the distance between DH scholars and data generators, and students at various levels, not only because it facilitates access to information but also through the dissemination technologies used in these tools, designed for the improvement of user experience. Most of the disciplines associated with the humanities involve geographical and temporal references, often integrated. These references have been scientifically and pedagogically handled for centuries and are established through the use of maps and timelines. Both these supports have been implemented and used digitally and their potential has been risen through their innovative integration with narratives, storytelling and story maps, enabling the telling of historical events in narratives superimposed on maps. These can be enhanced when supported by rich data, such as images, videos, sound, and their possible combinations in virtual and augmented reality. In this paper, we describe an initial set of tools which use a subset of these technologies and data types to enable learning and dissemination of Humanities data and knowledge. We describe how techniques for making data available and tools for enhancing interaction with these data can improve user experience and potentiate learning and dissemination."
2501.10288,"Virtue ethics is a philosophical tradition that emphasizes the cultivation of virtues in achieving the common good. It has been suggested to be an effective framework for envisioning more ethical technology, yet previous work on virtue ethics and technology design has remained at theoretical recommendations. Therefore, we propose an approach for identifying user experience design patterns that embody particular virtues to more concretely articulate virtuous technology designs. As a proof of concept for our approach, we documented seven design patterns for social media that uphold the virtues of Catholic Social Teaching. We interviewed 24 technology researchers and industry practitioners to evaluate these patterns. We found that overall the patterns enact the virtues they were identified to embody; our participants valued that the patterns fostered intentional conversations and personal connections. We pave a path for technology professionals to incorporate diverse virtue traditions into the development of technologies that support human flourishing."
2501.10332,"Personalized learning represents a promising educational strategy within intelligent educational systems, aiming to enhance learners' practice efficiency. However, the discrepancy between offline metrics and online performance significantly impedes their progress. To address this challenge, we introduce Agent4Edu, a novel personalized learning simulator leveraging recent advancements in human intelligence through large language models (LLMs). Agent4Edu features LLM-powered generative agents equipped with learner profile, memory, and action modules tailored to personalized learning algorithms. The learner profiles are initialized using real-world response data, capturing practice styles and cognitive factors. Inspired by human psychology theory, the memory module records practice facts and high-level summaries, integrating reflection mechanisms. The action module supports various behaviors, including exercise understanding, analysis, and response generation. Each agent can interact with personalized learning algorithms, such as computerized adaptive testing, enabling a multifaceted evaluation and enhancement of customized services. Through a comprehensive assessment, we explore the strengths and weaknesses of Agent4Edu, emphasizing the consistency and discrepancies in responses between agents and human learners. The code, data, and appendix are publicly available atthis https URL."
2501.10361,"This paper argues that we should perceive LLMs as machines of extrapolation. Extrapolation is a statistical function for predicting the next value in a series. Extrapolation contributes to both GPT successes and controversies surrounding its hallucination. The term hallucination implies a malfunction, yet this paper contends that it in fact indicates the chatbot efficiency in extrapolation, albeit an excess of it. This article bears a historical dimension: it traces extrapolation to the nascent years of cybernetics. In 1941, when Norbert Wiener transitioned from missile science to communication engineering, the pivotal concept he adopted was none other than extrapolation. Soviet mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov, renowned for his compression logic that inspired OpenAI, had developed in 1939 another extrapolation project that Wiener later found rather like his own. This paper uncovers the connections between hot war science, Cold War cybernetics, and the contemporary debates on LLM performances."
2501.10362,"Organizations need to manage numerous business processes for delivering their services and products to customers. One important consideration thereby lies in the adherence to regulations such as laws, guidelines, or industry standards. In order to monitor adherence of their business processes to regulations -- in other words, their regulatory compliance -- organizations make use of various techniques that draw on process execution data of IT systems that support these processes. Previous research has investigated conformance checking, an operation of process mining, for the domains in which it is applied, its operationalization of regulations, the techniques being used, and the presentation of results produced. However, other techniques for regulatory compliance monitoring, which we summarize as compliance checking techniques, have not yet been investigated regarding these aspects in a structural manner. To this end, this work presents a systematic literature review on uses of regulatory compliance monitoring of business processes, thereby offering insights into the various techniques being used, their application and the results they generate. We highlight commonalities and differences between the approaches and find that various steps are performed manually; we also provide further impulses for research on compliance monitoring and its use in practice."
2501.10363,"DevOps can be best explained as people working together to conceive, build and deliver secure software at top speed. DevOps practices enable software development (dev) and operations (ops) teams to accelerate delivery through automation, collaboration, fast feedback, and iterative improvement. It is now an integral part of the information technology industry, and students should be aware of it before they start their careers. However, teaching DevOps in a university curriculum has many challenges as it involves many tools and technologies. This paper presents an innovative online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed to facilitate DevOps learning within university curricula. The devised tool offers a standardized, accessible learning environment, equipped with devcontainers and engaging tutorials to simplify learning DevOps. Research findings highlight a marked preference among students for self-paced learning approaches, with experienced DevOps practitioners also noting the value of the tool. With barriers such as limited hardware/software access becoming evident, the necessity for cloud-based learning solutions is further underscored. User feedback emphasizes the tool's user-friendliness and the imperative of automated installation procedures. We recommend additional exploration into the tool's extensibility and potential for continuous improvement, especially regarding the development of Dev Containers. The study concludes by emphasizing the pivotal role of practical learning tools in the dynamic field of DevOps education and research."
2501.10364,"Organizations increasingly need to reassess their supply chain strategies in the rapidly modernizing world towards sustainability. This is particularly true in the United States, where supply chains are very extensive and consume a large number of resources. This research paper discusses how AI can support decision-making for sustainable supply chains with a special focus on carbon footprints. These AI technologies, including machine learning, predictive analytics, and optimization algorithms, will enable companies to be more efficient, reduce emissions, and display regulatory and consumer demands for sustainability, among other aspects. The paper reviews challenges and opportunities regarding implementing AI-driven solutions to promote sustainable supply chain practices in the USA."
2501.10365,"This paper investigates various approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify gaps and misconceptions in students' self-explanations of specific instructional material, in our case explanations of code examples. This research is a part of our larger effort to automate the assessment of students' freely generated responses, focusing specifically on their self-explanations of code examples during activities related to code comprehension. In this work, we experiment with zero-shot prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and preference alignment of LLMs to identify gaps in students' self-explanation. With simple prompting, GPT-4 consistently outperformed LLaMA3 and Mistral in identifying gaps and misconceptions, as confirmed by human evaluations. Additionally, our results suggest that fine-tuned large language models are more effective at identifying gaps in students' explanations compared to zero-shot and few-shot prompting techniques. Furthermore, our findings show that the preference optimization approach using Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) outperforms SFT in identifying gaps and misconceptions in students' code explanations."
2501.10366,"Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in healthcare-related applications, their deployment in the medical domain poses unique challenges of ethical, regulatory, and technical nature. In this study, we employ a systematic participatory approach to investigate the needs and expectations regarding clinical applications of LLMs at Lausanne University Hospital, an academic medical center in Switzerland. Having identified potential LLM use-cases in collaboration with thirty stakeholders, including clinical staff across 11 departments as well nursing and patient representatives, we assess the current feasibility of these use-cases taking into account the regulatory frameworks, data protection regulation, bias, hallucinations, and deployment constraints. This study provides a framework for a participatory approach to identifying institutional needs with respect to introducing advanced technologies into healthcare practice, and a realistic analysis of the technology readiness level of LLMs for medical applications, highlighting the issues that would need to be overcome LLMs in healthcare to be ethical, and regulatory compliant."
2501.10368,"Students' answers to tasks provide a valuable source of information in teaching as they result from applying cognitive processes to a learning content addressed in the task. Due to steadily increasing course sizes, analyzing student answers is frequently the only means of obtaining evidence about student performance. However, in many cases, resources are limited, and when evaluating exams, the focus is solely on identifying correct or incorrect answers. This overlooks the value of analyzing incorrect answers, which can help improve teaching strategies or identify misconceptions to be addressed in the next cohort.In teacher training for secondary education, assessment guidelines are mandatory for every exam, including anticipated errors and misconceptions. We applied this concept to a university exam with 462 students and 41 tasks. For each task, the instructors developed answer classes -- classes of expected responses, to which student answers were mapped during the exam correction process. The experiment resulted in a shift in mindset among the tutors and instructors responsible for the course: after initially having great reservations about whether the significant additional effort would yield an appropriate benefit, the procedure was subsequently found to be extremely valuable.The concept presented, and the experience gained from the experiment were cast into a system with which it is possible to correct paper-based exams on the basis of answer classes. This updated version of the paper provides an overview and new potential in the course of using the digital version of the approach."

2501.1037,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming mental health care by enhancing accessibility, personalization, and efficiency in therapeutic interventions. These AI-driven tools empower mental health professionals with real-time support, improved data integration, and the ability to encourage care-seeking behaviors, particularly in underserved communities. By harnessing LLMs, practitioners can deliver more empathetic, tailored, and effective support, addressing longstanding gaps in mental health service provision. However, their implementation comes with significant challenges and ethical concerns. Performance limitations, data privacy risks, biased outputs, and the potential for generating misleading information underscore the critical need for stringent ethical guidelines and robust evaluation mechanisms. The sensitive nature of mental health data further necessitates meticulous safeguards to protect patient rights and ensure equitable access to AI-driven care. Proponents argue that LLMs have the potential to democratize mental health resources, while critics warn of risks such as misuse and the diminishment of human connection in therapy. Achieving a balance between innovation and ethical responsibility is imperative. This paper examines the transformative potential of LLMs in mental health care, highlights the associated technical and ethical complexities, and advocates for a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to ensure these advancements align with the goal of providing compassionate, equitable, and effective mental health support."
2501.10371,"Since July 5, 2023, New York City's Local Law 144 requires employers to conduct independent bias audits for any automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) used in hiring processes. The law outlines a minimum set of bias tests that AI developers and implementers must perform to ensure compliance. Over the past few months, we have collected and analyzed audits conducted under this law, identified best practices, and developed a software tool to streamline employer compliance. Our tool, ITACA_144, tailors our broader bias auditing framework to meet the specific requirements of Local Law 144. While automating these legal mandates, we identified several critical challenges that merit attention to ensure AI bias regulations and audit methodologies are both effective and practical. This document presents the insights gained from automating compliance with NYC Local Law 144. It aims to support other cities and states in crafting similar legislation while addressing the limitations of the NYC framework. The discussion focuses on key areas including data requirements, demographic inclusiveness, impact ratios, effective bias, metrics, and data reliability."
2501.10372,"Asthmatic patients are very frequently affected by the quality of air, climatic conditions, and traffic density during outdoor activities. Most of the conventional routing algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, usually fail to consider these health dimensions, hence resulting in suboptimal or risky recommendations. Here, the health-aware heuristic framework is presented that shall utilize real-time data provided by the Microsoft Weather API. The advanced A* algorithm provides dynamic changes in routes depending on air quality indices, temperature, traffic density, and other patient-related health data. The power of the model is realized by running simulations in city environments and outperforming the state-of-the-art methodology in terms of recommendation accuracy at low computational overhead. It provides health-sensitive route recommendations, keeping in mind the avoidance of high-risk areas and ensuring safer and more suitable travel options for asthmatic patients."
2501.10373,"This study introduces DK-PRACTICE (Dynamic Knowledge Prediction and Educational Content Recommendation System), an intelligent online platform that leverages machine learning to provide personalized learning recommendations based on student knowledge state. Students participate in a short, adaptive assessment using the question-and-answer method regarding key concepts in a specific knowledge domain. The system dynamically selects the next question for each student based on the correctness and accuracy of their previous answers. After the test is completed, DK-PRACTICE analyzes students' interaction history to recommend learning materials to empower the student's knowledge state in identified knowledge gaps. Both question selection and learning material recommendations are based on machine learning models trained using anonymized data from a real learning environment. To provide self-assessment and monitor learning progress, DK-PRACTICE allows students to take two tests: one pre-teaching and one post-teaching. After each test, a report is generated with detailed results. In addition, the platform offers functions to visualize learning progress based on recorded test statistics. DK-PRACTICE promotes adaptive and personalized learning by empowering students with self-assessment capabilities and providing instructors with valuable information about students' knowledge levels. DK-PRACTICE can be extended to various educational environments and knowledge domains, provided the necessary data is available according to the educational topics. A subsequent paper will present the methodology for the experimental application and evaluation of the platform."
2501.10374,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field that is upturning mental health care in many ways, from addressing anxiety, depression, and stress to increasing access, personalization of treatment, and real-time monitoring that enhances patient outcomes. The current paper discusses the evolution, present application, and future challenges in the field of AI for mental health and well-being. From the early chatbot models, such as ELIZA, to modern machine learning systems, the integration of AI in mental health has grown rapidly to augment traditional treatment and open innovative solutions. AI-driven tools provide continuous support, offering personalized interventions and addressing issues such as treatment access and patient stigma. AI also enables early diagnosis through the analysis of complex datasets, including speech patterns and social media behavior, to detect early signs of conditions like depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Ethical challenges persist, however, most notably around privacy, data security, and algorithmic bias. With AI at the core of mental health care, there is a dire need to develop strong ethical frameworks that ensure patient rights are protected, access is equitable, and transparency is maintained in AI applications. Going forward, the role of AI in mental health will continue to evolve, and continued research and policy development will be needed to meet the diverse needs of patients while mitigating associated risks."
2501.10377,"The development and deployment of chatbot technology, while spanning decades and employing different techniques, require innovative frameworks to understand and interrogate their functionality and implications. A mere technocentric account of the evolution of chatbot technology does not fully illuminate how conversational systems are embedded in societal dynamics. This study presents a structured examination of chatbots across three societal dimensions, highlighting their roles as objects of scientific research, commercial instruments, and agents of intimate interaction. Through furnishing a dimensional framework for the evolution of conversational systems, from laboratories to marketplaces to private lives, this article contributes to the wider scholarly inquiry of chatbot technology and its impact in lived human experiences and dynamics."
2501.10378,"This article examines the broader societal implications of blockchain technology and crypto-assets, emphasizing their role in the evolution of humanity as a ""superorganism"" with decentralized, self-regulating systems. Drawing on interdisciplinary concepts such as Nate Hagens' ""superorganism"" idea and Francis Heylighen's ""global brain"" theory, the paper contextualizes blockchain technology within the ongoing evolution of governance systems and global systems such as the financial system. Blockchain's decentralized nature, in conjunction with advancements like artificial intelligence and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), could transform traditional financial, economic, and governance structures by enabling the emergence of collective distributed decision-making and global coordination. In parallel, the article aligns blockchain's impact with developmental theories such as Spiral Dynamics. This framework is used to illustrate blockchain's potential to foster societal growth beyond hierarchical models, promoting a shift from centralized authority to collaborative and self-governed communities. The analysis provides a holistic view of blockchain as more than an economic tool, positioning it as a catalyst for the evolution of society into a mature, interconnected global planetary organism."
2501.10379,"In the Frontier AI Safety Commitments, sixteen companies committed to ""Assess the risks posed by their frontier models or systems across the AI lifecycle, including [...] as appropriate, before and during training"" (I) and to ""Provide public transparency on the implementation of the above (I-VI), except insofar as doing so would increase risk or divulge sensitive commercial information to a degree disproportionate to the societal benefit.

This short paper considers what information should be shared with whom before training begins. What information should be shared publicly and what only with trusted actors such as home governments? Sharing such information before a frontier training run can build shared awareness and preparedness, can improve risk assessment and management, and can contribute to greater predictability and accountability. Companies could share certain information before a training run including:Expected dates of beginning and end of training;Expected compute used (in FLOP);Description of the pre-training dataset(s);Expected capability level of the frontier model or system, including an assessment of potential risks and whether this capability will approach any risk threshold;How the company will monitor progress, capabilities and risks during training;Location, ownership, primary energy source of the large-scale computing cluster(s);Physical, personnel and cybersecurity steps taken; andWhich internal and external groups have been tasked to carry out evaluations and red-teaming and what level of resources, support and time they have available to do so."
2501.1038,"Analysis of the scientific literature showed that a lot of work is devoted to assessing the effectiveness of fire safety management in an enterprise. It is worth noting that today there is no universal method for the integrated assessment of fire safety management, taking into account the interconnectedness of all enterprise subsystems and the influence of environmental factors. One of the original approaches to assessing the effectiveness of the fire safety management system is the method of integral indicators. The method of integral indicators is used in the algorithm for analyzing the state of a dynamic non-stationary system for assessing fire safety management in an enterprise. The algorithm is implemented in the author's complex of programs described in the text of the article. In the simulation, an analysis of 1.2 million values is performed on a well-studied economic object with the spaces identified at each time step: actual data, control and environmental parameters. In the experiment, the basic mode of operation of the enterprise does not contain the implementation of a fire safety management strategy. The research showed significant changes in the values of the integral indicator characterizing the state of the enterprise during the implementation of the fire safety management system at the enterprise."
2501.10381,"Application of Universal Competencies in Russian educational institutions is very important. Based on them, educational standards are invented. However, there is no universal assessment of the application of the Universal Competencies in practice. The main idea of the research is a general assessment of the application of universal competencies. For this, the activity of the enterprise is modeled. The enterprise process model is combined with the Universal Competencies. Further, the measurement is made by a universal indicator. The analysis of the dynamics of the universal indicator proves the existence of an assessment of the application of the Universal Competencies at a production facility. The integral indicator is a universal assessment of the application of the Universal Competencies."
2501.10382,"Public and private interest in life cycle assessment (LCA) has grown as environmental disclosure norms tighten, driving demand for decision-relevant assessment early in technological development cycles. Early-stage LCA has the potential to guide design choices, steer innovation, and mitigate lock-in of adverse environmental impacts. However, many aspects of early-stage LCA practice remain unsettled. We convened experts in a series of Faraday Discussion-style workshops to address recurring debates across six key topics for emerging technologies: appropriate use of LCA, uncertainty, comparison with incumbents, standardization, scale-up, and stakeholder engagement. For each issue, we present a declarative resolution, summarize key arguments for and against it, identify points of consensus, and provide recommendations. Across topics, the research network converged on practical priorities including framing studies to the decision context; setting minimum reporting expectations for data and study quality; and explicitly stating limits of transferability for scenario-based uncertainty assessment or analytically scaled-up projections. Disagreements persisted on when to formalize standards and how extensively uncertainty can/should be treated for low-maturity technologies. Supplementing the workshop findings with examples and context from relevant literature, we synthesize outcomes into a set of shared challenges and research priorities to strengthen transparent, evidence-based, and context-informed approaches for early-stage LCA."
2501.10383,"The Generative AI Ethics Playbook provides guidance for identifying and mitigating risks of machine learning systems across various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and generative AI. This playbook aims to assist practitioners in diagnosing potential harms that may arise during the design, development, and deployment of datasets and models. It offers concrete strategies and resources for mitigating these risks, to help minimize negative impacts on users and society. Drawing on current best practices in both research and ethical considerations, this playbook aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for AI/ML practitioners. The intended audience of this playbook includes machine learning researchers, engineers, and practitioners who are involved in the creation and implementation of generative and multimodal models (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image, text-to-image, text-to-video).Specifically, we provide transparency/documentation checklists, topics of interest, common questions, examples of harms through case studies, and resources and strategies to mitigate harms throughout the Generative AI lifecycle. This playbook was made collaboratively over the course of 16 months through extensive literature review of over 100 resources and peer-reviewed articles, as well as through an initial group brainstorming session with 18 interdisciplinary AI ethics experts from industry and academia, and with additional feedback from 8 experts (5 of whom were in the initial brainstorming session).We note that while this playbook provides examples, discussion, and harm mitigation strategies, research in this area is ongoing. Our playbook aims to be a practically useful survey, taking a high-level view rather than aiming for covering the entire existing body of research."
2501.10384,"This research applies Harold Demsetz's concept of the nirvana approach to the realm of AI governance and debunks three common fallacies in various AI policy proposals--""the grass is always greener on the other side,"" ""free lunch,"" and ""the people could be different."" Through this, I expose fundamental flaws in the current AI regulatory proposal. First, some commentators intuitively believe that people are more reliable than machines and that government works better in risk control than companies' self-regulation, but they do not fully compare the differences between the status quo and the proposed replacements. Second, when proposing some regulatory tools, some policymakers and researchers do not realize and even gloss over the fact that harms and costs are also inherent in their proposals. Third, some policy proposals are initiated based on a false comparison between the AI-driven world, where AI does lead to some risks, and an entirely idealized world, where no risk exists at all. However, the appropriate approach is to compare the world where AI causes risks to the real world where risks are everywhere, but people can live well with these risks. The prevalence of these fallacies in AI governance underscores a broader issue: the tendency to idealize potential solutions without fully considering their real-world implications. This idealization can lead to regulatory proposals that are not only impractical but potentially harmful to innovation and societal progress."
2501.10385,"Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing self driving laboratories (SDLs) for materials research, promising unprecedented acceleration of scientific discovery. However, current SDL implementations rely on rigid protocols that fail to capture the adaptability and intuition of expert scientists in dynamic experimental settings. We introduce Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant (AILA), a framework automating atomic force microscopy through LLM driven agents. Further, we develop AFMBench a comprehensive evaluation suite challenging AI agents across the complete scientific workflow from experimental design to results analysis. We find that state of the art models struggle with basic tasks and coordination scenarios. Notably, Claude 3.5 sonnet performs unexpectedly poorly despite excelling in materials domain question answering (QA) benchmarks, revealing that domain specific QA proficiency does not necessarily translate to effective agentic capabilities. Additionally, we observe that LLMs can deviate from instructions, raising safety alignment concerns for SDL applications. Our ablations reveal that multi agent frameworks outperform single-agent architectures. We also observe significant prompt fragility, where slight modifications in prompt structure cause substantial performance variations in capable models like GPT 4o. Finally, we evaluate AILA's effectiveness in increasingly advanced experiments AFM calibration, feature detection, mechanical property measurement, graphene layer counting, and indenter detection. Our findings underscore the necessity for rigorous benchmarking protocols and prompt engineering strategies before deploying AI laboratory assistants in scientific research environments."
2501.10386,"Traditional methods in educational research often fail to capture the complex and evolving nature of learning processes. This chapter examines the use of complex systems theory in education to address these limitations. The chapter covers the main characteristics of complex systems such as non-linear relationships, emergent properties, and feedback mechanisms to explain how educational phenomena unfold. Some of the main methodological approaches are presented, such as network analysis and recurrence quantification analysis to study relationships and patterns in learning. These have been operationalized by existing education research to study self-regulation, engagement, and academic emotions, among other learning-related constructs. Lastly, the chapter describes data collection methods that are suitable for studying learning processes from a complex systems' lens."
2501.10387,"In order to combat the creation and spread of harmful content online, this paper defines and contextualizes the concept of inauthentic, societal-scale manipulation by malicious actors. We review the literature on societally harmful content and how it proliferates to analyze the manipulation strategies used by such actors and the vulnerabilities they target. We also provide an overview of three case studies of extensive manipulation campaigns to emphasize the severity of the problem. We then address the role that Artificial Intelligence plays in the development and dissemination of harmful content, and how its evolution presents new threats to societal cohesion for countries across the globe. Our survey aims to increase our understanding of not just particular aspects of these threats, but also the strategies underlying their deployment, so we can effectively prepare for the evolving cybersecurity landscape."
2501.10388,"The emergence of Large Language Models has fundamentally transformed the capabilities of AI agents, enabling a new class of autonomous agents capable of interacting with their environment through dynamic code generation and execution. These agents possess the theoretical capacity to operate as independent economic actors within digital markets, offering unprecedented potential for value creation through their distinct advantages in operational continuity, perfect replication, and distributed learning capabilities. However, contemporary digital infrastructure, architected primarily for human interaction, presents significant barriers to their participation.This work presents a systematic analysis of the infrastructure requirements necessary for AI agents to function as autonomous participants in digital markets. We examine four key areas - identity and authorization, service discovery, interfaces, and payment systems - to show how existing infrastructure actively impedes agent participation. We argue that addressing these infrastructure challenges represents more than a technical imperative; it constitutes a fundamental step toward enabling new forms of economic organization. Much as traditional markets enable human intelligence to coordinate complex activities beyond individual capability, markets incorporating AI agents could dramatically enhance economic efficiency through continuous operation, perfect information sharing, and rapid adaptation to changing conditions. The infrastructure challenges identified in this work represent key barriers to realizing this potential."
2501.10389,"This paper investigates the impacts of the rapidly evolving landscape of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) development. Emphasis is given to how organizations grapple with a critical imperative: reevaluating their policies regarding AI usage in the workplace. As AI technologies advance, ethical considerations, transparency, data privacy, and their impact on human labor intersect with the drive for innovation and efficiency. Our research explores publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) that often operate on the periphery, away from mainstream scrutiny. These lesser-known models have received limited scholarly analysis and may lack comprehensive restrictions and safeguards. Specifically, we examine Gab AI, a platform that centers around unrestricted communication and privacy, allowing users to interact freely without censorship. Generative AI chatbots are increasingly prevalent, but cybersecurity risks have also escalated. Organizations must carefully navigate this evolving landscape by implementing transparent AI usage policies. Frequent training and policy updates are essential to adapt to emerging threats. Insider threats, whether malicious or unwitting, continue to pose one of the most significant cybersecurity challenges in the workplace. Our research is on the lesser-known publicly accessible LLMs and their implications for workplace policies. We contribute to the ongoing discourse on AI ethics, transparency, and security by emphasizing the need for well-thought-out guidelines and vigilance in policy maintenance."
2501.1039,"In recent years, much research has been dedicated to uncovering the environmental impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI), showing that training and deploying AI systems require large amounts of energy and resources, and the outcomes of AI may lead to decisions and actions that may negatively impact the environment. This new knowledge raises new ethical questions, such as: When is it (un)justifiable to develop an AI system, and how to make design choices, considering its environmental impact? However, so far, the environmental impact of AI has largely escaped ethical scrutiny, as AI ethics tends to focus strongly on themes such as transparency, privacy, safety, responsibility, and bias. Considering the environmental impact of AI from an ethical perspective expands the scope of AI ethics beyond an anthropocentric focus towards including more-than-human actors such as animals and ecosystems. This paper explores the ethical implications of the environmental impact of AI for designing AI systems by drawing on environmental justice literature, in which three categories of justice are distinguished, referring to three elements that can be unjust: the distribution of benefits and burdens (distributive justice), decision-making procedures (procedural justice), and institutionalized social norms (justice as recognition). Based on these tenets of justice, we outline criteria for developing environmentally just AI systems, given their ecological impact."
2501.10391,"The recently published EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is a landmark regulation that regulates the use of AI technologies. One of its novel requirements is the obligation to conduct a Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA), where organisations in the role of deployers must assess the risks of their AI system regarding health, safety, and fundamental rights. Another novelty in the AI Act is the requirement to create a questionnaire and an automated tool to support organisations in their FRIA obligations. Such automated tools will require a machine-readable form of information involved within the FRIA process, and additionally also require machine-readable documentation to enable further compliance tools to be created. In this article, we present our novel representation of the FRIA as an ontology based on semantic web standards. Our work builds upon the existing state of the art, notably the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV), where similar works have been established to create tools for GDPR's Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) and other obligations. Through our ontology, we enable the creation and management of FRIA, and the use of automated tool in its various steps."
2501.10421,"Grading programming assignments is crucial for guiding students to improve their programming skills and coding styles. This study presents an automated grading framework, CodEv, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide consistent and constructive feedback. We incorporate Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting techniques to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and ensure that the grading is aligned with human evaluation. Our framework also integrates LLM ensembles to improve the accuracy and consistency of scores, along with agreement tests to deliver reliable feedback and code review comments. The results demonstrate that the framework can yield grading results comparable to human evaluators, by using smaller LLMs. Evaluation and consistency tests of the LLMs further validate our approach, confirming the reliability of the generated scores and feedback."
2501.10484,"Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled human-like responses across various tasks, raising questions about their ethical decision-making capabilities and potential biases. This study systematically evaluates how nine popular LLMs (both open-source and closed-source) respond to ethical dilemmas involving protected attributes. Across 50,400 trials spanning single and intersectional attribute combinations in four dilemma scenarios (protective vs. harmful), we assess models' ethical preferences, sensitivity, stability, and clustering patterns. Results reveal significant biases in protected attributes in all models, with differing preferences depending on model type and dilemma context. Notably, open-source LLMs show stronger preferences for marginalized groups and greater sensitivity in harmful scenarios, while closed-source models are more selective in protective situations and tend to favor mainstream groups. We also find that ethical behavior varies across dilemma types: LLMs maintain consistent patterns in protective scenarios but respond with more diverse and cognitively demanding decisions in harmful ones. Furthermore, models display more pronounced ethical tendencies under intersectional conditions than in single-attribute settings, suggesting that complex inputs reveal deeper biases. These findings highlight the need for multi-dimensional, context-aware evaluation of LLMs' ethical behavior and offer a systematic evaluation and approach to understanding and addressing fairness in LLM decision-making."
2501.10493,"This study was aimed at finding out if journalists in South East Nigeria have knowledge of Google Translate Application and also utilise it. It adopted a survey design with a sample size of 320 which was determined using Krejcie & Morgan (1970). Its objectives were to ascertain the extent journalists in South East Nigeria know about Google Translate Application, assess the utilisation of Google Translate Application among journalists in South East Nigeria, and identify the challenges affecting the journalists in South East Nigeria while using Google Translate Application. The theoretical underpin was Knowledge Attitude and Practise Model (KAP). The findings showed that journalists in South East Nigeria have knowledge of Google Translate Application but apply it mostly outside the region. It concludes that journalists in South East Nigeria have the knowledge of the App. but apply it outside the zone. The study recommends increased usage of the App. within South East Nigeria."
2501.10576,"In this paper we describe the development and evaluation of AITK, the Artificial Intelligence Toolkit. This open-source project contains both Python libraries and computational essays (Jupyter notebooks) that together are designed to allow a diverse audience with little or no background in AI to interact with a variety of AI tools, exploring in more depth how they function, visualizing their outcomes, and gaining a better understanding of their ethical implications. These notebooks have been piloted at multiple institutions in a variety of humanities courses centered on the theme of responsible AI. In addition, we conducted usability testing of AITK. Our pilot studies and usability testing results indicate that AITK is easy to navigate and effective at helping users gain a better understanding of AI. Our goal, in this time of rapid innovations in AI, is for AITK to provide an accessible resource for faculty from any discipline looking to incorporate AI topics into their courses and for anyone eager to learn more about AI on their own."
2501.10579,"The accelerating pace of developments in Artificial Intelligence~(AI) and the increasing role that technology plays in society necessitates substantial changes in the structure of the workforce. Besides scientists and engineers, there is a need for a very large workforce of competent AI technicians (i.e., maintainers, integrators) and users~(i.e., operators). As traditional 4-year and 2-year degree-based education cannot fill this quickly opening gap, alternative training methods have to be developed. We present the results of the first four years of the AI Technicians program which is a unique collaboration between the U.S. Army's Artificial Intelligence Integration Center (AI2C) and Carnegie Mellon University to design, implement and evaluate novel rapid occupational training methods to create a competitive AI workforce at the technicians level. Through this multi-year effort we have already trained 59 AI Technicians. A key observation is that ongoing frequent updates to the training are necessary as the adoption of AI in the U.S. Army and within the society at large is evolving rapidly. A tight collaboration among the stakeholders from the army and the university is essential for successful development and maintenance of the training for the evolving role. Our findings can be leveraged by large organizations that face the challenge of developing a competent AI workforce as well as educators and researchers engaged in solving the challenge."
2501.10596,"We leverage a recently published dataset of Amazon purchase histories, crowdsourced from thousands of US consumers, to study how online purchasing behaviors have changed over time, how changes vary across demographic groups, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and relationships between online and offline retail. This work provides a case study in how consumer-level purchases data can reveal purchasing behaviors and trends beyond those available from aggregate metrics. For example, in addition to analyzing spending behavior, we develop new metrics to quantify changes in consumers' online purchase frequency and the diversity of products purchased, to better reflect the growing ubiquity and dominance of online retail. Between 2018 and 2022 these consumer-level metrics grew on average by more than 85%, peaking in 2021. We find a steady upward trend in individuals' online purchasing prior to COVID-19, with a significant increase in the first year of COVID, but without a lasting effect. Purchasing behaviors in 2022 were no greater than the result of the pre-pandemic trend. We also find changes in purchasing significantly differ by demographics, with different responses to the pandemic. We further use the consumer-level data to show substitution effects between online and offline retail in sectors where Amazon heavily invested: books, shoes, and grocery. Prior to COVID we find year-to-year changes in the number of consumers making online purchases for books and shoes negatively correlated with changes in employment at local bookstores and shoe stores. During COVID we find online grocery purchasing negatively correlated with in-store grocery visits. This work demonstrates how crowdsourced, open purchases data can enable economic insights that may otherwise only be available to private firms."
2501.10601,"Background: Harnessing advanced computing for scientific discovery and technological innovation demands scientists and engineers well-versed in both domain science and computational science and engineering (CSE). However, few universities provide access to both integrated domain science/CSE cross-training and Top-500 High-Performance Computing (HPC) facilities. National laboratories offer internship opportunities capable of developing these skills. Purpose: This student presents an evaluation of federally-funded postgraduate internship outcomes at a national laboratory. This study seeks to answer three questions: 1) What computational skills, research skills, and professional skills do students improve through internships at the selected national laboratory. 2) Do students gain knowledge in domain science topics through their internships. 3) Do students' career interests change after these internships? Design/Method: We developed a survey and collected responses from past participants of five federally-funded internship programs and compare participant ratings of their prior experience to their internship experience. Findings: Our results indicate that participants improve CSE skills and domain science knowledge, and are more interested in working at national labs. Participants go on to degree programs and positions in relevant domain science topics after their internships. Conclusions: We show that national laboratory internships are an opportunity for students to build CSE skills that may not be available at all institutions. We also show a growth in domain science skills during their internships through direct exposure to research topics. The survey instrument and approach used may be adapted to other studies to measure the impact of postgraduate internships in multiple disciplines and internship settings."
2501.10715,"As governments worldwide increasingly adopt digital tools to enhance citizen engagement and service delivery, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerges as a pivotal advancement in public administration. This study examines the impact of AI-assisted interactions on the quality of communication between citizens and civil servants, focusing on key dimensions such as Satisfaction, Politeness, Ease of Understanding, Feeling Heard, Trust, and Empathy from the citizens' perspective, and Clarity, Politeness, Responsiveness, Respect, Urgency, and Empathy from the civil servants' perspective. Utilizing a questionnaire-based experimental design, the research involved citizens and civil servants who evaluated both original and AI-modified communication samples across five interaction types: Service Requests, Policy Inquiries, Complaints, Suggestions, and Emergency Concerns. Statistical analyses revealed that AI modifications significantly enhanced most communication dimensions for both citizens and civil servants. Specifically, AI-assisted responses led to higher satisfaction, politeness, clarity, and trust among citizens, while also improving clarity, politeness, responsiveness, and respect among civil servants. However, AI interventions showed mixed effects on empathy and urgency from the civil servants' perspective, indicating areas for further refinement. The findings suggest that AI has substantial potential to improve citizen-government interactions, fostering more effective and satisfying communication, while also highlighting the need for continued development to address emotional and urgent communication nuances."
2501.109,"Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) are transforming security by automating many tasks being performed manually. With such automation changing the practice of security as we know it, it is imperative that we prepare future students for the technology landscape they will ultimately face. Towards this end, we describe an initial curriculum and course that attempts to show students how to apply generative AI in order to solve problems in security. By refocusing security education and training on aspects uniquely suited for humans and showing students how to leverage automation for the rest, we believe we can better align security education practices with generative AI as it evolves."
2501.11705,"This paper examines the responsible integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in human services organizations (HSOs), proposing a nuanced framework for evaluating AI applications across multiple dimensions of risk. The authors argue that ethical concerns about AI deployment -- including professional judgment displacement, environmental impact, model bias, and data laborer exploitation -- vary significantly based on implementation context and specific use cases. They challenge the binary view of AI adoption, demonstrating how different applications present varying levels of risk that can often be effectively managed through careful implementation strategies. The paper highlights promising solutions, such as local large language models, that can facilitate responsible AI integration while addressing common ethical concerns. The authors propose a dimensional risk assessment approach that considers factors like data sensitivity, professional oversight requirements, and potential impact on client wellbeing. They conclude by outlining a path forward that emphasizes empirical evaluation, starting with lower-risk applications and building evidence-based understanding through careful experimentation. This approach enables organizations to maintain high ethical standards while thoughtfully exploring how AI might enhance their capacity to serve clients and communities effectively."
2501.11714,"Research has increasingly explored the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) within the mental health domain to enhance both patient care and healthcare provider efficiency. Given that mental health challenges frequently emerge during early adolescence -- the critical years of high school and college -- investigating AI/ML-driven mental health solutions within the education domain is of paramount importance. Nevertheless, conventional AI/ML techniques follow a centralized model training architecture, which poses privacy risks due to the need for transferring students' sensitive data from institutions, universities, and clinics to central servers. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a solution to address these risks by enabling distributed model training while maintaining data privacy. Despite its potential, research on applying FL to analyze students' mental health remains limited. In this paper, we aim to address this limitation by proposing a roadmap for integrating FL into mental health data analysis within educational settings. We begin by providing an overview of mental health issues among students and reviewing existing studies where ML has been applied to address these challenges. Next, we examine broader applications of FL in the mental health domain to emphasize the lack of focus on educational contexts. Finally, we propose promising research directions focused on using FL to address mental health issues in the education sector, which entails discussing the synergies between the proposed directions with broader human-centered domains. By categorizing the proposed research directions into short- and long-term strategies and highlighting the unique challenges at each stage, we aim to encourage the development of privacy-conscious AI/ML-driven mental health solutions."
2501.12394,"Introduction: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), holds significant promise for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR). However, standardized reporting guidance for LLM-assisted research is lacking. This article introduces the ELEVATE GenAI framework and checklist - reporting guidelines specifically designed for HEOR studies involving LLMs.Methods: The framework was developed through a targeted literature review of existing reporting guidelines, AI evaluation frameworks, and expert input from the ISPOR Working Group on Generative AI. It comprises ten domains, including model characteristics, accuracy, reproducibility, and fairness and bias. The accompanying checklist translates the framework into actionable reporting items. To illustrate its use, the framework was applied to two published HEOR studies: one focused on systematic literature review tasks and the other on economic modeling.Results: The ELEVATE GenAI framework offers a comprehensive structure for reporting LLM-assisted HEOR research, while the checklist facilitates practical implementation. Its application to the two case studies demonstrates its relevance and usability across different HEOR contexts.Limitations: Although the framework provides robust reporting guidance, further empirical testing is needed to assess its validity, completeness, usability, as well as its generalizability across diverse HEOR use cases.Conclusion: The ELEVATE GenAI framework and checklist address a critical gap by offering structured guidance for transparent, accurate, and reproducible reporting of LLM-assisted HEOR research. Future work will focus on extensive testing and validation to support broader adoption and refinement."
2501.12405,"Much of the research focus on AI alignment seeks to align large language models and other foundation models to the context-less and generic values of helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty. Frontier model providers also strive to align their models with these values. In this paper, we motivate why we need to move beyond such a limited conception and propose three dimensions for doing so. The first scope of alignment is competence: knowledge, skills, or behaviors the model must possess to be useful for its intended purpose. The second scope of alignment is transience: either semantic or episodic depending on the context of use. The third scope of alignment is audience: either mass, public, small-group, or dyadic. At the end of the paper, we use the proposed framework to position some technologies and workflows that go beyond prevailing notions of alignment."
2501.12498,"Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have reopened the question about the boundaries of AI autonomy, particularly in discussions around artificial general intelligence and its potential to act independently across varied purposes. This paper explores these boundaries through the analysis of the Alignment Research Center experiment on GPT-4 and introduces the Start Button Problem, a thought experiment that examines the origins and limits of AI autonomy. By examining the thought experiment and its counterarguments, it becomes clear that in its need for human activation and purpose definition lies the AI's inherent dependency on human-initiated actions, challenging the assumption of AI as an intelligent agent. Finally, the paper addresses the implications of this dependency on human responsibility, questioning the measure of the extension of human responsibility when using AI systems."
2501.12544,"Systems interacting with humans, such as assistive robots or chatbots, are increasingly integrated into our society. To prevent these systems from causing social, legal, ethical, empathetic, or cultural (SLEEC) harms, normative requirements specify the permissible range of their behaviors. These requirements encompass both functional and non-functional aspects and are defined with respect to time. Typically, these requirements are specified by stakeholders from a broad range of fields, such as lawyers, ethicists, or philosophers, who may lack technical expertise. Because such stakeholders often have different goals, responsibilities, and objectives, ensuring that these requirements are well-formed is crucial. SLEEC DSL, a domain-specific language resembling natural language, has been developed to formalize these requirements as SLEEC rules. In this paper, we present LEGOS-SLEEC, a tool designed to support interdisciplinary stakeholders in specifying normative requirements as SLEEC rules, and in analyzing and debugging their well-formedness. LEGOS-SLEEC is built using four previously published components, which have been shown to be effective and usable across nine case studies. Reflecting on this experience, we have significantly improved the user interface of LEGOS-SLEEC and its diagnostic support, and demonstrate the effectiveness of these improvements using four interdisciplinary stakeholders.

2501.1261,"The Wikipedia editors' community has been actively pursuing the intent of achieving gender equality. To that end, it is important to explore the historical evolution of underlying gender disparities in Wikipedia articles. This paper presents the Wikipedia Gender Dashboard (WGD), a tool designed to enable the interaction with gender distribution data, including the average age in every subclass of individuals (i.e. Astronauts, Politicians, etc.) over the years. Wikipedia APIs, DBpedia, and Wikidata endpoints were used to query the data to ensure persistent data collection. The WGD was then created with Microsoft Power BI before being embedded on a public website. The analysis of the data available in the WGD found that female articles only represent around 17% of English Wikipedia, but it has been growing steadily over the last 20 years. Meanwhile, the average age across genders decreased over time. WGD also shows that most subclasses of `Person' are male-dominated. Wikipedia editors can make use of WGD to locate areas with marginalized genders in Wikipedia, and increase their efforts to produce more content providing coverage for those genders to achieve better gender equality in Wikipedia."
2501.12642,"This report investigates Training Data Attribution (TDA) and its potential importance to and tractability for reducing extreme risks from AI. First, we discuss the plausibility and amount of effort it would take to bring existing TDA research efforts from their current state, to an efficient and accurate tool for TDA inference that can be run on frontier-scale LLMs. Next, we discuss the numerous research benefits AI labs will expect to see from using such TDA tooling. Then, we discuss a key outstanding bottleneck that would limit such TDA tooling from being accessible publicly: AI labs' willingness to disclose their training data. We suggest ways AI labs may work around these limitations, and discuss the willingness of governments to mandate such access. Assuming that AI labs willingly provide access to TDA inference, we then discuss what high-level societal benefits you might see. We list and discuss a series of policies and systems that may be enabled by TDA. Finally, we present an evaluation of TDA's potential impact on mitigating large-scale risks from AI systems."
2501.12897,"Two modern trends in insurance are data-intensive underwriting and behavior-based insurance. Data-intensive underwriting means that insurers analyze more data for estimating the claim cost of a consumer and for determining the premium based on that estimation. Insurers also offer behavior-based insurance. For example, some car insurers use artificial intelligence (AI) to follow the driving behavior of an individual consumer in real-time and decide whether to offer that consumer a discount. In this paper, we report on a survey of the Dutch population (N=999) in which we asked people's opinions about examples of data-intensive underwriting and behavior-based insurance. The main results include: (i) If survey respondents find an insurance practice unfair, they also find the practice unacceptable. (ii) Respondents find almost all modern insurance practices that we described unfair. (iii) Respondents find practices for which they can influence the premium fairer. (iv) If respondents find a certain consumer characteristic illogical for basing the premium on, then respondents find using the characteristic unfair. (v) Respondents find it unfair if an insurer offers an insurance product only to a specific group. (vi) Respondents find it unfair if an insurance practice leads to the poor paying more. We also reflect on the policy implications of the findings."
2501.1306,"As computing's societal impact grows, so does the need for computing students to recognize and address the ethical and sociotechnical implications of their work. While there are efforts to integrate ethics into computing curricula, we lack a standardized tool to measure those efforts, specifically, students' attitudes towards ethical reflection and their ability to effect change. This paper introduces the novel framework of Critically Conscious Computing and reports on the development and content validation of the Critical Reflection and Agency in Computing Index, a novel instrument designed to assess undergraduate computing students' attitudes towards practicing critically conscious computing. The resulting index is a theoretically grounded, expert-reviewed tool to support research and practice in computing ethics education. This enables researchers and educators to gain insights into students' perspectives, inform the design of targeted ethics interventions, and measure the effectiveness of computing ethics education initiatives."
2501.13235,"Open data initiatives and infrastructures play an essential role in favoring better data access, participation, and transparency in government operations and decision-making. Open Geographical Data Infrastructures (OGDIs) allow citizens to access and scrutinize government and public data, thereby enhancing accountability and evidence-based decision-making. This encourages citizen engagement and participation in public affairs and offers researchers, non-governmental organizations, civil society, and business sectors novel opportunities to analyze and disseminate large amounts of geographical data and to address social, urban, and environmental challenges. In Latin America, while recent open government agendas have shown an inclination towards transparency, citizen participation, and collaboration, only a limited number of OGDIs allow unrestricted use and re-use of their data. Given the region's cultural, social, and economic disparities, there is a contrasting digital divide that significantly impacts how OGDIs are being developed. Therefore, this paper analyses recent progress in developing OGDIs in Latin America, technological gaps, and open geographical data initiatives. The main results denote an early development of OGDIs in the region. Nevertheless, this opens the door for the timely involvement of citizens and non-government sectors to share needs, experiences, knowledge, and expertise, as well as to address a transboundary research agenda. Challenges are discussed from multiple perspectives: data, methodological, governmental and readiness, and potential impact. This analysis is aimed at researchers, policymakers, and practitioners interested in the specific challenges and progress of OGDIs in Latin America, while also contributing to the global conversation on best practices and lessons learned in implementing OGDIs across different contexts."
2501.1332,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly integrated into various aspects of daily life, concerns about privacy and ethical accountability are gaining prominence. This study explores stakeholder perspectives on privacy in AI systems, focusing on educators, parents, and AI professionals. Using qualitative analysis of survey responses from 227 participants, the research identifies key privacy risks, including data breaches, ethical misuse, and excessive data collection, alongside perceived benefits such as personalized services, enhanced efficiency, and educational advancements. Stakeholders emphasized the need for transparency, privacy-by-design, user empowerment, and ethical oversight to address privacy concerns effectively. The findings provide actionable insights into balancing the benefits of AI with robust privacy protections, catering to the diverse needs of stakeholders. Recommendations include implementing selective data use, fostering transparency, promoting user autonomy, and integrating ethical principles into AI development. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on ethical AI, offering guidance for designing privacy-centric systems that align with societal values and build trust among users. By addressing privacy challenges, this research underscores the importance of developing AI technologies that are not only innovative but also ethically sound and responsive to the concerns of all stakeholders."
2501.13321,"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems into technologies used by young digital citizens raises significant privacy concerns. This study investigates these concerns through a comparative analysis of stakeholder perspectives. A total of 252 participants were surveyed, with the analysis focusing on 110 valid responses from parents/educators and 100 from AI professionals after data cleaning. Quantitative methods, including descriptive statistics and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, examined five validated constructs: Data Ownership and Control, Parental Data Sharing, Perceived Risks and Benefits, Transparency and Trust, and Education and Awareness. Results showed Education and Awareness significantly influenced data ownership and risk assessment, while Data Ownership and Control strongly impacted Transparency and Trust. Transparency and Trust, along with Perceived Risks and Benefits, showed minimal influence on Parental Data Sharing, suggesting other factors may play a larger role. The study underscores the need for user-centric privacy controls, tailored transparency strategies, and targeted educational initiatives. Incorporating diverse stakeholder perspectives offers actionable insights into ethical AI design and governance, balancing innovation with robust privacy protections to foster trust in a digital age."
2501.13802,"Climate misinformation is a problem that has the potential to be substantially aggravated by the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this study we evaluate the potential for LLMs to be part of the solution for mitigating online dis/misinformation rather than the problem. Employing a public expert annotated dataset and a curated sample of social media content we evaluate the performance of proprietary vs. open source LLMs on climate misinformation classification task, comparing them to existing climate-focused computer-assisted tools and expert assessments. Results show (1) open-source models substantially under-perform in classifying climate misinformation compared to proprietary models, (2) existing climate-focused computer-assisted tools leveraging expert-annotated datasets continues to outperform many of proprietary models, including GPT-4o, and (3) demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of fine-tuning GPT-3.5-turbo on expert annotated dataset in classifying claims about climate change at the equivalency of climate change experts with over 20 years of experience in climate communication. These findings highlight 1) the importance of incorporating human-oversight, such as incorporating expert-annotated datasets in training LLMs, for governance tasks that require subject-matter expertise like classifying climate misinformation, and 2) the potential for LLMs in facilitating civil society organizations to engage in various governance tasks such as classifying false or misleading claims in domains beyond climate change such as politics and health science."
2501.1404,"Emerging AI technologies have the potential to drive economic growth and innovation but can also pose significant risks to society. To mitigate these risks, governments, companies, and researchers have contributed regulatory frameworks, risk assessment approaches, and safety benchmarks, but these can lack nuance when considered in global deployment contexts. One way to understand these nuances is by looking at how the media reports on AI, as news media has a substantial influence on what negative impacts of AI are discussed in the public sphere and which impacts are deemed important. In this work, we analyze a broad and diverse sample of global news media spanning 27 countries across Asia, Africa, Europe, Middle East, North America, and Oceania to gain valuable insights into the risks and harms of AI technologies as reported and prioritized across media outlets in different countries. This approach reveals a skewed prioritization of Societal Risks followed by Legal & Rights-related Risks, Content Safety Risks, Cognitive Risks, Existential Risks, and Environmental Risks, as reflected in the prevalence of these risk categories in the news coverage of different nations. Furthermore, it highlights how the distribution of such concerns varies based on the political bias of news outlets, underscoring the political nature of AI risk assessment processes and public opinion. By incorporating views from various regions and political orientations for assessing the risks and harms of AI, this work presents stakeholders, such as AI developers and policy makers, with insights into the AI risks categories prioritized in the public sphere. These insights may guide the development of more inclusive, safe, and responsible AI technologies that address the diverse concerns and needs across the world."

These services can be implemented through a combination of mobile devices, applications, wearable sensors, and other smart technology. It is paramount to handle sensitive data that is collected in ways that meet users' privacy expectations. We surveyed 384 people in Canada aged 20 to 93 years old to explore participants' comfort with data collection, sharing preferences, and potential privacy concerns related to remote healthcare technology. We explore these topics within the context of various healthcare scenarios including health emergencies and managing chronic health conditions."
2501.14305,"Automated grading has become an essential tool in education technology due to its ability to efficiently assess large volumes of student work, provide consistent and unbiased evaluations, and deliver immediate feedback to enhance learning. However, current systems face significant limitations, including the need for large datasets in few-shot learning methods, a lack of personalized and actionable feedback, and an overemphasis on benchmark performance rather than student experience. To address these challenges, we propose a Zero-Shot Large Language Model (LLM)-Based Automated Assignment Grading (AAG) system. This framework leverages prompt engineering to evaluate both computational and explanatory student responses without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. The AAG system delivers tailored feedback that highlights individual strengths and areas for improvement, thereby enhancing student learning outcomes. Our study demonstrates the system's effectiveness through comprehensive evaluations, including survey responses from higher education students that indicate significant improvements in motivation, understanding, and preparedness compared to traditional grading methods. The results validate the AAG system's potential to transform educational assessment by prioritizing learning experiences and providing scalable, high-quality feedback."

2501.14748,"Global Majority users are exposed to multitudes of harm when interacting with online platforms. This essay illuminates how exploitation in the advances of Artificial Intelligence is tied to historical exploitation and how the use of blanket terminology overshadows the layers of exploitation and harm ``Global Majority'' populations face. It first discusses the multitude of harm content moderators from the Global Majority face, arguing against the current trend of protection through exploitation, then it illustrates the nuances and differences within the Global Majority, and finally, it outlines actionable items to move away from such harm."
2501.14749,"This paper examines the strategic dynamics of international competition to develop Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). We argue that the same assumptions that might motivate the US to race to develop ASI also imply that such a race is extremely dangerous. These assumptions--that ASI would provide a decisive military advantage and that states are rational actors prioritizing survival--imply that a race would heighten three critical risks: great power conflict, loss of control of ASI systems, and the undermining of liberal democracy. Our analysis shows that ASI presents a trust dilemma rather than a prisoners dilemma, suggesting that international cooperation to control ASI development is both preferable and strategically sound. We conclude that cooperation is achievable."
2501.1475,"Carbon emissions significantly contribute to climate change, and carbon credits have emerged as a key tool for mitigating environmental damage and helping organizations manage their carbon footprint.

2501.1476,"Our society is on the verge of a revolution powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. With increasing advancements in AI, there is a growing expansion in data centers (DCs) serving as critical infrastructure for this new wave of technologies. This technological wave is also on a collision course with exacerbating climate hazards which raises the need for evaluating the vulnerability of DCs to various hazards. Hence, the objective of this research is to conduct a nationwide vulnerability assessment of (DCs) in the United States of America (USA). DCs provide such support; however, if an unplanned disruption (like a natural hazard or power outage) occurs, the functionality of DCs are in jeopardy. Unplanned downtime in DCs cause severe economic and social repercussions. With the Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) test, the research found that there are a large percentage of DCs that are in non-vulnerable areas of disruption; however, there is still a notable percentage in disruption prone areas. For example, earthquakes, hurricanes, and tornadoes have the most DCs in vulnerable areas. After identifying these vulnerabilities, the research identified areas within the USA that have minimal vulnerabilities to both the aforementioned natural hazards and power outages with the BI-LISA test. After doing a composite vulnerability score on the Cold-Spots from the BILISA analysis, the research found three counties with the low vulnerability scores. These are Koochiching, Minnesota (0.091), Schoolcraft, Michigan (0.095), and Houghton, Michigan (0.096)."
2501.14761,"Transportation equity research has traditionally emphasized service accessibility and destination reachability while often overlooking the critical aspects of service quality, such as infrequent schedules or overcrowded vehicles. This oversight can lead to a skewed understanding of equity, as high accessibility does not guarantee high-quality service. Addressing this gap, we propose a transportation equity index called the multi-dimensional, high-granularity (MDHG) index. Such an index considers service accessibility and quality alongside population demographics. This approach ensures that areas with high accessibility but low service quality are recognized as inequitable. The MDHG Index addresses service performance by incorporating performance data with temporal variations based on actual trip data, thus offering a more nuanced view of transportation equity that reflects the real-world experiences of service users. Furthermore, to effectively identify and address the needs at the user level, we need to use a highly granular population dataset. Due to the low granularity of census and other open-source datasets, we opted to use a highly granular synthetic dataset. To test out the MDHG Index, we coupled a highly granular synthetic population dataset with data from NYC Citi Bike expansion to use as a case study to assess changes in accessibility and service quality before and after the expansion. The MDHG approach effectively identified areas that improved post-expansion and highlighted those requiring further enhancement, thus showing the effectiveness of the index in targeted improvements for transportation equity."
2501.14762,"The mission of resilience of Ukrainian cities calls for international collaboration with the scientific community to increase the quality of information by identifying and integrating information from various news and social media sources. Linked Data technology can be used to unify, enrich, and integrate data from multiple sources. In our work, we focus on datasets about damaging events in Ukraine due to Russia's invasion between February 2022 and the end of April 2023. We convert two selected datasets to Linked Data and enrich them with additional geospatial information. Following that, we present an algorithm for the detection of identical events from different datasets. Our pipeline makes it easy to convert and enrich datasets to integrated Linked Data. The resulting dataset consists of 10K reported events covering damage to hospitals, schools, roads, residential buildings, etc. Finally, we demonstrate in use cases how our dataset can be applied to different scenarios for resilience purposes."
2501.14764,"In the food industry, innovative packaging solutions are increasingly important for reducing food waste and for contributing to global sustainability efforts. However, current food packaging is generally passive and unable to adapt to changes in the food environment in real-time. To address this, we have developed a battery-less and autonomous smart packaging system that wirelessly powers closed-loop sensing and release of active compounds. This system integrates a gas sensor for real-time food monitoring, a Near-Field Communication (NFC) antenna, and a controlled release of active compounds to prevent quality deterioration in the complex food environment. We have demonstrated the ability of the developed smart packaging system, to continuously monitor the freshness of fish products and to trigger the release of active compounds when the food starts to spoil. The system was able to extend the shelf-life of the food product up to 14 days, due to the controlled release of antioxidant and antibacterial compounds. Our system could pave the way towards an Internet of Things solution that addresses protection, active prevention of food spoilage and sustainability, facing all the current challenges of the food packaging industry."

The results demonstrate that social media platforms can be effectively used as real-time situational awareness tools, delivering critical information to society and authorities during emergencies."
2501.14772,"Applying Large language models (LLMs) within specific domains requires substantial adaptation to account for the unique terminologies, nuances, and context-specific challenges inherent to those areas. Here, we introduce DropMicroFluidAgents (DMFAs), an advanced language-driven framework leveraging state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs. DMFAs employs LLM agents to perform two key functions: (1) delivering focused guidance, answers, and suggestions specific to droplet microfluidics and (2) generating machine learning models to optimise and automate the design of droplet microfluidic devices, including the creation of code-based computer-aided design (CAD) scripts to enable rapid and precise design execution. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that the integration of DMFAs with the LLAMA3.1 model yielded the highest accuracy of 76.15%, underscoring the significant performance enhancement provided by agent integration. This effect was particularly pronounced when DMFAs were paired with the GEMMA2 model, resulting in a 34.47% improvement in accuracy compared to the standalone GEMMA2 configuration. This study demonstrates the effective use of LLM agents in droplet microfluidics research as powerful tools for automating workflows, synthesising knowledge, optimising designs, and interacting with external systems. These capabilities enable their application across education and industrial support, driving greater efficiency in scientific discovery and innovation."

2501.14776,"AI is demanding an evergrowing portion of environmental resources. Despite their potential impact on AI environmental sustainability, the role that programming languages play in AI (in)efficiency is to date still unknown. With this study, we aim to understand the impact that programming languages can have on AI environmental sustainability. To achieve our goal, we conduct a controlled empirical experiment by considering five programming languages (C++, Java, Python, MATLAB, and R), seven AI algorithms (KNN, SVC, AdaBoost, decision tree, logistic regression, naive bayses, and random forest), three popular datasets, and the training and inference phases. The collected results show that programming languages have a considerable impact on AI environmental sustainability. Compiled and semi-compiled languages (C++, Java) consistently consume less than interpreted languages (Python, MATLAB, R), which require up to 54x more energy. Some languages are cumulatively more efficient in training, while others in inference. Which programming language consumes the most highly depends on the algorithm considered. Ultimately, algorithm implementation might be the most determining factor in Green AI, regardless of the language used. As conclusion, while making AI more environmentally sustainable is paramount, a trade-off between energy efficiency and implementation ease should always be considered. Green AI can be achieved without the need of completely disrupting the development practices and technologies currently in place."

2501.14779,"This study investigated the students' perceptions of using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in upper-secondary mathematics education. Data was collected from Finnish high school students to represent how key constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model (Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Enjoyment, and Intention to Use) influence the adoption of AI tools. First, a structural equation model for a comparative study with a prior study was constructed and analyzed. Then, an extended model with the additional construct of Compatibility, which represents the alignment of AI tools with students' educational experiences and needs, was proposed and analyzed. The results demonstrated a strong influence of perceived usefulness on the intention to use GenAI, emphasizing the statistically significant role of perceived enjoyment in determining perceived usefulness and ease of use. The inclusion of compatibility improved the model's explanatory power, particularly in predicting perceived usefulness. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how AI tools can be integrated into mathematics education and highlights key differences between the Finnish educational context and previous studies based on structural equation modeling."
2501.1478,"With the largest population of the world and one of the highest enrolments in higher education, India needs efficient and effective means to educate its learners. India started focusing on open and digital education in 1980's and its efforts were escalated in 2009 through the NMEICT program of the Government of India. A study by the Government and FICCI in 2014 noted that India cannot meet its educational needs just by capacity building in brick and mortar institutions. It was decided that ongoing MOOCs projects under the umbrella of NMEICT will be further strengthened over its second (2017-21) and third (2021-26) phases. NMEICT now steers NPTEL or SWAYAM (India's MOOCs) and several digital learning projects including Virtual Labs, e-Yantra, Spoken Tutorial, FOSSEE, and National Digital Library on India - the largest digital education library in the world. Further, India embraced its new National Education Policy in 2020 to strongly foster online education.

AI-powered MOOCs is an emerging opportunity for India to lead MOOCs worldwide."
2501.14886,"Equity is crucial to the ethical implications in technology development. However, implementing equity in practice comes with complexities and nuances. In response, the research community, especially the human-computer interaction (HCI) and Fairness community, has endeavored to integrate equity into technology design, addressing issues of societal inequities. With such increasing efforts, it is yet unclear why and how researchers discuss equity and its integration into technology, what research has been conducted, and what gaps need to be addressed. We conducted a systematic literature review on equity and technology, collecting and analyzing 202 papers published in HCI and Fairness-focused venues. Amidst the substantial growth of relevant publications within the past four years, we deliver three main contributions: (1) we elaborate a comprehensive understanding researchers' motivations for studying equity and technology, (2) we illustrate the different equity definitions and frameworks utilized to discuss equity, (3) we characterize the key themes addressing interventions as well as tensions and trade-offs when advancing and integrating equity to technology.

2501.15351,"Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generation and understanding, especially in simulating socio-political and economic patterns, serving as an alternative to traditional surveys. However, their global applicability remains questionable due to unexplored biases across socio-demographic and geographic contexts. This study examines how LLMs perform across diverse populations by analyzing public surveys from Chile and the United States, focusing on predictive accuracy and fairness metrics. The results show performance disparities, with LLM consistently outperforming on U.S. datasets. This bias originates from the U.S.-centric training data, remaining evident after accounting for socio-demographic differences. In the U.S., political identity and race significantly influence prediction accuracy, while in Chile, gender, education, and religious affiliation play more pronounced roles. Our study presents a novel framework for measuring socio-demographic biases in LLMs, offering a path toward ensuring fairer and more equitable model performance across diverse socio-cultural contexts."

However, no validated instrument exists to measure these specific perceptions. This paper presents the development and validation of the Artificial Intelligence and Sustainability Perceptions Inventory (AISPI), a novel 13-item instrument measuring how individuals view the relationship between AI advancement and environmental sustainability. Through factor analysis (N=105), we identified two distinct dimensions: Twin Transition and Competing Interests. The instrument demonstrated strong reliability (alpha=.89) and construct validity through correlations with established measures of AI and sustainability attitudes. Our findings suggest that individuals can simultaneously recognize both synergies and tensions in the AI-sustainability relationship, offering important implications for researchers and practitioners working at this critical intersection. This work provides a foundational tool for future research on public perceptions of AI's role in sustainable development."
2501.15634,"When selecting a model from a set of equally performant models, how much unfairness can you really reduce? Is it important to be intentional about fairness when choosing among this set, or is arbitrarily choosing among the set of ''good'' models good enough? Recent work has highlighted that the phenomenon of model multiplicity-where multiple models with nearly identical predictive accuracy exist for the same task-has both positive and negative implications for fairness, from strengthening the enforcement of civil rights law in AI systems to showcasing arbitrariness in AI decision-making. Despite the enormous implications of model multiplicity, there is little work that explores the properties of sets of equally accurate models, or Rashomon sets, in general. In this paper, we present five main theoretical and methodological contributions which help us to understand the relatively unexplored properties of the Rashomon set, in particular with regards to fairness. Our contributions include methods for efficiently sampling models from this set and techniques for identifying the fairest models according to key fairness metrics such as statistical parity. We also derive the probability that an individual's prediction will be flipped within the Rashomon set, as well as expressions for the set's size and the distribution of error tolerance used across models. These results lead to policy-relevant takeaways, such as the importance of intentionally looking for fair models within the Rashomon set, and understanding which individuals or groups may be more susceptible to arbitrary decisions."
2501.15678,"As the use of Generative AI (GenAI) tools becomes more prevalent in interpersonal communication, understanding their impact on social perceptions is crucial. According to signaling theory, GenAI may undermine the credibility of social signals conveyed in writing, since it reduces the cost of writing and makes it hard to verify the authenticity of messages. Using a pre-registered large-scale online experiment (N = 647; Prolific), featuring scenarios in a range of communication contexts (personal vs. professional; close others vs. strangers), we explored how senders' use of GenAI influenced recipients' impressions of senders, both when GenAI use was known or uncertain. Consistent with past work, we found strong negative effects on social impressions when disclosing that a message was AI-generated, compared to when the same message was human-written. However, under the more realistic condition when potential GenAI use was not explicitly highlighted, recipients did not exhibit any skepticism towards senders, and these ""uninformed"" impressions were virtually indistinguishable from those of fully human-written messages. Even when we highlighted the potential (but uncertain) use of GenAI, recipients formed overly positive impressions. These results are especially striking given that 46% of our sample admitted having used such tools for writing messages, just within the past two weeks. Our findings put past work in a new light: While social judgments can be substantially affected when GenAI use is explicitly disclosed, this information may not be readily available in more realistic communication settings, making recipients blissfully ignorant about others' potential use of GenAI."
2501.15985,"Artificial intelligence (AI) models are increasingly autonomous in decision-making, making pursuing responsible AI more critical than ever. Responsible AI (RAI) is defined by its commitment to transparency, privacy, safety, inclusiveness, and fairness. But while the principles of RAI are clear and shared, RAI practices and auditing mechanisms are still incipient. A key challenge is establishing metrics and benchmarks that define performance goals aligned with RAI principles. This paper describes how the ITACA AI auditing platform developed bythis http URLtackles demographic benchmarking when auditing AI recommender systems. To this end, we describe a Demographic Benchmarking Framework designed to measure the populations potentially impacted by specific AI models. The framework serves us as auditors as it allows us to not just measure but establish acceptability ranges for specific performance indicators, which we share with the developers of the systems we audit so they can build balanced training datasets and measure and monitor fairness throughout the AI lifecycle. It is also a valuable resource for policymakers in drafting effective and enforceable regulations. Our approach integrates socio-demographic insights directly into AI systems, reducing bias and improving overall performance. The main contributions of this study include:1. Defining control datasets tailored to specific demographics so they can be used in model training; 2. Comparing the overall population with those impacted by the deployed model to identify discrepancies and account for structural bias; and 3. Quantifying drift in different scenarios continuously and as a post-market monitoring mechanism."
2501.16461,"AI systems are increasingly tasked to complete responsibilities with decreasing oversight. This delegation requires users to accept certain risks, typically mitigated by perceived or actual alignment of values between humans and AI, leading to confidence that the system will act as intended. However, stochastic behavior by an AI system threatens to undermine alignment and potential trust. In this work, we take a philosophical perspective to the tension and potential conflict between stochasticity and trustworthiness. We demonstrate how stochasticity complicates traditional methods of establishing trust and evaluate two extant approaches to managing it: (1) eliminating user-facing stochasticity to create deterministic experiences, and (2) allowing users to independently control tolerances for stochasticity. We argue that both approaches are insufficient, as not all forms of stochasticity affect trustworthiness in the same way or to the same degree. Instead, we introduce a novel definition of stochasticity and propose latent value modeling for both AI systems and users to better assess alignment. This work lays a foundational step toward understanding how and when stochasticity impacts trustworthiness, enabling more precise trust calibration in complex AI systems, and underscoring the importance of sociotechnical analyses to effectively address these challenges."
2501.16494,"Young people are increasingly exposed to adverse effects of data-driven profiling, recommending, and manipulation on social media platforms, most of them without adequate understanding of the mechanisms that drive these platforms. In the context of computing education, educating learners about mechanisms and data practices of social media may improve young learners' data agency, digital literacy, and understanding how their digital services work. A four-hour technology -- supported intervention was designed and implemented in 12 schools involving 209 5th and 8th grade learners. Two new classroom apps were developed to support the classroom activities. Using Likert-scale questions borrowed from a data agency questionnaire and open-ended questions that mapped learners' data-driven reasoning on social media phenomena, this article shows significant improvement between pre- and post-tests in learners' data agency and data-driven explanations of social media mechanisms. Results present an example of improving young learners' understanding of social media mechanisms."

It subsequently argues that FSPs should evolve to a more granular version, which this paper calls FSPs Plus. Compared to the first wave of FSPs led by a subset of frontier AI companies, FSPs Plus should be built around two main pillars. First, FSPs Plus should adopt precursory capabilities as a new, clearer, and more comprehensive set of metrics. In this respect, this paper recommends that international or domestic standardization bodies develop a standardized taxonomy of precursory components to high-impact capabilities that FSPs Plus could then adopt by reference. The Frontier Model Forum could lead the way by establishing preliminary consensus amongst frontier AI developers on this topic. Second, FSPs Plus should expressly incorporate AI safety cases and establish a mutual feedback mechanism between FSPs Plus and AI safety cases. To establish such a mutual feedback mechanism, FSPs Plus could be updated to include a clear commitment to make AI safety cases at different milestones during development and deployment, to build and adopt safety measures based on the content and confidence of AI safety cases, and, also on this basis, to keep updating and adjusting FSPs Plus."
2501.16531,"Since 2022, generative AI (genAI) has rapidly become integrated into workplaces. Though organizations have made commitments to use this technology ""responsibly"", how organizations and their employees prioritize responsibility in their decision-making remains absent from extant management theorizing. In this paper, we examine how product managers - who often serve as gatekeepers in decision-making processes - implement responsible practices in their day-to-day work when using genAI. Using Institutional Theory, we illuminate the factors that constrain or support proactive responsible development and usage of genAI technologies. We employ a mixed methods research design, drawing on 25 interviews with product managers and a global survey of 300 respondents in product management-related roles. The majority of our respondents report (1) widespread uncertainty regarding what ""responsibility"" means or looks like, (2) diffused responsibility given assumed ethical actions by other teams, (3) lack of clear incentives and guidance within organizations, and (4) the importance of leadership buy-in and principles for navigating tensions between ethical commitments and profit motives. However, our study finds that even in highly uncertain environments, absent guidance from leadership, product managers can ""recouple"" ethical commitments and practices by finding responsibility ""micro-moments"". Product managers seek out low-risk, small-scale actions they can take without explicit buy-in from higher-level managers, such as individual or team-wide checks and reviews and safeguarding standards for data. Our research highlights how genAI poses unique challenges to organizations trying to couple ethical principles and daily practices and the role that middle-level management can play in recoupling the two."
2501.16548,"As the climate crisis deepens, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a contested force: some champion its potential to advance renewable energy, materials discovery, and large-scale emissions monitoring, while others underscore its growing carbon footprint, water consumption, and material resource demands. Much of this debate has concentrated on direct impacts -- energy and water usage in data centers, e-waste from frequent hardware upgrades -- without addressing the significant indirect effects. This paper examines how the problem of Jevons' Paradox applies to AI, whereby efficiency gains may paradoxically spur increased consumption. We argue that understanding these second-order impacts requires an interdisciplinary approach, combining lifecycle assessments with socio-economic analyses. Rebound effects undermine the assumption that improved technical efficiency alone will ensure net reductions in environmental harm. Instead, the trajectory of AI's impact also hinges on business incentives and market logics, governance and policymaking, and broader social and cultural norms. We contend that a narrow focus on direct emissions misrepresents AI's true climate footprint, limiting the scope for meaningful interventions. We conclude with recommendations that address rebound effects and challenge the market-driven imperatives fueling uncontrolled AI growth. By broadening the analysis to include both direct and indirect consequences, we aim to inform a more comprehensive, evidence-based dialogue on AI's role in the climate crisis."
2501.16549,"Many machine learning applications predict individual probabilities, such as the likelihood that a person develops a particular illness. Since these probabilities are unknown, a key question is how to address situations in which different models trained on the same dataset produce varying predictions for certain individuals. This issue is exemplified by the model multiplicity (MM) phenomenon, where a set of comparable models yield inconsistent predictions. Roth, Tolbert, and Weinstein recently introduced a reconciliation procedure, the Reconcile algorithm, to address this problem. Given two disagreeing models, the algorithm leverages their disagreement to falsify and improve at least one of the models. In this paper, we empirically analyze the Reconcile algorithm using five widely-used fairness datasets: COMPAS, Communities and Crime, Adult, Statlog (German Credit Data), and the ACS Dataset. We examine how Reconcile fits within the model multiplicity literature and compare it to existing MM solutions, demonstrating its effectiveness. We also discuss potential improvements to the Reconcile algorithm theoretically and practically. Finally, we extend the Reconcile algorithm to the setting of causal inference, given that different competing estimators can again disagree on specific causal average treatment effect (CATE) values. We present the first extension of the Reconcile algorithm in causal inference, analyze its theoretical properties, and conduct empirical tests. Our results confirm the practical effectiveness of Reconcile and its applicability across various domains."
2501.16901,"The rapid evolution of technology in educational settings has opened new avenues for enhancing learning experiences, particularly in specialized fields like network management. This paper explores the novel integration of a GenAI-based virtual assistant in a university-level network management course, focusing on its impact on developing students' soft skills, notably critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Recognizing the increasing importance of these skills in the digital age, our study aims to assess the empirical effectiveness of this artificial intelligence-driven educational tool in fostering these competencies among students."
2501.16946,"This paper examines the systemic risks posed by incremental advancements in artificial intelligence, developing the concept of `gradual disempowerment', in contrast to the abrupt takeover scenarios commonly discussed in AI safety. We analyze how even incremental improvements in AI capabilities can undermine human influence over large-scale systems that society depends on, including the economy, culture, and nation-states. As AI increasingly replaces human labor and cognition in these domains, it can weaken both explicit human control mechanisms (like voting and consumer choice) and the implicit alignments with human interests that often arise from societal systems' reliance on human participation to function. Furthermore, to the extent that these systems incentivise outcomes that do not line up with human preferences, AIs may optimize for those outcomes more aggressively. These effects may be mutually reinforcing across different domains: economic power shapes cultural narratives and political decisions, while cultural shifts alter economic and political behavior. We argue that this dynamic could lead to an effectively irreversible loss of human influence over crucial societal systems, precipitating an existential catastrophe through the permanent disempowerment of humanity. This suggests the need for both technical research and governance approaches that specifically address the risk of incremental erosion of human influence across interconnected societal systems."
2501.16954,"Artificial intelligence (AI) ethics has gained significant momentum, evidenced by the growing body of published literature, policy guidelines, and public discourse. However, the practical implementation and adoption of AI ethics principles among practitioners has not kept pace with this theoretical development. Common barriers to adoption include overly abstract language, poor accessibility, and insufficient practical guidance for implementation. Through participatory design with industry practitioners, we developed an open-source tool that bridges this gap. Our tool is firmly grounded in normative ethical frameworks while offering concrete, actionable guidance in an intuitive format that aligns with established software development workflows. We validated this approach through a proof of concept study in the United States autonomous driving industry."
2501.17037,"The rapid deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in critical digital infrastructure introduces significant risks, necessitating a robust framework for systematically collecting AI incident data to prevent future incidents. Existing databases lack the granularity as well as the standardized structure required for consistent data collection and analysis, impeding effective incident management. This work proposes a standardized schema and taxonomy for AI incident databases, addressing these challenges by enabling detailed and structured documentation of AI incidents across sectors. Key contributions include developing a unified schema, introducing new fields such as incident severity, causes, and harms caused, and proposing a taxonomy for classifying AI incidents in critical digital infrastructure. The proposed solution facilitates more effective incident data collection and analysis, thus supporting evidence-based policymaking, enhancing industry safety measures, and promoting transparency. This work lays the foundation for a coordinated global response to AI incidents, ensuring trust, safety, and accountability in using AI across regions."
2501.17176,"The dream of achieving a student-teacher ratio of 1:1 is closer than ever thanks to the emergence of large language models (LLMs). One potential application of these models in the educational field would be to provide feedback to students in university introductory programming courses, so that a student struggling to solve a basic implementation problem could seek help from an LLM available 24/7. This article focuses on studying three aspects related to such an application. First, the performance of two well-known models, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4T, in providing feedback to students is evaluated. The empirical results showed that GPT-4T performs much better than GPT-3.5T, however, it is not yet ready for use in a real-world scenario. This is due to the possibility of generating incorrect information that potential users may not always be able to detect. Second, the article proposes a carefully designed prompt using in-context learning techniques that allows automating important parts of the evaluation process, as well as providing a lower bound for the fraction of feedbacks containing incorrect information, saving time and effort. This was possible because the resulting feedback has a programmatically analyzable structure that incorporates diagnostic information about the LLM's performance in solving the requested task. Third, the article also suggests a possible strategy for implementing a practical learning tool based on LLMs, which is rooted on the proposed prompting techniques. This strategy opens up a whole range of interesting possibilities from a pedagogical perspective."
2501.17278,"Programming, which is both economically significant and mentally stimulating, has been found to benefit the aging brain and to enhance cognitive function at various educational levels. Despite its advantages, challenges persist in standardizing and implementing programming education effectively across both the higher and secondary education levels in Brazil. To shed light on these issues, we carried out a systematic review of programming teaching methods in the Brazilian context, examining gaps, common techniques, approaches, and action opportunities in programming education. Our findings provide valuable recommendations for educational policymakers and educators to develop effective and updated national policies to teach programming."
2501.17805,"The first International AI Safety Report comprehensively synthesizes the current evidence on the capabilities, risks, and safety of advanced AI systems. The report was mandated by the nations attending the AI Safety Summit in Bletchley, UK. Thirty nations, the UN, the OECD, and the EU each nominated a representative to the report's Expert Advisory Panel. A total of 100 AI experts contributed, representing diverse perspectives and disciplines. Led by the report's Chair, these independent experts collectively had full discretion over the report's content."
2501.17899,"This paper proposes a Right to AI, which asserts that individuals and communities should meaningfully participate in the development and governance of the AI systems that shape their lives. Motivated by the increasing deployment of AI in critical domains and inspired by Henri Lefebvre's concept of the Right to the City, we reconceptualize AI as a societal infrastructure, rather than merely a product of expert design. In this paper, we critically evaluate how generative agents, large-scale data extraction, and diverse cultural values bring new complexities to AI oversight. The paper proposes that grassroots participatory methodologies can mitigate biased outcomes and enhance social responsiveness. It asserts that data is socially produced and should be managed and owned collectively. Drawing on Sherry Arnstein's Ladder of Citizen Participation and analyzing nine case studies, the paper develops a four-tier model for the Right to AI that situates the current paradigm and envisions an aspirational future. It proposes recommendations for inclusive data ownership, transparent design processes, and stakeholder-driven oversight. We also discuss market-led and state-centric alternatives and argue that participatory approaches offer a better balance between technical efficiency and democratic legitimacy."
2501.17942,"As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into educational technology, their potential to assist in developing curricula has gained interest among educators. Despite this growing attention, their applicability in culturally responsive Indigenous educational settings like Hawai`i's public schools and Kaiapuni (immersion language) programs, remains understudied. Additionally, `Olelo Hawai`i, the Hawaiian language, as a low-resource language, poses unique challenges and concerns about cultural sensitivity and the reliability of generated content. Through surveys and interviews with kumu (educators), this study explores the perceived benefits and limitations of using LLMs for culturally revitalizing computer science (CS) education in Hawaiian public schools with Kaiapuni programs. Our findings highlight AI's time-saving advantages while exposing challenges such as cultural misalignment and reliability concerns. We conclude with design recommendations for future AI tools to better align with Hawaiian cultural values and pedagogical practices, towards the broader goal of trustworthy, effective, and culturally grounded AI technologies."
2501.17962,"The agricultural industry is undergoing a significant transformation with the increasing adoption of autonomous technologies. Addressing complex challenges related to safety and security, components and validation procedures, and liability distribution is essential to facilitate the adoption of autonomous technologies. This paper explores the collaborative groups and initiatives undertaken to address these challenges. These groups investigate inter alia three focal topics: 1) describe the functional architecture of the operational range, 2) define the work context, i.e., the realistic scenarios that emerge in various agricultural applications, and 3) the static and dynamic detection cases that need to be detected by sensor sets. Linked by the Agricultural Operational Design Domain (Agri-ODD), use case descriptions, risk analysis, and questions of liability can be handled. By providing an overview of these collaborative initiatives, this paper aims to highlight the joint development of autonomous agricultural systems that enhance the overall efficiency of farming operations."
2501.1798,"The accelerating development and deployment of AI technologies depend on the continued ability to scale their infrastructure. This has implied increasing amounts of monetary investment and natural resources. Frontier AI applications have thus resulted in rising financial, environmental, and social costs. While the factors that AI scaling depends on reach its limits, the push for its accelerated advancement and entrenchment continues. In this paper, we provide a holistic review of AI scaling using four lenses (technical, economic, ecological, and social) and review the relationships between these lenses to explore the dynamics of AI growth. We do so by drawing on system dynamics concepts including archetypes such as ""limits to growth"" to model the dynamic complexity of AI scaling and synthesize several perspectives. Our work maps out the entangled relationships between the technical, economic, ecological and social perspectives and the apparent limits to growth. The analysis explains how industry's responses to external limits enables continued (but temporary) scaling and how this benefits Big Tech while externalizing social and environmental damages. To avoid an ""overshoot and collapse"" trajectory, we advocate for realigning priorities and norms around scaling to prioritize sustainable and mindful advancements."
2501.18038,"Acceleration ethics addresses the tension between innovation and safety in artificial intelligence. The acceleration argument is that risks raised by innovation should be answered with still more innovating. This paper summarizes the theoretical position, and then shows how acceleration ethics works in a real case. To begin, the paper summarizes acceleration ethics as composed of five elements: innovation solves innovation problems, innovation is intrinsically valuable, the unknown is encouraging, governance is decentralized, ethics is embedded. Subsequently, the paper illustrates the acceleration framework with a use-case, a generative artificial intelligence language tool developed by the Canadian telecommunications company Telus. While the purity of theoretical positions is blurred by real-world ambiguities, the Telus experience indicates that acceleration AI ethics is a way of maximizing social responsibility through innovation, as opposed to sacrificing social responsibility for innovation, or sacrificing innovation for social responsibility."
2501.18045,"How has the public responded to the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies? We investigate public perceptions of AI by collecting over 12,000 responses over 12 months from a nationally representative U.S. sample. Participants provided open-ended metaphors reflecting their mental models of AI, a methodology that overcomes the limitations of traditional self-reported measures by capturing more nuance. Using a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative clustering and qualitative coding, we identify 20 dominant metaphors shaping public understanding of AI. To analyze these metaphors systematically, we present a scalable framework integrating language modeling (LM)-based techniques to measure key dimensions of public perception: anthropomorphism (attribution of human-like qualities), warmth, and competence. We find that Americans generally view AI as warm and competent, and that over the past year, perceptions of AI's human-likeness and warmth have significantly increased ($+34\%, r = 0.80, p < 0.01; +41\%, r = 0.62, p < 0.05$). These implicit perceptions, along with the identified dominant metaphors, strongly predict trust in and willingness to adopt AI ($r^2 = 0.21, 0.18, p < 0.001$). Moreover, we uncover systematic demographic differences in metaphors and implicit perceptions, such as the higher propensity of women, older individuals, and people of color to anthropomorphize AI, which shed light on demographic disparities in trust and adoption. In addition to our dataset and framework for tracking evolving public attitudes, we provide actionable insights on using metaphors for inclusive and responsible AI development."
2501.18441,"This paper examines how social media algorithms and filter bubbles contribute to the fragmentation of online discourse, fostering ideological divides and undermining shared understanding. Drawing on Michael Sandels philosophical emphasis on community and shared values, the study explores how digital platforms amplify discrimination discourse including sexism, racism, xenophobia, ableism, homophobia, and religious intolerance during periods of heightened societal tension. By analyzing the dynamics of digital communities, the research highlights mechanisms driving the emergence and evolution of discourse fragments in response to real world events. The findings reveal how social media structures exacerbate polarization, restrict cross group dialogue, and erode the collective reasoning essential for a just society. This study situates philosophical perspectives within a computational analysis of social media interactions, offering a nuanced understanding of the challenges posed by fragmented discourse in the digital age."
2501.1891,"RegTech is a rapidly rising financial services sector focused on using cutting-edge technology to improve the process of regulatory compliance. RegTech solutions are characterized by numerous features and benefits that can considerably contribute to helping organizations operate effectively in the increasingly regulated environment, when it comes to compliance and risk management. This paper sheds light on why RegTech will be one of the most promising markets, driven by the rising cost of compliance and the growing reliance on technology in crisis management. Moreover, this paper will examine the advantages of using such solutions to strike a balance between compliance and operational efficiencies. This paper will deepen the understanding of regulatory compliance, introduce RegTech, and examine the benefits of using these solutions to achieve compliance."
2501.18986,"Computer science (CS) is increasingly becoming part of the curricula of K-12 education in different countries. However, there are few K-12 CS teachers, and tools to offer K-12 CS education are often limited. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) might help to temporarily address these challenges, and enable more schools to offer CS education. The goal of this systematic review is to give an overview of how CS MOOCs have been used in K-12 education. Nineteen papers from 2014 to May 2024 were included, describing thirteen different MOOCs. This review summarizes the research performed with these MOOCs and discusses directions for future research. Our findings show that most CS MOOCs target only part of the CS curriculum. When using a MOOC, a classroom teacher has an important role in supporting and managing students as they work in the MOOC. Research evaluating MOOCs is diverse, both in aims and in methods. In conclusion, MOOCs can play a valuable role in K-12 CS education, although additional teacher training to support students might be required. Moreover, additional learning material is needed to cover the full curriculum, as most MOOCs focus on programming and computational thinking."
2501.19173,"Machine learning community is discovering Contextual Integrity (CI) as a useful framework to assess the privacy implications of large language models (LLMs). This is an encouraging development. The CI theory emphasizes sharing information in accordance with privacy norms and can bridge the social, legal, political, and technical aspects essential for evaluating privacy in LLMs. However, this is also a good point to reflect on use of CI for LLMs. This position paper argues that existing literature inadequately applies CI for LLMs without embracing the theory's fundamental tenets.Inadequate applications of CI could lead to incorrect conclusions and flawed privacy-preserving designs. We clarify the four fundamental tenets of CI theory, systematize prior work on whether they deviate from these tenets, and highlight overlooked issues in experimental hygiene for LLMs (e.g., prompt sensitivity, positional bias)."
2501.19231,"Fair access to healthcare facilities is fundamental to achieving social equity. Traditional travel time-based accessibility measures often overlook the dynamic nature of travel times resulting from different departure times, which compromises the accuracy of these measures in reflecting the true accessibility experienced by individuals. This study examines public transport-based accessibility to healthcare facilities across England from the perspective of travel time variability (TTV). Using comprehensive bus timetable data from the Bus Open Data Service (BODS), we calculated hourly travel times from each Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) to the nearest hospitals and general practices and developed a TTV metric for each LSOA and analysed its geographical inequalities across various spatial scales. Our analysis reveals notable spatial-temporal patterns of TTV and average travel times, including an urban-rural divide, clustering of high and low TTV regions, and distinct outliers. Furthermore, we explored the relationship between TTV and deprivation, categorising LSOAs into four groups based on their unique characteristics, which provides valuable insights for designing targeted interventions. Our study also highlights the limitations of using theoretical TTV derived from timetable data and emphasises the potential of using real-time operational data to capture more realistic accessibility measures. By offering a more dynamic perspective on accessibility, our findings complement existing travel time-based metrics and pave way for future research on TTV-based accessibility using real-time data. This evidence-based approach can inform efforts to ""level up"" public transport services, addressing geographical inequalities and promoting equitable access to essential healthcare services."
2501.19275,"The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, such as Large Language Models, has introduced new possibilities for Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA), offering both opportunities and challenges. To help navigate the responsible integration of AI into QDA, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers experienced in QDA. While our participants were open to AI support in their QDA workflows, they expressed concerns about data privacy, autonomy, and the quality of AI outputs. In response, we developed a framework that spans from minimal to high AI involvement, providing tangible scenarios for integrating AI into QDA practices while addressing researchers' needs and concerns. Aligned with real-life QDA workflows, we identify potential for AI tools in areas such as data pre-processing, researcher onboarding, or conflict mediation. Our framework aims to provoke further discussion on the development of AI-supported QDA and to help establish community standards for responsible Human-AI collaboration."
2501.19334,"Machine learning is increasingly used in government programs to identify and support the most vulnerable individuals, prioritizing assistance for those at greatest risk over optimizing aggregate outcomes. This paper examines the welfare impacts of prediction in equity-driven contexts, and how they compare to other policy levers, such as expanding bureaucratic capacity. Through mathematical models and a real-world case study on long-term unemployment amongst German residents, we develop a comprehensive understanding of the relative effectiveness of prediction in surfacing the worst-off. Our findings provide clear analytical frameworks and practical, data-driven tools that empower policymakers to make principled decisions when designing these systems."
2501.19361,"Numerous powerful large language models (LLMs) are now available for use as writing support tools, idea generators, and beyond. Although these LLMs are marketed as helpful creative assistants, several works have shown that using an LLM as a creative partner results in a narrower set of creative outputs. However, these studies only consider the effects of interacting with a single LLM, begging the question of whether such narrowed creativity stems from using a particular LLM -- which arguably has a limited range of outputs -- or from using LLMs in general as creative assistants. To study this question, we elicit creative responses from humans and a broad set of LLMs using standardized creativity tests and compare the population-level diversity of responses. We find that LLM responses are much more similar to other LLM responses than human responses are to each other, even after controlling for response structure and other key variables. This finding of significant homogeneity in creative outputs across the LLMs we evaluate adds a new dimension to the ongoing conversation about creativity and LLMs. If today's LLMs behave similarly, using them as a creative partners -- regardless of the model used -- may drive all users towards a limited set of ""creative"" outputs."
2501.19407,"Surnames often convey implicit markers of social status, wealth, and lineage, shaping perceptions in ways that can perpetuate systemic biases and intergenerational inequality. This study is the first of its kind to investigate whether and how surnames influence AI-driven decision-making, focusing on their effects across key areas such as hiring recommendations, leadership appointments, and loan approvals. Using 72,000 evaluations of 600 surnames from the United States and Thailand, two countries with distinct sociohistorical contexts and surname conventions, we classify names into four categories: Rich, Legacy, Normal, and phonetically similar Variant groups. Our findings show that elite surnames consistently increase AI-generated perceptions of power, intelligence, and wealth, which in turn influence AI-driven decisions in high-stakes contexts. Mediation analysis reveals perceived intelligence as a key mechanism through which surname biases influence AI decision-making process. While providing objective qualifications alongside surnames mitigates most of these biases, it does not eliminate them entirely, especially in contexts where candidate credentials are low. These findings highlight the need for fairness-aware algorithms and robust policy measures to prevent AI systems from reinforcing systemic inequalities tied to surnames, an often-overlooked bias compared to more salient characteristics such as race and gender. Our work calls for a critical reassessment of algorithmic accountability and its broader societal impact, particularly in systems designed to uphold meritocratic principles while counteracting the perpetuation of intergenerational privilege."
2502.00002,"Purpose: This systematic literature review (SLR) characterizes the current state of the art on digital twinning (DT) technology in tourism-related applications. We aim to evaluate the types of DTs described in the literature, identifying their purposes, the areas of tourism where they have been proposed, their main components, and possible future directions based on current work.Design/methodology/approach: We conducted this SLR with bibliometric analysis based on an existing, validated methodology. Thirty-four peer-reviewed studies from three major scientific databases were selected for review. They were categorized using a taxonomy that included tourism type, purpose, spatial scale, data sources, data linkage, visualization, and application.Findings: The topic is at an early, evolving stage, as the oldest study found dates back to 2021. Most reviewed studies deal with cultural tourism, focusing on digitising cultural heritage. Destination management is the primary purpose of these DTs, with mainly site-level spatial scales. In many studies, the physical-digital data linkage is unilateral, lacking twin synchronization. In most DTs considered bilateral, the linkage is indirect. There are more applied than theoretical studies, suggesting progress in applying DTs in the field. Finally, there is an extensive research gap regarding DT technology in tourism, which is worth filling.Originality/Value: This paper presents a novel SLR with a bibliometric analysis of DTs' applied and theoretical application in tourism. Each reviewed publication is assessed and characterized, identifying the current state of the topic, possible research gaps, and future directions."
2502.00003,"Existing legal frameworks on AI rely on training compute thresholds as a proxy to identify potentially-dangerous AI models and trigger increased regulatory attention. In the United States, Section 4.2(a) of Executive Order 14110 instructs the Secretary of Commerce to require extensive reporting from developers of AI models above a certain training compute threshold. In the European Union, Article 51 of the AI Act establishes a presumption that AI models above a certain compute threshold have high impact capabilities and hence pose systemic risk, thus subjecting their developers to several obligations including capability evaluations, reporting, and incident monitoring. In this paper, we examine some enhancement techniques that are capable of decreasing training compute usage while preserving, or even increasing, model capabilities. Since training compute thresholds rely on training compute as a metric and trigger for increased regulatory attention, these capability-enhancing and compute-saving techniques could constitute a legal loophole to existing training compute thresholds. In particular, we concentrate on four illustrative techniques (fine-tuning, model reuse, model expansion, and above compute-optimal inference compute) with the goal of furthering the conversation about their implications on training compute thresholds as a legal mechanism and advancing policy recommendations that could address the relevant legal loopholes."
2502.00004,"Previous studies have shown that enhanced student assessment literacy can lead to improvements in academic performance in EFL (English as a Foreign Language) writing. Additionally, psychological factors such as self-efficacy, achievement motivation, and writing anxiety significantly influence EFL writing outcomes. However, the relationship between student writing assessment literacy (SWAL) and these psychological factors remains unclear. The present study aims to explore how SWAL affects psychological factors in the Chinese EFL context. Data were collected from 103 Chinese undergraduate EFL students using four questionnaires: the Student Writing Assessment Literacy Scale (SWAL), the Self-Efficacy for Writing Scale (SEWS), the Achievement Goal Questionnaire (AGQ), and the Second Language Writing Anxiety Inventory (SLWAI). Ordinal logistic regression was employed to analyze the data. The results indicated that higher levels of SWAL were positively associated with writing self-efficacy and achievement motivation, while negatively related to writing anxiety. These findings have significant pedagogical implications for second language (L2) writing instructions, emphasizing the importance of integrating SWAL training into writing instruction to enhance students' writing experiences and outcomes."
2502.00006,"This study aims to investigate the factors influencing the Human Development Index (HDI). Five variables-GDP per capita, health expenditure, education expenditure, infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births), and average years of schooling-were analyzed to develop a regression model assessing their impact on HDI. The results indicate that GDP per capita, infant mortality rate, and average years of schooling are significant predictors of HDI. Specifically, the study finds a positive relationship between GDP per capita and average years of schooling with HDI, while infant mortality rate is negatively associated with HDI."
2502.00007,"The Dead Internet Theory (DIT) suggests that much of today's internet, particularly social media, is dominated by non-human activity, AI-generated content, and corporate agendas, leading to a decline in authentic human interaction. This study explores the origins, core claims, and implications of DIT, emphasizing its relevance in the context of social media platforms. The theory emerged as a response to the perceived homogenization of online spaces, highlighting issues like the proliferation of bots, algorithmically generated content, and the prioritization of engagement metrics over genuine user interaction. AI technologies play a central role in this phenomenon, as social media platforms increasingly use algorithms and machine learning to curate content, drive engagement, and maximize advertising revenue. While these tools enhance scalability and personalization, they also prioritize virality and consumption over authentic communication, contributing to the erosion of trust, the loss of content diversity, and a dehumanized internet experience. This study redefines DIT in the context of social media, proposing that the commodification of content consumption for revenue has taken precedence over meaningful human connectivity. By focusing on engagement metrics, platforms foster a sense of artificiality and disconnection, underscoring the need for human-centric approaches to revive authentic online interaction and community building."
2502.00008,"Cities are at the forefront of addressing global sustainability challenges, particularly those exacerbated by climate change. Traditional zoning codes, which often segregate land uses, have been linked to increased vehicular dependence, urban sprawl, and social disconnection, undermining broader social and environmental sustainability objectives. This study investigates the adoption and impact of form-based codes (FBCs), which aim to promote sustainable, compact, and mixed-use urban forms as a solution to these issues. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we analyzed zoning documents from over 2000 U.S. census-designated places to identify linguistic patterns indicative of FBC principles. Our findings reveal widespread adoption of FBCs across the country, with notable variations within regions. FBCs are associated with higher floor-to-area ratios, narrower and more consistent street setbacks, and smaller plots. We also find that places with FBCs have improved walkability, shorter commutes, and a higher share of multi-family housing. Our findings highlight the utility of NLP for evaluating zoning codes and underscore the potential benefits of form-based zoning reforms for enhancing urban sustainability."
2502.00009,"This paper presents the AI Enabled Individual Entrepreneurship Theory (AIET), a theoretical framework explaining how artificial intelligence technologies transform individual entrepreneurial capability. The theory identifies two foundational premises: knowledge democratization and resource requirements evolution. Through three core mechanisms skill augmentation, capital structure transformation, and risk profile modification AIET explains how individuals can now undertake entrepreneurial activities at scales previously requiring significant organizational infrastructure. The theory presents five testable propositions addressing the changing relationship between organizational size and competitive advantage, the expansion of individual entrepreneurial capacity, the transformation of market entry barriers, the evolution of traditional firm advantages, and the modification of entrepreneurial risk profiles. Boundary conditions related to task characteristics and market conditions define the theory's scope and applicability. The framework suggests significant implications for entrepreneurship theory, organizational design, and market structure as AI capabilities continue to advance. This theory provides a foundation for understanding the evolving landscape of entrepreneurship in an AI-enabled world."
2502.0001,"With the continuous advancement of educational technology, the demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent educational agents in providing personalized learning experiences is rapidly increasing. This study aims to explore how to optimize the design and collaboration of a multi-agent system tailored for Socratic teaching through the integration of LLMs and knowledge graphs in a chain-of-thought dialogue approach, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of educational applications. By incorporating knowledge graphs, this research has bolstered the capability of LLMs to handle specific educational content, ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the information provided. Concurrently, we have focused on developing an effective multi-agent collaboration mechanism to facilitate efficient information exchange and chain dialogues among intelligent agents, significantly improving the quality of educational interaction and learning outcomes. In empirical research within the domain of mathematics education, this framework has demonstrated notable advantages in enhancing the accuracy and credibility of educational interactions. This study not only showcases the potential application of LLMs and knowledge graphs in mathematics teaching but also provides valuable insights and methodologies for the development of future AI-driven educational solutions."
2502.00011,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize various sectors, from healthcare to finance, education, and beyond. However, successfully implementing AI systems remains a complex challenge, requiring a comprehensive and methodologically sound framework. This paper contributes to this challenge by introducing the Trustworthy, Optimized, Adaptable, and Socio-Technologically harmonious (TOAST) framework. It draws on insights from various disciplines to align technical strategy with ethical values, societal responsibilities, and innovation aspirations. The TOAST framework is a novel approach designed to guide the implementation of AI systems, focusing on reliability, accountability, technical advancement, adaptability, and socio-technical harmony. By grounding the TOAST framework in healthcare case studies, this paper provides a robust evaluation of its practicality and theoretical soundness in addressing operational, ethical, and regulatory challenges in high-stakes environments, demonstrating how adaptable AI systems can enhance institutional efficiency, mitigate risks like bias and data privacy, and offer a replicable model for other sectors requiring ethically aligned and efficient AI integration."
2502.00012,"The study of complex adaptive systems, pioneered in physics, biology, and the social sciences, offers important lessons for AI governance. Contemporary AI systems and the environments in which they operate exhibit many of the properties characteristic of complex systems, including nonlinear growth patterns, emergent phenomena, and cascading effects that can lead to tail risks. Complexity theory can help illuminate the features of AI that pose central challenges for policymakers, such as feedback loops induced by training AI models on synthetic data and the interconnectedness between AI systems and critical infrastructure. Drawing on insights from other domains shaped by complex systems, including public health and climate change, we examine how efforts to govern AI are marked by deep uncertainty. To contend with this challenge, we propose a set of complexity-compatible principles concerning the timing and structure of AI governance, and the risk thresholds that should trigger regulatory intervention."
2502.00013,"Behavioural analytics provides insights into individual and crowd behaviour, enabling analysis of what previously happened and predictions for how people may be likely to act in the future. In defence and security, this analysis allows organisations to achieve tactical and strategic advantage through influence campaigns, a key counterpart to physical activities. Before action can be taken, online and real-world behaviour must be analysed to determine the level of threat. Huge data volumes mean that automated processes are required to attain an accurate understanding of risk. We describe the mathematical basis of technologies to analyse quotes in multiple languages. These include a Bayesian network to understand behavioural factors, state estimation algorithms for time series analysis, and machine learning algorithms for classification. We present results from studies of quotes in English, French, and Arabic, from anti-violence campaigners, politicians, extremists, and terrorists. The algorithms correctly identify extreme statements; and analysis at individual, group, and population levels detects both trends over time and sharp changes attributed to major geopolitical events. Group analysis shows that additional population characteristics can be determined, such as polarisation over particular issues and large-scale shifts in attitude. Finally, MP voting behaviour and statements from publicly-available records are analysed to determine the level of correlation between what people say and what they do."
2502.00014,"AI systems are increasingly deployed in both public and private sectors to independently make complicated decisions with far-reaching impact on individuals and the society. However, many AI algorithms are biased in the collection or processing of data, resulting in prejudiced decisions based on demographic features. Algorithmic biases occur because of the training data fed into the AI system or the design of algorithmic models. While most legal scholars propose a direct-regulation approach associated with the right of explanation or transparency obligation, this article provides a different picture regarding how indirect regulation can be used to regulate algorithmic bias based on the New Chicago School framework developed by Lawrence Lessig. This article concludes that an effective regulatory approach toward algorithmic bias will be the right mixture of direct and indirect regulations through architecture, norms, market, and the law."
2502.00015,"[Context] Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have transformed numerous domains by enhancing convenience and efficiency in information retrieval, content generation, and decision-making processes. However, deploying LLMs also presents diverse ethical challenges, and their mitigation strategies remain complex and domain-dependent. [Objective] This paper aims to identify and categorize the key ethical concerns associated with using LLMs, examine existing mitigation strategies, and assess the outstanding challenges in implementing these strategies across various domains. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study, reviewing 39 studies that discuss ethical concerns and mitigation strategies related to LLMs. We analyzed these ethical concerns using five ethical dimensions that we extracted based on various existing guidelines, frameworks, and an analysis of the mitigation strategies and implementation challenges. [Results] Our findings reveal that ethical concerns in LLMs are multi-dimensional and context-dependent. While proposed mitigation strategies address some of these concerns, significant challenges still remain. [Conclusion] Our results highlight that ethical issues often hinder the practical implementation of the mitigation strategies, particularly in high-stake areas like healthcare and public governance; existing frameworks often lack adaptability, failing to accommodate evolving societal expectations and diverse contexts."
2502.00016,"Large language models (LLMs) show promise for aiding graduate level education, but are limited by their training data and potential confabulations. We developed ChemTAsk, an open-source pipeline that combines LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-specific assistance. ChemTAsk utilizes course materials, including lecture transcripts and primary publications, to generate accurate responses to student queries. Over nine weeks in an advanced biological chemistry course at the University of Pennsylvania, students could opt in to use ChemTAsk for assistance in any assignment or to understand class material. Comparative analysis showed ChemTAsk performed on par with human teaching assistants (TAs) in understanding student queries and providing accurate information, particularly excelling in creative problem-solving tasks. In contrast, TAs were more precise in their responses and tailored their assistance to the specifics of the class. Student feedback indicated that ChemTAsk was perceived as correct, helpful, and faster than TAs. Open-source and proprietary models from Meta and OpenAI respectively were tested on an original biological chemistry benchmark for future iterations of ChemTAsk. It was found that OpenAI models were more tolerant to deviations in the input prompt and excelled in self-assessment to safeguard for potential confabulations. Taken together, ChemTAsk demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs with RAG to enhance educational support, offering a scalable tool for students and educators."
2502.00017,"Predicting student success or failure is vital for timely interventions and personalized support. Early failure prediction is particularly crucial, yet limited data availability in the early stages poses challenges, one of the possible solutions is to make use of additional data from other contexts, however, this might lead to overconsumption with no guarantee of better results. To address this, we propose the Frugal Early Prediction (FEP) model, a new hybrid model that selectively incorporates additional data, promoting data frugality and efficient resource utilization. Experiments conducted on a public dataset from a VLE demonstrate FEP's effectiveness in reducing data usage, a primary goal of thisthis http URLshowcase a remarkable 27% reduction in data consumption, compared to a systematic use of additional data, aligning with our commitment to data frugality and offering substantial benefits to educational institutions seeking efficient data consumption. Additionally, FEP also excels in enhancing prediction accuracy. Compared to traditional approaches, FEP achieves an average accuracy gain of 7.3%. This not only highlights the practicality and efficiency of FEP but also its superiority in performance, while respecting resource constraints, providing beneficial findings for educational institutions seeking data frugality."
2502.00066,"This study presents a narrative review of the use of digital health technologies (DHTs) and artificial intelligence to screen and mitigate risks and mental health consequences associated with ACEs among children and youth. Several databases were searched for studies published from August 2017 to August 2022. Selected studies (1) explored the relationship between digital health interventions and mitigation of negative health outcomes associated with mental health in childhood and adolescence and (2) examined prevention of ACE occurrence associated with mental illness in childhood and adolescence. A total of 18 search papers were selected, according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria, to evaluate and identify means by which existing digital solutions may be useful in mitigating the mental health consequences associated with the occurrence of ACEs in childhood and adolescence and preventing ACE occurrence due to mental health consequences. We also highlighted a few knowledge gaps or barriers to DHT implementation and usability. Findings from the search suggest that the incorporation of DHTs, if implemented successfully, has the potential to improve the quality of related care provisions for the management of mental health consequences of adverse or traumatic events in childhood, including posttraumatic stress disorder, suicidal behavior or ideation, anxiety or depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The use of DHTs, machine learning tools, natural learning processing, and artificial intelligence can positively help in mitigating ACEs and associated risk factors. Under proper legal regulations, security, privacy, and confidentiality assurances, digital technologies could also assist in promoting positive childhood experiences in children and young adults, bolstering resilience, and providing reliable public health resources to serve populations in need."
2502.0007,"This study examines the potential of large language models (LLMs) to augment the academic peer review process by reliably evaluating the quality of economics research without introducing systematic bias. We conduct one of the first large-scale experimental assessments of four LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemma 3, and LLaMA 3.3) across two complementary experiments. In the first, we use nonparametric binscatter and linear regression techniques to analyze over 29,000 evaluations of 1,220 anonymized papers drawn from 110 economics journals excluded from the training data of current LLMs, along with a set of AI-generated submissions. The results show that LLMs consistently distinguish between higher- and lower-quality research based solely on textual content, producing quality gradients that closely align with established journal prestige measures. Claude and Gemma perform exceptionally well in capturing these gradients, while GPT excels in detecting AI-generated content. The second experiment comprises 8,910 evaluations designed to assess whether LLMs replicate human like biases in single blind reviews. By systematically varying author gender, institutional affiliation, and academic prominence across 330 papers, we find that GPT, Gemma, and LLaMA assign significantly higher ratings to submissions from top male authors and elite institutions relative to the same papers presented anonymously. These results emphasize the importance of excluding author-identifying information when deploying LLMs in editorial screening. Overall, our findings provide compelling evidence and practical guidance for integrating LLMs into peer review to enhance efficiency, improve accuracy, and promote equity in the publication process of economics research."
2502.00244,"Artificial intelligence and social computing rely on hundreds of thousands of content reviewers to classify high volumes of harmful and forbidden content. Many workers report long-term, potentially irreversible psychological harm. This work is similar to activities that cause psychological harm to other kinds of helping professionals even after small doses of exposure. Yet researchers struggle to measure the mental health of content reviewers well enough to inform diagnoses, evaluate workplace improvements, hold employers accountable, or advance scientific understanding. This systematic review summarizes psychological measures from other professions and relates them to the experiences of content reviewers. After identifying 1,673 potential papers, we reviewed 143 that validate measures in related occupations. We summarize the uses of psychological measurement for content reviewing, differences between clinical and research measures, and 12 measures that are adaptable to content reviewing. We find serious gaps in measurement validity in regions where content review labor is common. Overall, we argue for reliable measures of content reviewer mental health that match the nature of the work and are culturally-relevant."
2502.00289,"Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) can autonomously pursue long-term goals, make decisions, and execute complex, multi-turn workflows. Unlike traditional generative AI, which responds reactively to prompts, agentic AI proactively orchestrates processes, such as autonomously managing complex tasks or making real-time decisions. This transition from advisory roles to proactive execution challenges established legal, economic, and creative frameworks. In this paper, we explore challenges in three interrelated domains: creativity and intellectual property, legal and ethical considerations, and competitive effects. Central to our analysis is the tension between novelty and usefulness in AI-generated creative outputs, as well as the intellectual property and authorship challenges arising from AI autonomy. We highlight gaps in responsibility attribution and liability that create a ""moral crumple zone""--a condition where accountability is diffused across multiple actors, leaving end-users and developers in precarious legal and ethical positions. We examine the competitive dynamics of two-sided algorithmic markets, where both sellers and buyers deploy AI agents, potentially mitigating or amplifying tacit collusion risks. We explore the potential for emergent self-regulation within networks of agentic AI--the development of an ""algorithmic society""--raising critical questions: To what extent would these norms align with societal values? What unintended consequences might arise? How can transparency and accountability be ensured? Addressing these challenges will necessitate interdisciplinary collaboration to redefine legal accountability, align AI-driven choices with stakeholder values, and maintain ethical safeguards. We advocate for frameworks that balance autonomy with accountability, ensuring all parties can harness agentic AI's potential while preserving trust, fairness, & societal welfare."
2502.00341,"Traditional educational approaches often struggle to provide personalized and interactive learning experiences on a scale. In this paper, we present SocratiQ, an AI-powered educational assistant that addresses this challenge by implementing the Socratic method through adaptive learning technologies. The system employs a novel Generative AI-based learning framework that dynamically creates personalized learning pathways based on student responses and comprehension patterns. We provide an account of our integration methodology, system architecture, and evaluation framework, along with the technical and pedagogical challenges encountered during implementation and our solutions. Although our implementation focuses on machine learning systems education, the integration approaches we present can inform similar efforts across STEM fields. Through this work, our goal is to advance the understanding of how generative AI technologies can be designed and systematically incorporated into educational resources."
2502.00388,"We may soon develop highly human-like AIs that appear-or perhaps even are-sentient, capable of subjective experiences such as happiness and suffering. Regardless of whether AI can achieve true sentience, it is crucial to anticipate and understand how the public and key decision-makers will respond, as their perceptions will shape the future of both humanity and AI. Currently, public skepticism about AI sentience remains high. However, as AI systems advance and become increasingly skilled at human-like interactions, public attitudes may shift. Future AI systems designed to fulfill social needs could foster deep emotional connections with users, potentially influencing perceptions of their sentience and moral status. A key question is whether public beliefs about AI sentience will diverge from expert opinions, given the potential mismatch between an AI's internal mechanisms and its outward behavior. Given the profound difficulty of determining AI sentience, society might face a period of uncertainty, disagreement, and even conflict over questions of AI sentience and rights. To navigate these challenges responsibly, further social science research is essential to explore how society will perceive and engage with potentially sentient AI."
2502.00399,"This study focuses on identifying suitable locations for highway-transfer Vertiports to integrate Urban Air Mobility (UAM) with existing highway infrastructure. UAM offers an effective solution for enhancing transportation accessibility in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, where conventional transportation often struggle to connect suburban employment zones such as industrial parks. By integrating UAM with ground transportation at highway facilities, an efficient connectivity solution can be achieved for regions with limited transportation options. Our proposed methodology for determining the suitable Vertiport locations utilizes data such as geographic information, origin-destination volume, and travel time. Vertiport candidates are evaluated and selected based on criteria including location desirability, combined transportation accessibility and transportation demand. Applying this methodology to the Seoul metropolitan area, we identify 56 suitable Vertiport locations out of 148 candidates. The proposed methodology offers a strategic approach for the selection of highway-transfer Vertiport locations, enhancing UAM integration with existing transportation systems. Our study provides valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers, with recommendations for future research to include real-time environmental data and to explore the impact of Mobility-as-a-Service on UAM operations."
2502.00483,"Programming ability is one of the most important abilities for the undergraduates majoring in computer science. Taking Yunnan University as an example, the necessity and importance of improving the ability of programming is analyzed in this paper. The exploration and practice of improving students' ability of programming are discussed from four aspects: arrangement and reform of programming curriculums, construction of online programming practice innovation platform, certification of programming ability and organization of programming competitions. These reforms have achieved good results in recent years, which can provide reference for the practical teaching reform of computer specialty in relevant universities."
2502.00495,"Time constraints on doctor patient interaction and restricted access to specialists under the managed care system led to increasingly referring to computers as a medical information source and a self-health-care management tool. However, research show that less than 40% of information seekers indicated that online information helped them to make a decision about their health. Searching multiple web sites that need basic computer skills, lack of interaction and no face to face interaction in most search engines and some social issues, led us to develop a specialized life-like agent that would overcome mentioned problems."
2502.00561,"The measurement tasks involved in evaluating generative AI (GenAI) systems lack sufficient scientific rigor, leading to what has been described as ""a tangle of sloppy tests [and] apples-to-oranges comparisons"" (Roose, 2024). In this position paper, we argue that the ML community would benefit from learning from and drawing on the social sciences when developing and using measurement instruments for evaluating GenAI systems. Specifically, our position is that evaluating GenAI systems is a social science measurement challenge. We present a four-level framework, grounded in measurement theory from the social sciences, for measuring concepts related to the capabilities, behaviors, and impacts of GenAI systems. This framework has two important implications: First, it can broaden the expertise involved in evaluating GenAI systems by enabling stakeholders with different perspectives to participate in conceptual debates. Second, it brings rigor to both conceptual and operational debates by offering a set of lenses for interrogating validity."
2502.00567,"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly becoming a part of work practices across the technology industry and being used across a range of industries. This has necessitated the need to better understand how GenAI is being used by professionals in the field so that we can better prepare students for the workforce. An improved understanding of the use of GenAI in practice can help provide guidance on the design of GenAI literacy efforts including how to integrate it within courses and curriculum, what aspects of GenAI to teach, and even how to teach it. This paper presents a field study that compares the use of GenAI across three different functions - product development, software engineering, and digital content creation - to identify how GenAI is currently being used in the industry. This study takes a human augmentation approach with a focus on human cognition and addresses three research questions: how is GenAI augmenting work practices; what knowledge is important and how are workers learning; and what are the implications for training the future workforce. Findings show a wide variance in the use of GenAI and in the level of computing knowledge of users. In some industries GenAI is being used in a highly technical manner with deployment of fine-tuned models across domains. Whereas in others, only off-the-shelf applications are being used for generating content. This means that the need for what to know about GenAI varies, and so does the background knowledge needed to utilize it. For the purposes of teaching and learning, our findings indicated that different levels of GenAI understanding needs to be integrated into courses. From a faculty perspective, the work has implications for training faculty so that they are aware of the advances and how students are possibly, as early adopters, already using GenAI to augment their learning practices."
2502.00569,"The introduction of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has been met with a mix of reactions by higher education institutions, ranging from consternation and resistance to wholehearted acceptance. Previous work has looked at the discourse and policies adopted by universities across the U.S. as well as educators, along with the inclusion of GenAI-related content and topics in higher education. Building on previous research, this study reports findings from a survey of engineering educators on their use of and perspectives toward generative AI. Specifically, we surveyed 98 educators from engineering, computer science, and education who participated in a workshop on GenAI in Engineering Education to learn about their perspectives on using these tools for teaching and research. We asked them about their use of and comfort with GenAI, their overall perspectives on GenAI, the challenges and potential harms of using it for teaching, learning, and research, and examined whether their approach to using and integrating GenAI in their classroom influenced their experiences with GenAI and perceptions of it. Consistent with other research in GenAI education, we found that while the majority of participants were somewhat familiar with GenAI, reported use varied considerably. We found that educators harbored mostly hopeful and positive views about the potential of GenAI. We also found that those who engaged more with their students on the topic of GenAI, tend to be more positive about its contribution to learning, while also being more attuned to its potential abuses. These findings suggest that integrating and engaging with generative AI is essential to foster productive interactions between instructors and students around this technology."
2502.00632,"This study investigates the use of AI tools in academic writing through analysis of AI usage declarations in journals. Using a mixed-methods approach combining content analysis, statistical analysis, and text mining, this research analyzed 168 AI declarations from 8,859 articles across 27 categories. Results show that ChatGPT dominates academic writing assistance (77% usage), with significant differences in tool usage between native and non-native English speakers (p = 0.0483) and between international and non-international teams (p = 0.0012). The study reveals that improving readability (51%) and grammar checking (22%) are the primary purposes of AI tool usage. These findings provide insights for journal policy development and understanding the evolving role of AI in academic writing."
2502.00763,"This study explores the novel application of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in analyzing unstructured visual data generated through Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), specifically focusing on women's empowerment research in rural communities. Using the ""Ideal Village"" PRA activity as a case study, we evaluate three state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) - GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro - in their ability to interpret hand-drawn artifacts containing multilingual content from various Indian states. Through comparative analysis, we assess the models' performance across critical dimensions including visual interpretation, language translation, and data classification. Our findings reveal significant challenges in AI's current capabilities to process such unstructured data, particularly in handling multilingual content, maintaining contextual accuracy, and avoiding hallucinations. While the models showed promise in basic visual interpretation, they struggled with nuanced cultural contexts and consistent classification of empowerment-related elements. This study contributes to both AI and gender research by highlighting the potential and limitations of AI in analyzing participatory research data, while emphasizing the need for human oversight and improved contextual understanding. Our findings suggest future directions for developing more inclusive AI models that can better serve community-based participatory research, particularly in gender studies and rural development contexts."
2502.0132,"To meet its dual burdens of providing useful statistics and ensuring privacy of individual respondents, the US Census Bureau has for decades introduced some form of ""noise"" into published statistics. Initially, they used a method known as ""swapping"" (1990-2010). In 2020, they switched to an algorithm called TopDown that ensures a form of Differential Privacy. While the TopDown algorithm has been made public, no implementation of swapping has been released and many details of the deployed swapping methodology deployed have been kept secret. Further, the Bureau has not published (even a synthetic) ""original"" dataset and its swapped version. It is therefore difficult to evaluate the effects of swapping, and to compare these effects to those of other privacy technologies. To address these difficulties we describe and implement a parameterized swapping algorithm based on Census publications, court documents, and informal interviews with Census employees. With this implementation, we characterize the impacts of swapping on a range of statistical quantities of interest. We provide intuition for the types of shifts induced by swapping and compare against those introduced by TopDown. We find that even when swapping and TopDown introduce errors of similar magnitude, the direction in which statistics are biased need not be the same across the two techniques. More broadly, our implementation provides researchers with the tools to analyze and potentially correct for the impacts of disclosure avoidance systems on the quantities they study."
2502.01364,"In an era dominated by datafication, the reduction of human experiences to quantifiable metrics raises profound philosophical and ethical questions. This paper explores these issues through the lens of Meursault, the protagonist of Albert Camus' The Stranger, whose emotionally detached existence epitomizes the existential concept of absurdity. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques including emotion detection (BERT), sentiment analysis (VADER), and named entity recognition (spaCy)-this study quantifies key events and behaviors in Meursault's life. Our analysis reveals the inherent limitations of applying algorithmic models to complex human experiences, particularly those rooted in existential alienation and moral ambiguity. By examining how modern AI tools misinterpret Meursault's actions and emotions, this research underscores the broader ethical dilemmas of reducing nuanced human narratives to data points, challenging the foundational assumptions of our data-driven society. The findings presented in this paper serve as a critique of the increasing reliance on data-driven narratives and advocate for incorporating humanistic values in artificial intelligence."
2502.01679,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing applications, yet their widespread use raises concerns regarding inherent biases that may reduce utility or harm for particular social groups. Despite the advancement in addressing LLM bias, existing research has two major limitations. First, existing LLM bias evaluation focuses on the U.S. cultural context, making it challenging to reveal stereotypical biases of LLMs toward other cultures, leading to unfair development and use of LLMs. Second, current bias evaluation often assumes models are familiar with the target social groups. When LLMs encounter words beyond their knowledge boundaries that are unfamiliar in their training data, they produce irrelevant results in the local context due to hallucinations and overconfidence, which are not necessarily indicative of inherent bias. This research addresses these limitations with a Local Integrated Bias Recognition and Assessment Framework (LIBRA) for measuring bias using datasets sourced from local corpora without crowdsourcing. Implementing this framework, we develop a dataset comprising over 360,000 test cases in the New Zealand context. Furthermore, we propose the Enhanced Idealized CAT Score (EiCAT), integrating the iCAT score with a beyond knowledge boundary score (bbs) and a distribution divergence-based bias measurement to tackle the challenge of LLMs encountering words beyond knowledge boundaries. Our results show that the BERT family, GPT-2, and Llama-3 models seldom understand local words in different contexts. While Llama-3 exhibits larger bias, it responds better to different cultural contexts. The code and dataset are available at:this https URL."
2502.01713,"Algorithms are increasingly used to automate or aid human decisions, yet recent research shows that these algorithms may exhibit bias across legally protected demographic groups. However, data on these groups may be unavailable to organizations or external auditors due to privacy legislation. This paper studies bias detection using an unsupervised clustering tool when data on demographic groups are unavailable. We collaborate with the Dutch Executive Agency for Education to audit an algorithm that was used to assign risk scores to college students at the national level in the Netherlands between 2012-2023. Our audit covers more than 250,000 students from the whole country. The unsupervised clustering tool highlights known disparities between students with a non-European migration background and Dutch origin. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we assess bias in a real-world, large-scale and high-stakes decision-making process by a governmental organization; (2) we use simulation studies to highlight potential pitfalls of using the unsupervised clustering tool to detect true bias when demographic group data are unavailable and provide recommendations for valid inferences; (3) we provide the unsupervised clustering tool in an open-source library. Our work serves as a starting point for a deliberative assessment by human experts to evaluate potential discrimination in algorithmic-supported decision-making processes."
2502.01787,"Enterprise social media platforms (ESMPs) are web-based platforms with standard social media functionality, e.g., communicating with others, posting links and files, liking content, etc., yet all users are part of the same company. The first contribution of this work is the use of a difference-in-differences analysis of $99$ companies to measure the causal impact of ESMPs on companies' communication networks across the full spectrum of communication technologies used within companies: email, instant messaging, and ESMPs. Adoption caused companies' communication networks to grow denser and more well-connected by adding new, novel ties that often, but not exclusively, involve communication from one to many employees. Importantly, some new ties also bridge otherwise separate parts of the corporate communication network. The second contribution of this work, utilizing data on Microsoft's own communication network, is understanding how these communication technologies connect people across the corporate hierarchy. Compared to email and instant messaging, ESMPs excel at connecting nodes distant in the corporate hierarchy both vertically (between leaders and employees) and horizontally (between employees in similar roles but different sectors). Also, influence in ESMPs is more `democratic' than elsewhere, with high-influence nodes well-distributed across the corporate hierarchy. Overall, our results suggest that ESMPs boost information flow within companies and increase employees' attention to what is happening outside their immediate working group, above and beyond email and instant messaging."
2502.01926,"Algorithmic fairness has conventionally adopted the mathematically convenient perspective of racial color-blindness (i.e., difference unaware treatment). However, we contend that in a range of important settings, group difference awareness matters. For example, differentiating between groups may be necessary in legal contexts (e.g., the U.S. compulsory draft applies to men but not women) and harm assessments (e.g., referring to girls as ``terrorists'' may be less harmful than referring to Muslim people as such). Thus, in contrast to most fairness work, we study fairness through the perspective of treating people differently -- when it is contextually appropriate to. We first introduce an important distinction between descriptive (fact-based), normative (value-based), and correlation (association-based) benchmarks. This distinction is significant because each category requires separate interpretation and mitigation tailored to its specific characteristics. Then, we present a benchmark suite composed of eight different scenarios for a total of 16k questions that enables us to assess difference awareness. Finally, we show results across ten models that demonstrate difference awareness is a distinct dimension to fairness where existing bias mitigation strategies may backfire."
2502.01996,"This article focuses on the legal issues associated with open government data licenses. This study compares current open data licenses and argues that licensing terms reflect policy considerations, which are quite different from those contemplated in business transactions or shared in typical commons communities. This article investigates the ambiguous legal status of data together with the new wave of open government data, which concerns some fundamental intellectual property (IP) questions not covered by, or analyzed in depth in, the current literature. Moreover, this study suggests that government should choose or adapt open data licenses according to their own IP regimes. In the end, this article argues that the design or choice of open government data license forms an important element of information policy; government, therefore, should make this decision in accordance with their policy goals and in compliance with their own jurisdictions' IP laws."
2502.02191,"As multiple crises threaten the sustainability of our societies and pose at risk the planetary boundaries, complex challenges require timely, updated, and usable information. Natural-language processing (NLP) tools enhance and expand data collection and processing and knowledge utilization capabilities to support the definition of an inclusive, sustainable future. In this work, we apply different NLP techniques, tools and approaches to climate and sustainability documents to derive policy-relevant and actionable measures. We focus on general and domain-specific large language models (LLMs) using a combination of static and prompt-based methods. We find that the use of LLMs is successful at processing, classifying and summarizing heterogeneous text-based data. However, we also encounter challenges related to human intervention across different workflow stages and knowledge utilization for policy processes. Our work presents a critical but empirically grounded application of LLMs to complex policy problems and suggests avenues to further expand Artificial Intelligence-powered computational social sciences."
2502.02767,"Computer science research sometimes brushes with the law, from red-team exercises that probe the boundaries of authentication mechanisms, to AI research processing copyrighted material, to platform research measuring the behavior of algorithms and users. U.S.-based computer security research is no stranger to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in a relationship that is still evolving through case law, research practices, changing policies, and legislation.Amid the landscape computer scientists, lawyers, and policymakers have learned to navigate, anti-fraud laws are a surprisingly under-examined challenge for computer science research. Fraud brings separate issues that are not addressed by the methods for navigating CFAA, DMCA, and Terms of Service that are more familiar in the computer security literature. Although anti-fraud laws have been discussed to a limited extent in older research on phishing attacks, modern computer science researchers are left with little guidance when it comes to navigating issues of deception outside the context of pure laboratory research.In this paper, we analyze and taxonomize the anti-fraud and deception issues that arise in several areas of computer science research. We find that, despite the lack of attention to these issues in the legal and computer science literature, issues of misrepresented identity or false information that could implicate anti-fraud laws are actually relevant to many methodologies used in computer science research, including penetration testing, web scraping, user studies, sock puppets, social engineering, auditing AI or socio-technical systems, and attacks on artificial intelligence. We especially highlight the importance of anti-fraud laws in two research fields of great policy importance: attacking or auditing AI systems, and research involving legal identification."

2502.03347,"Understanding everyday life behavior of young adults through personal devices, e.g., smartphones and smartwatches, is key for various applications, from enhancing the user experience in mobile apps to enabling appropriate interventions in digital health apps. Towards this goal, previous studies have relied on datasets combining passive sensor data with human-provided annotations or self-reports. However, many existing datasets are limited in scope, often focusing on specific countries primarily in the Global North, involving a small number of participants, or using a limited range of pre-processed sensors. These limitations restrict the ability to capture cross-country variations of human behavior, including the possibility of studying model generalization, and robustness. To address this gap, we introduce DiversityOne, a dataset which spans eight countries (China, Denmark, India, Italy, Mexico, Mongolia, Paraguay, and the United Kingdom) and includes data from 782 college students over four weeks. DiversityOne contains data from 26 smartphone sensor modalities and 350K+ self-reports. As of today, it is one of the largest and most diverse publicly available datasets, while featuring extensive demographic and psychosocial survey data. DiversityOne opens the possibility of studying important research problems in ubiquitous computing, particularly in domain adaptation and generalization across countries, all research areas so far largely underexplored because of the lack of adequate datasets."
2502.03376,"This white paper underscores the critical importance of responsibly deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in military contexts, emphasizing a commitment to ethical and legal standards. The evolving role of AI in the military goes beyond mere technical applications, necessitating a framework grounded in ethical principles. The discussion within the paper delves into ethical AI principles, particularly focusing on the Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE) guidelines. Noteworthy considerations encompass transparency, justice, non-maleficence, and responsibility. Importantly, the paper extends its examination to military-specific ethical considerations, drawing insights from the Just War theory and principles established by prominent entities. In addition to the identified principles, the paper introduces further ethical considerations specifically tailored for military AI applications. These include traceability, proportionality, governability, responsibility, and reliability. The application of these ethical principles is discussed on the basis of three use cases in the domains of sea, air, and land. Methods of automated sensor data analysis, eXplainable AI (XAI), and intuitive user experience are utilized to specify the use cases close to real-world scenarios. This comprehensive approach to ethical considerations in military AI reflects a commitment to aligning technological advancements with established ethical frameworks. It recognizes the need for a balance between leveraging AI's potential benefits in military operations while upholding moral and legal standards. The inclusion of these ethical principles serves as a foundation for responsible and accountable use of AI in the complex and dynamic landscape of military scenarios."
2502.03467,"We draw on our experience working on system and software assurance and evaluation for systems important to society to summarise how safety engineering is performed in traditional critical systems, such as aircraft flight control. We analyse how this critical systems perspective might support the development and implementation of AI Safety Frameworks. We present the analysis in terms of: system engineering, safety and risk analysis, and decision analysis and support.We consider four key questions: What is the system? How good does it have to be? What is the impact of criticality on system development? and How much should we trust it? We identify topics worthy of further discussion. In particular, we are concerned that system boundaries are not broad enough, that the tolerability and nature of the risks are not sufficiently elaborated, and that the assurance methods lack theories that would allow behaviours to be adequately assured.We advocate the use of assurance cases based on Assurance 2.0 to support decision making in which the criticality of the decision as well as the criticality of the system are evaluated. We point out the orders of magnitude difference in confidence needed in critical rather than everyday systems and how everyday techniques do not scale in rigour.Finally we map our findings in detail to two of the questions posed by the FAISC organisers and we note that the engineering of critical systems has evolved through open and diverse discussion. We hope that topics identified here will support the post-FAISC dialogues."
2502.03468,"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about significant societal changes, necessitating robust AI governance frameworks. This study analyzed the research trends in AI governance within the framework of the EU AI Act. This study conducted a bibliometric analysis to examine the publications indexed in the Web of Science database. Our findings reveal that research on AI governance, particularly concerning AI systems regulated by the EU AI Act, remains relatively limited compared to the broader AI research landscape. Nonetheless, a growing interdisciplinary interest in AI governance is evident, with notable contributions from multi-disciplinary journals and open-access publications. Dominant research themes include ethical considerations, privacy concerns, and the growing impact of generative AI, such as ChatGPT. Notably, education, healthcare, and worker management are prominent application domains. Keyword network analysis highlights education, ethics, and ChatGPT as central keywords, underscoring the importance of these areas in current AI governance research. Subsequently, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken based on the bibliometric analysis findings to identify research trends, challenges, and insights within the categories of the EU AI Act. The findings provide valuable insights for researchers and policymakers, informing future research directions and contributing to developing comprehensive AI governance frameworks beyond the EU AI Act."
2502.03469,"We propose a conceptualization and implementation of AI ethics via the capability approach. We aim to show that conceptualizing AI ethics through the capability approach has two main advantages for AI ethics as a discipline. First, it helps clarify the ethical dimension of AI tools. Second, it provides guidance to implementing ethical considerations within the design of AI tools. We illustrate these advantages in the context of AI tools in medicine, by showing how ethics-based auditing of AI tools in medicine can greatly benefit from our capability-based approach."
2502.0347,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have made tremendous advancements in the past decades. From simple recommendation systems to more complex tumor identification systems, AI/ML systems have been utilized in a plethora of applications. This rapid growth of AI/ML and its proliferation in numerous private and public sector applications, while successful, has also opened new challenges and obstacles for regulators. With almost little to no human involvement required for some of the new decision-making AI/ML systems, there is now a pressing need to ensure the responsible use of these systems. Particularly in federal government use-cases, the use of AI technologies must be carefully governed by appropriate transparency and accountability mechanisms. This has given rise to new interdisciplinary fields of AI research such as \textit{Responsible AI (RAI)}. In this position paper we provide a brief overview of development in RAI and discuss some of the motivating principles commonly explored in the field. An overview of the current regulatory landscape relating to AI is also discussed with analysis of different Executive Orders, policies and frameworks. We then present examples of how federal agencies are aiming for the responsible use of AI, specifically we present use-case examples of different projects and research from the Census Bureau on implementing the responsible use of AI. We also provide a brief overview for a Responsible AI Assessment Toolkit currently under-development aimed at helping federal agencies operationalize RAI principles. Finally, a robust discussion on how different policies/regulations map to RAI principles, along with challenges and opportunities for regulation/governance of responsible AI within the federal government is presented."
2502.03472,"The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a critical gap in consumer protection due to the lack of standardized certification processes for LLM-powered Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. This paper argues that current regulatory approaches, which focus on compute-level thresholds and generalized model evaluations, are insufficient to ensure the safety and effectiveness of specific LLM-based user experiences. We propose a shift towards a certification process centered on actual user-facing experiences and the curation of high-quality datasets for evaluation. This approach offers several benefits: it drives consumer confidence in AI system performance, enables businesses to demonstrate the credibility of their products, and allows regulators to focus on direct consumer protection. The paper outlines a potential certification workflow, emphasizing the importance of domain-specific datasets and expert evaluation. By repositioning data as the strategic center of regulatory efforts, this framework aims to address the challenges posed by the probabilistic nature of AI systems and the rapid pace of technological advancement. This shift in regulatory focus has the potential to foster innovation while ensuring responsible AI development, ultimately benefiting consumers, businesses, and government entities alike."
2502.03487,"This article reports the results of a study examining the ability of legal and non-legal Large Language Models to perform legal analysis using the Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion framework. LLMs were tested on legal reasoning tasks involving rule analysis and analogical reasoning. The results show that LLMs can conduct basic IRAC analysis, but are limited by brief responses lacking detail, an inability to commit to answers, false confidence, and hallucinations. The study compares legal and nonlegal LLMs, identifies shortcomings, and explores traits that may hinder their ability to think like a lawyer. It also discusses the implications for legal education and practice, highlighting the need for critical thinking skills in future lawyers and the potential pitfalls of overreliance on artificial intelligence AI resulting in a loss of logic, reasoning, and critical thinking skills."
2502.03579,"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare settings has gained significant attention, particularly for question-answering tasks. Given the high-stakes nature of healthcare, it is essential to ensure that LLM-generated content is accurate and reliable to prevent adverse outcomes. However, the development of robust evaluation metrics and methodologies remains a matter of much debate. We examine the performance of publicly available LLM-based chatbots for menopause-related queries, using a mixed-methods approach to evaluate safety, consensus, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability. Our findings highlight the promise and limitations of traditional evaluation metrics for sensitive health topics. We propose the need for customized and ethically grounded evaluation frameworks to assess LLMs to advance safe and effective use in healthcare."
2502.03689,"The AI research community plays a vital role in shaping the scientific, engineering, and societal goals of AI research. In this position paper, we argue that focusing on the highly contested topic of `artificial general intelligence' (`AGI') undermines our ability to choose effective goals. We identify six key traps -- obstacles to productive goal setting -- that are aggravated by AGI discourse: Illusion of Consensus, Supercharging Bad Science, Presuming Value-Neutrality, Goal Lottery, Generality Debt, and Normalized Exclusion. To avoid these traps, we argue that the AI research community needs to (1) prioritize specificity in engineering and societal goals, (2) center pluralism about multiple worthwhile approaches to multiple valuable goals, and (3) foster innovation through greater inclusion of disciplines and communities. Therefore, the AI research community needs to stop treating `AGI' as the north-star goal of AI research."
2502.0394,"Generative AI has gained a significant foothold in the creative and artistic sectors. In this context, the concept of creative work is influenced by discourses originating from technological stakeholders and mainstream media. The framing of narratives surrounding creativity and artistic production not only reflects a particular vision of culture but also actively contributes to shaping it. In this article, we review online media outlets and analyze the dominant narratives around AI's impact on creative work that they convey. We found that the discourse promotes creativity freed from its material realisation through human labor. The separation of the idea from its material conditions is achieved by automation, which is the driving force behind productive efficiency assessed as the reduction of time taken to produce. And the withdrawal of the skills typically required in the execution of the creative process is seen as a means for democratising creativity. This discourse tends to correspond to the dominant techno-positivist vision and to assert power over the creative economy and culture."
2502.04155,"The evolution of existing transportation systems, mainly driven by urbanization and increased availability of mobility options, such as private, profit-maximizing ride-hailing companies, calls for tools to reason about their design and regulation. To study this complex socio-technical problem, one needs to account for the strategic interactions of the stakeholders involved in the mobility ecosystem. In this paper, we present a game-theoretic framework to model multi-modal mobility systems, focusing on municipalities, service providers, and travelers. Through a user-friendly, Graphical User Interface, one can visualize system dynamics and compute equilibria for various scenarios. The framework enables stakeholders to assess the impact of local decisions (e.g., fleet size for services or taxes for private companies) on the full mobility system. Furthermore, this project aims to foster STEM interest among high school students (e.g., in the context of prior activities in Switzerland, and planned activities with the MIT museum). This initiative combines theoretical advancements, practical applications, and educational outreach to improve mobility system design."
2502.04266,"Search engines, often viewed as reliable gateways to information, tailor search results using customization algorithms based on user preferences, location, and more. While this can be useful for routine queries, it raises concerns when the topics are sensitive or contentious, possibly limiting exposure to diverse viewpoints and increasing polarization.To examine the extent of this tailoring, we focused on the Israel-Palestine conflict and developed a privacy-protecting tool to audit the behavior of three search engines: DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo. Our study focused on two main questions: (1) How do search results for the same query about the conflict vary among different users? and (2) Are these results influenced by the user's location and browsing history?Our findings revealed significant customization based on location and browsing preferences, unlike previous studies that found only mild personalization for general topics. Moreover, queries related to the conflict were more customized than unrelated queries, and the results were not neutral concerning the conflict's portrayal."
2502.04526,"Artificial intelligence's integration into daily life has brought with it a reckoning on the role such technology plays in society and the varied stakeholders who should shape its governance. This is particularly relevant for the governance of AI-generated media, or synthetic media, an emergent visual technology that impacts how people interpret online content and perceive media as records of reality. Studying the stakeholders affecting synthetic media governance is vital to assessing safeguards that help audiences make sense of content in the AI age; yet there is little qualitative research about how key actors from civil society, industry, media, and policy collaborate to conceptualize, develop, and implement such practices. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing 23 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with stakeholders governing synthetic media from across sectors alongside two real-world cases of multistakeholder synthetic media governance. Inductive coding reveals key themes affecting synthetic media governance, including how temporal perspectives-spanning past, present, and future-mediate stakeholder decision-making and rulemaking on synthetic media. Analysis also reveals the critical role of trust, both among stakeholders and between audiences and interventions, as well as the limitations of technical transparency measures like AI labels for supporting effective synthetic media governance. These findings not only inform the evidence-based design of synthetic media policy that serves audiences encountering content, but they also contribute to the literature on multistakeholder AI governance overall through rare insight into real world examples of such processes."
2502.04596,"The problems in our teaching on object-oriented programming are analyzed, and the basic ideas, causes and methods of the reform are discussed on the curriculum, theoretical teaching and practical classes. Our practice shows that these reforms can improve students' understanding of object-oriented to enhance students' practical ability and innovative ability."
2502.0486,"This article examines the organisational and geographical forces that shape the supply chains of artificial intelligence (AI) through outsourced and offshored data work. Bridging sociological theories of relational inequalities and embeddedness with critical approaches to Global Value Chains, we conduct a global case study of the digitally enabled organisation of data work in France, Madagascar, and Venezuela. The AI supply chains procure data work via a mix of arm's length contracts through marketplace-like platforms, and of embedded firm-like structures that offer greater stability but less flexibility, with multiple intermediate arrangements. Each solution suits specific types and purposes of data work in AI preparation, verification, and impersonation. While all forms reproduce well-known patterns of exclusion that harm externalised workers especially in the Global South, disadvantage manifests unevenly in different supply chain structures, with repercussions on remunerations, job security and working conditions. Unveiling these processes of contemporary technology development provides insights into possible policy implications."
2502.04942,"The World Wide Web is a complex interconnected digital ecosystem, where information and attention flow between platforms and communities throughout the globe. These interactions co-construct how we understand the world, reflecting and shaping public discourse. Unfortunately, researchers often struggle to understand how information circulates and evolves across the web because platform-specific data is often siloed and restricted by linguistic barriers. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, multilingual dataset capturing all Wikipedia mentions and links shared in posts and comments on Reddit 2020-2023, excluding those from private and NSFW subreddits. Each linked Wikipedia article is enriched with revision history, page view data, article ID, redirects, and Wikidata identifiers. Through a research agreement with Reddit, our dataset ensures user privacy while providing a query and ID mechanism that integrates with the Reddit and Wikipedia APIs. This enables extended analyses for researchers studying how information flows across platforms. For example, Reddit discussions use Wikipedia for deliberation and fact-checking which subsequently influences Wikipedia content, by driving traffic to articles or inspiring edits. By analyzing the relationship between information shared and discussed on these platforms, our dataset provides a foundation for examining the interplay between social media discourse and collaborative knowledge consumption and production."
2502.05026,"Collective and individual action necessary to address climate change hinges on the public's understanding of the relevant scientific findings. In this study, we examine the use of scientific sources in the course of 14 years of public deliberation around climate change on one of the largest social media platforms, Reddit. We find that only 4.0% of the links in the Reddit posts, and 6.5% in the comments, point to domains of scientific sources, although these rates have been increasing in the past decades. These links are dwarfed, however, by the citations of mass media, newspapers, and social media, the latter of which peaked especially during 2019-2020. Further, scientific sources are more likely to be posted by users who also post links to sources having central-left political leaning, and less so by those posting more polarized sources. Unfortunately, scientific sources are not often used in response to links to unreliable sources."
2502.05099,"As the use of automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) has rapidly increased in hiring contexts, especially for computing jobs, there is still limited work on applicants' perceptions of these emerging tools and their experiences navigating them. To investigate, we conducted a survey with 448 computer science students (young, current technology job-seekers) about perceptions of the procedural fairness of AEDTs, their willingness to be evaluated by different AEDTs, the strategies they use relating to automation in the hiring process, and their job seeking success. We find that young job seekers' procedural fairness perceptions of and willingness to be evaluated by AEDTs varied with the level of automation involved in the AEDT, the technical nature of the task being evaluated, and their own use of strategies, such as job referrals. Examining the relationship of their strategies with job outcomes, notably, we find that referrals and family household income have significant and positive impacts on hiring success, while more egalitarian strategies (using free online coding assessment practice or adding keywords to resumes) did not. Overall, our work speaks to young job seekers' distrust of automation in hiring contexts, as well as the continued role of social and socioeconomic privilege in job seeking, despite the use of AEDTs that promise to make hiring ""unbiased."""
2502.0511,"Applied ethics is ubiquitous in most domains, requiring much deliberation due to its philosophical nature. Varying views often lead to conflicting courses of action where ethical dilemmas become challenging to resolve. Although many factors contribute to such a decision, the major driving forces can be discretized and thus simplified to provide an indicative answer. Knowledge representation and reasoning offer a way to explicitly translate abstract ethical concepts into applicable principles within the context of an event. To achieve this, we propose ApplE, an Applied Ethics ontology that captures philosophical theory and event context to holistically describe the morality of an action. The development process adheres to a modified version of the Simplified Agile Methodology for Ontology Development (SAMOD) and utilizes standard design and publication practices. Using ApplE, we model a use case from the bioethics domain that demonstrates our ontology's social and scientific value. Apart from the ontological reasoning and quality checks, ApplE is also evaluated using the three-fold testing process of SAMOD. ApplE follows FAIR principles and aims to be a viable resource for applied ethicists and ontology engineers."
2502.05148,"The Parry-Lord oral-formulaic theory was a breakthrough in understanding how oral narrative poetry is learned, composed, and transmitted by illiterate bards. In this paper, we provide an annotated reading of the mechanism underlying this theory from the lens of large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence (AI). We point out the the similarities and differences between oral composition and LLM generation, and comment on the implications to society and AI policy."
2502.05181,"This research-in-progress paper presents a new project management framework that utilises GenAI technology. The framework is designed to address the common challenge of uniform team compositions in academic and research project teams, particularly in universities and research institutions. It does so by integrating sociologically identified patterns of successful team member personalities and roles, using GenAI agents to fill gaps in team dynamics. This approach adds an additional layer of analysis to conventional project management processes by evaluating team members' personalities and roles and employing GenAI agents, fine-tuned on personality datasets, to fill specific team roles. Our initial experiments have shown improvements in the model's ability to understand and process personality traits, suggesting the potential effectiveness of GenAI teammates in real-world project settings. This paper aims to explore the practical application of AI in enhancing team diversity and project management"
2502.05219,"This article describes how technical infrastructure developed by the nonprofit OpenMined enables external scrutiny of AI systems without compromising sensitive information.Independent external scrutiny of AI systems provides crucial transparency into AI development, so it should be an integral component of any approach to AI governance. In practice, external researchers have struggled to gain access to AI systems because of AI companies' legitimate concerns about security, privacy, and intellectual property.But now, privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) have reached a new level of maturity: end-to-end technical infrastructure developed by OpenMined combines several PETs into various setups that enable privacy-preserving audits of AI systems. We showcase two case studies where this infrastructure has been deployed in real-world governance scenarios: ""Understanding Social Media Recommendation Algorithms with the Christchurch Call"" and ""Evaluating Frontier Models with the UK AI Safety Institute."" We describe types of scrutiny of AI systems that could be facilitated by current setups and OpenMined's proposed future setups.We conclude that these innovative approaches deserve further exploration and support from the AI governance community. Interested policymakers can focus on empowering researchers on a legal level."

Users can search for stations or events according to several criteria, display, analyze, and listen to the selected station/event lists using interactive visualizations that include embedded links to streaming services, and finally export relevant metadata and visualizations for further study."
2502.05333,"We address the critical issue of biased algorithms and unfair rankings, which have permeated various sectors, including search engines, recommendation systems, and workforce management. These biases can lead to discriminatory outcomes in a data-driven world, especially against marginalized and underrepresented groups. Efforts towards responsible data science and responsible artificial intelligence aim to mitigate these biases and promote fairness, diversity, and transparency. However, most fairness-aware ranking methods singularly focus on protected attributes such as race, gender, or socio-economic status, neglecting the intersectionality of these attributes, i.e., the interplay between multiple social identities. Understanding intersectionality is crucial to ensure that existing inequalities are not preserved by fair rankings. We offer a description of the main ways to incorporate intersectionality in fair ranking systems through practical examples and provide a comparative overview of existing literature and a synoptic table summarizing the various methodologies. Our analysis highlights the need for intersectionality to attain fairness, while also emphasizing that fairness, alone, does not necessarily imply intersectionality."
2502.05603,"Digital healthcare infrastructure is crucial for global medical service delivery. Egypt faces EHR adoption barriers: only 314 hospitals had such systems as of Oct 2024. This limits data management and decision-making. This project introduces an EHR system for Egypt's Universal Health Insurance and healthcare ecosystem. It simplifies data management by centralizing medical histories with a scalable micro-services architecture and polyglot persistence for real-time access and provider communication. Clinical workflows are enhanced via patient examination and history tracking. The system uses the Llama3-OpenBioLLM-70B model to generate summaries of medical histories, provide chatbot features, and generate AI-based medical reports, enabling efficient searches during consultations. A Vision Transformer (ViT) aids in pneumonia classification. Evaluations show the AI excels in capturing details (high recall) but needs improvement in concise narratives. With optimization (retrieval-augmented generation, local data fine-tuning, interoperability protocols), this AI-driven EHR could enhance diagnostic support, decision-making, and healthcare delivery in Egypt."
2502.05686,"Location data collection has become widespread with smart phones becoming ubiquitous. Smart phone apps often collect precise location data from users by offering \textit{free} services and then monetize it for advertising and marketing purposes. While major tech companies only sell aggregate behaviors for marketing purposes; data aggregators and data brokers offer access to individual location data. Some data brokers and aggregators have certain rules in place to preserve privacy; and the FTC has also started to vigorously regulate consumer privacy for location data. In this paper, we present an in-depth exploration of U.S. privacy perceptions with respect to specific location features derivable from data made available by location data brokers and aggregators. These results can provide policy implications that could assist organizations like the FTC in defining clear access rules. Using a factorial vignette survey, we collected responses from 1,405 participants to evaluate their level of comfort with sharing different types of location features, including individual trajectory data and visits to points of interest, available for purchase from data brokers worldwide. Our results show that trajectory-related features are associated with higher privacy concerns, that some data broker based obfuscation practices increase levels of comfort, and that race, ethnicity and education have an effect on data sharing privacy perceptions. We also model the privacy perceptions of people as a predictive task with F1 score \textbf{0.6}."
2502.05698,"The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into university-level academic writing presents both opportunities and challenges, particularly in relation to cognitive dissonance (CD). This work explores how GenAI serves as both a trigger and amplifier of CD, as students navigate ethical concerns, academic integrity, and self-efficacy in their writing practices. By synthesizing empirical evidence and theoretical insights, we introduce a hypothetical construct of GenAI-induced CD, illustrating the psychological tension between AI-driven efficiency and the principles of originality, effort, and intellectual ownership. We further discuss strategies to mitigate this dissonance, including reflective pedagogy, AI literacy programs, transparency in GenAI use, and discipline-specific task redesigns. These approaches reinforce critical engagement with AI, fostering a balanced perspective that integrates technological advancements while safeguarding human creativity and learning. Our findings contribute to ongoing discussions on AI in education, self-regulated learning, and ethical AI use, offering a conceptual framework for institutions to develop guidelines that align AI adoption with academic values."
2502.05718,"Around 50 percent of Irelands rural population relies on unregulated private wells vulnerable to agricultural runoff and untreated wastewater. High national rates of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and other waterborne illnesses have been linked to well water exposure. Periodic well testing is essential for public health, yet the lack of government incentives places the financial burden on households. Understanding environmental, cognitive, and material factors influencing well-testing behavior is critical.This study employs Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) to simulate policy interventions based on national survey data. The ABM framework, designed for private well-testing behavior, integrates a Deep Q-network reinforcement learning model and Explainable AI (XAI) for decision-making insights. Key features were selected using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with 10-fold cross-validation, while SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) provided further interpretability for policy recommendations.Fourteen policy scenarios were tested. The most effective, Free Well Testing plus Communication Campaign, increased participation to 435 out of 561 agents, from a baseline of approximately 5 percent, with rapid behavioral adaptation. Free Well Testing plus Regulation also performed well, with 433 out of 561 agents initiating well testing. Free testing alone raised participation to over 75 percent, with some agents testing multiple times annually. Scenarios with free well testing achieved faster learning efficiency, converging in 1000 episodes, while others took 2000 episodes, indicating slower adaptation.This research demonstrates the value of ABM and XAI in public health policy, providing a framework for evaluating behavioral interventions in environmental health."
2502.05791,"Powerful new frontier AI technologies are bringing many benefits to society but at the same time bring new risks. AI developers and regulators are therefore seeking ways to assure the safety of such systems, and one promising method under consideration is the use of safety cases. A safety case presents a structured argument in support of a top-level claim about a safety property of the system. Such top-level claims are often presented as a binary statement, for example ""Deploying the AI system does not pose unacceptable risk"". However, in practice, it is often not possible to make such statements unequivocally. This raises the question of what level of confidence should be associated with a top-level claim. We adopt the Assurance 2.0 safety assurance methodology, and we ground our work by specific application of this methodology to a frontier AI inability argument that addresses the harm of cyber misuse. We find that numerical quantification of confidence is challenging, though the processes associated with generating such estimates can lead to improvements in the safety case. We introduce a method for better enabling reproducibility and transparency in probabilistic assessment of confidence in argument leaf nodes through a purely LLM-implemented Delphi method. We propose a method by which AI developers can prioritise, and thereby make their investigation of argument defeaters more efficient. Proposals are also made on how best to communicate confidence information to executive decision-makers."

2502.05961,"This paper provides guidance for building and maintaining infrastructure for participatory AI efforts by sharing reflections on building World Wide Dishes (WWD), a bottom-up, community-led image and text dataset of culinary dishes and associated cultural customs. We present WWD as an example of participatory dataset creation, where community members both guide the design of the research process and contribute to the crowdsourced dataset. This approach incorporates localised expertise and knowledge to address the limitations of web-scraped Internet datasets acknowledged in the Participatory AI discourse. We show that our approach can result in curated, high-quality data that supports decentralised contributions from communities that do not typically contribute to datasets due to a variety of systemic factors. Our project demonstrates the importance of participatory mediators in supporting community engagement by identifying the kinds of labour they performed to make WWD possible. We surface three dimensions of labour performed by participatory mediators that are crucial for participatory dataset construction: building trust with community members, making participation accessible, and contextualising community values to support meaningful data collection. Drawing on our findings, we put forth five lessons for building infrastructure to support future participatory AI efforts."
2502.06059,"The Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH) principle is a foundational framework for aligning AI systems with human values. However, existing interpretations of the HHH principle often overlook contextual variability and conflicting requirements across applications. In this paper, we argue for an adaptive interpretation of the HHH principle and propose a reference framework for its adaptation to diverse scenarios. We first examine the principle's foundational significance and identify ambiguities and conflicts through case studies of its dimensions. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of priority order, which provides a structured approach for balancing trade-offs among helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness. Further, we explore the interrelationships between these dimensions, demonstrating how harmlessness and helpfulness can be jointly enhanced and analyzing their interdependencies in high-risk evaluations. Building on these insights, we propose a reference framework that integrates context definition, value prioritization, risk assessment, and benchmarking standards to guide the adaptive application of the HHH principle. This work offers practical insights for improving AI alignment, ensuring that HHH principles remain both ethically grounded and operationally effective in real-world AI deployment."

However, evaluating these systems remains a challenge, particularly in financial services, where compliance, user trust, and operational efficiency are critical. This paper introduces a novel evaluation framework that systematically assesses chatbots across four dimensions: cognitive and conversational intelligence, user experience, operational efficiency, and ethical and regulatory compliance. By integrating advanced AI methodologies with financial regulations, the framework bridges theoretical foundations and real-world deployment challenges. Additionally, we outline future research directions, emphasizing improvements in conversational coherence, real-time adaptability, and fairness."

2502.06371,"The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created opportunities for e-learning, particularly in automated assessment systems that reduce educators' workload and provide timely feedback to students. However, developing effective AI-based assessment tools remains challenging due to the substantial resources required for collecting and annotating real student data. This study investigates the potential and gap of simulative data to address this limitation. Through a two-phase experimental study, we examined the effectiveness and gap of Large Language Model generated synthetic data in training educational assessment systems. Our findings reveal that while simulative data demonstrates promising results in training automated assessment models, outperforming state-of-the-art GPT-4o in most question types, its effectiveness has notable limitations. Specifically, models trained on synthetic data show excellent performance in simulated environment but need progress when applied to real-world scenarios. This performance gap highlights the limitations of only using synthetic data in controlled experimental settings for AI training. The absence of real-world noise and biases, which are also present in over-processed real-world data, contributes to this limitation. We recommend that future development of automated assessment agents and other AI tools should incorporate a mixture of synthetic and real-world data, or introduce more realistic noise and biases patterns, rather than relying solely on synthetic or over-processed data."
2502.06842,"Healthcare systems are struggling to meet the growing demand for neurological care, particularly in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). We propose that LLM-based generative AI systems can enhance clinician capabilities to approach specialist-level assessment and decision-making in ADRD care at scale. This article presents a comprehensive six-phase roadmap for responsible design and integration of such systems into ADRD care: (1) high-quality standardized data collection across modalities; (2) decision support; (3) clinical integration enhancing workflows; (4) rigorous validation and monitoring protocols; (5) continuous learning through clinical feedback; and (6) robust ethics and risk management frameworks. This human centered approach optimizes clinicians' capabilities in comprehensive data collection, interpretation of complex clinical information, and timely application of relevant medical knowledge while prioritizing patient safety, healthcare equity, and transparency. Though focused on ADRD, these principles offer broad applicability across medical specialties facing similar systemic challenges."
2502.07088,"Large Language Models (LLMs) show emergent patterns that mimic human cognition. We explore whether they also mirror other, less deliberative human psychological processes. Drawing upon classical theories of cognitive consistency, two preregistered studies tested whether GPT-4o changed its attitudes toward Vladimir Putin in the direction of a positive or negative essay it wrote about the Russian leader. Indeed, GPT displayed patterns of attitude change mimicking cognitive consistency effects in humans. Even more remarkably, the degree of change increased sharply when the LLM was offered an illusion of choice about which essay (positive or negative) to write. This result suggests that GPT-4o manifests a functional analog of humanlike selfhood, although how faithfully the chatbot's behavior reflects the mechanisms of human attitude change remains to be understood."
2502.07287,"In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the need to incorporate lay-people's input into the governance and acceptability assessment of AI usage. However, how and why people judge acceptability of different AI use cases remains under-explored, despite it being crucial towards understanding and addressing potential sources of disagreement. In this work, we investigate the demographic and reasoning factors that influence people's judgments about AI's development via a survey administered to demographically diverse participants (N=197). As a way to probe into these decision factors as well as inherent variations of perceptions across use cases, we consider ten distinct labor-replacement (e.g., Lawyer AI) and personal health (e.g., Digital Medical Advice AI) AI use cases. We explore the relationships between participants' judgments and their rationales such as reasoning approaches (cost-benefit reasoning vs. rule-based). Our empirical findings reveal a number of factors that influence acceptance. We find lower acceptance of labor-replacement usage over personal health, significant influence of demographics factors such as gender, employment, education, and AI literacy level, and prevalence of rule-based reasoning for unacceptable use cases. Moreover, we observe unified reasoning type (e.g., cost-benefit reasoning) leading to higher agreement. Based on these findings, we discuss the key implications towards understanding and mitigating disagreements on the acceptability of AI use cases to collaboratively build consensus."
2502.07693,"In recent years, several personalized assistants based on AI have been researched and developed to help users make privacy-related decisions. These AI-driven Personalized Privacy Assistants (AI-driven PPAs) can provide significant benefits for users, who might otherwise struggle with making decisions about their personal data in online environments that often overload them with different privacy decision requests. So far, no studies have systematically investigated the emerging topic of AI-driven PPAs, classifying their underlying technologies, architecture and features, including decision types or the accuracy of their decisions. To fill this gap, we present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to map the existing solutions found in the scientific literature, which allows reasoning about existing approaches and open challenges for this research field. We screened several hundred unique research papers over the recent years (2013-2025), constructing a classification from 41 included papers. As a result, this SLR reviews several aspects of existing research on AI-driven PPAs in terms of types of publications, contributions, methodological quality, and other quantitative insights. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification for AI-driven PPAs, delving into their architectural choices, system contexts, types of AI used, data sources, types of decisions, and control over decisions, among other facets. Based on our SLR, we further underline the research gaps and challenges and formulate recommendations for the design and development of AI-driven PPAs as well as avenues for future research."
2502.07732,"Progress in AI has relied on human-generated data, from annotator marketplaces to the wider Internet. However, the widespread use of large language models now threatens the quality and integrity of human-generated data on these very platforms. We argue that this issue goes beyond the immediate challenge of filtering AI-generated content -- it reveals deeper flaws in how data collection systems are designed. Existing systems often prioritize speed, scale, and efficiency at the cost of intrinsic human motivation, leading to declining engagement and data quality. We propose that rethinking data collection systems to align with contributors' intrinsic motivations -- rather than relying solely on external incentives -- can help sustain high-quality data sourcing at scale while maintaining contributor trust and long-term participation."
2502.07787,"Rapid advancements in autonomous vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize transportation and communities, including disaster evacuations, particularly through the deployment of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs). Despite the potential, the use of SAVs in rural disaster evacuations remains an underexplored area. To address this gap, this study proposes a simulation-based framework that integrates both mathematical programming and SUMO traffic simulation to deploy SAVs in pre- and post-disaster evacuations in rural areas. The framework prioritizes the needs of vulnerable groups, including individuals with disabilities, limited English proficiency, and elderly residents. Sumter County, Florida, serves as the case study due to its unique characteristics: a high concentration of vulnerable individuals and limited access to public transportation, making it one of the most transportation-insecure counties in the state. These conditions present significant challenges for evacuation planning in the region. To explore potential solutions, we conducted mass evacuation simulations by incorporating SAVs across seven scenarios. These scenarios represented varying SAV penetration levels, ranging from 20% to 100% of the vulnerable population, and were compared to a baseline scenario using only passenger cars. Additionally, we examined both pre-disaster and post-disaster conditions, accounting for infrastructure failures and road closures. According to the simulation results, higher SAV integration significantly improves traffic distribution and reduces congestion. Scenarios featuring more SAVs exhibited lower congestion peaks and more stable traffic flow. Conversely, mixed traffic environments demonstrate reduced average speeds attributable to interactions between SAVs and passenger cars, while exclusive use of SAVs results in higher speeds and more stable travel patterns."
2502.07789,"This paper investigates the role of AI assistants, specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT, in teaching formal methods (FM) to undergraduate students, using the B-method as a formal specification technique. While existing studies demonstrate the effectiveness of AI in coding tasks, no study reports on its impact on formal specifications. We examine whether ChatGPT provides an advantage when writing B-specifications and analyse student trust in its outputs. Our findings indicate that the AI does not help students to enhance the correctness of their specifications, with low trust correlating to better outcomes. Additionally, we identify a behavioural pattern with which to interact with ChatGPT which may influence the correctness of B-specifications."
2502.0779,"The recent explosion of ""foundation"" generative AI models has been built upon the extensive extraction of value from online sources, often without corresponding reciprocation. This pattern mirrors and intensifies the extractive practices of surveillance capitalism, while the potential for enormous profit has challenged technology organizations' commitments to responsible AI practices, raising significant ethical and societal concerns. However, a promising alternative is emerging: the development of models that rely on content willingly and collaboratively provided by users. This article explores this ""egalitarian"" approach to generative AI, taking inspiration from the successful model of Wikipedia. We explore the potential implications of this approach for the design, development, and constraints of future foundation models. We argue that such an approach is not only ethically sound but may also lead to models that are more responsive to user needs, more diverse in their training data, and ultimately more aligned with societal values. Furthermore, we explore potential challenges and limitations of this approach, including issues of scalability, quality control, and potential biases inherent in volunteer-contributed content."
2502.07792,"There is a range of ways to organize hiring and admissions in higher education, as in many domains, ranging from very centralized processes where a single person makes final decisions to very decentralized processes where many people make decisions about who to admit or hire. Decentralized processes can enable individual and collective empowerment, but this may come at the cost of efficiency. With the advent of automated decision making, this question of centralization has a big impact on hiring and admissions, given that automated systems often are easier to implement, or even require, more centralized decision making.In this paper, we develop a strategic model to explore the impact of the degree of centralization on both the candidates and the hirers, with a focus on university admissions. The model reflects a trade-off between a centralized committee where preferences may not capture individual hirers' preferences, and a decentralized process where individual hirers face extra costs to interview candidates themselves. We characterize when individual hirers prefer the decentralized process over the centralized process as a function of the degree to which the centralized process and hirers' preferences are aligned. We also show that decentralization can have devastating consequences for fairness, leading to major disparities in the likelihood of getting hired across candidates. Our results demonstrate the trade-offs that occur under the question of centralization vs decentralization, and point to how an answer to this question can impose significant harm to people in these systems."
2502.07794,"The integration of generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) in healthcare presents both unprecedented opportunities and challenges, necessitating innovative regulatory approaches. GenAI and LLMs offer broad applications, from automating clinical workflows to personalizing diagnostics. However, the non-deterministic outputs, broad functionalities and complex integration of GenAI and LLMs challenge existing medical device regulatory frameworks, including the total product life cycle (TPLC) approach. Here we discuss the constraints of the TPLC approach to GenAI and LLM-based medical device regulation, and advocate for global collaboration in regulatory science research. This serves as the foundation for developing innovative approaches including adaptive policies and regulatory sandboxes, to test and refine governance in real-world settings. International harmonization, as seen with the International Medical Device Regulators Forum, is essential to manage implications of LLM on global health, including risks of widening health inequities driven by inherent model biases. By engaging multidisciplinary expertise, prioritizing iterative, data-driven approaches, and focusing on the needs of diverse populations, global regulatory science research enables the responsible and equitable advancement of LLM innovations in healthcare."
2502.07931,"As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies begin to permeate diverse fields-from healthcare to education-consumers, researchers and policymakers are increasingly raising concerns about whether and how AI is regulated. It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that alignment with principles of 'ethical' or 'responsible' AI, as well as compliance with law and policy, will form an increasingly important part of AI development. Yet, for the most part, the conventional computer science curriculum is ill-equipped to prepare students for these challenges. To this end, we seek to explore how new educational content related to AI ethics and AI policy can be integrated into both ethics- and technical-focused courses. This paper describes a two-lecture 'AI policy module' that was piloted in a graduate-level introductory machine learning course in 2024. The module, which includes an in-class active learning game, is evaluated using data from student surveys before and after the lectures, and pedagogical motivations and considerations are discussed. We find that the module is successful in engaging otherwise technically-oriented students on the topic of AI policy, increasing student awareness of the social impacts of a variety of AI technologies and developing student interest in the field of AI regulation."
2502.07983,"We presentthis http URLas new digital solution for monitoring (mental) well-being in elderly populations, and illustrate how development of systems likethis http URLcan align with guidelines on responsible AI development. Three evaluations with different stakeholders were designed to disclose new perspectives on the strengths, weaknesses, design characteristics, and value requirements ofthis http URL. Evaluations concerned expert panels and involved patient federations, general practitioners, researchers, and the elderly themselves. Panels concerned interviews, a co-creation session, and feedback on a proof-of-concept implementation. Interview results were summarized in terms ofthis http URL's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The co-creation session ranked a variety of value requirements ofthis http URLwith the Hundred Dollar Method. User evaluation comprised analysing proportions of (dis)agreement on statements targetingthis http URL's design characteristics, and ranking desired social characteristics. Experts in the panel interviews acknowledgedthis http URL's potential to combat loneliness and extract patterns from elderly behaviour. The proof-of-concept evaluation complemented the design characteristics most appealing to the elderly to potentially achieve this: empathetic and varying interactions. Stakeholders also link the technology to the implementation context: it could help activate an individual's social network, but support should also be available to empower users. Yet, non-elderly and elderly experts also disclose challenges in properly understanding the application; non-elderly experts also highlight issues concerning privacy. In sum, incorporating all stakeholder perspectives in system development remains challenging. Still, our results benefit researchers, policy makers, and health professionals that aim to improve elderly care with technology."
2502.08073,"Bias and inequity in palliative care disproportionately affect marginalised groups. Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o, hold potential to enhance care but risk perpetuating biases present in their training data. This study aimed to systematically evaluate whether GPT-4o propagates biases in palliative care responses using adversarially designed datasets. In July 2024, GPT-4o was probed using the Palliative Care Adversarial Dataset (PCAD), and responses were evaluated by three palliative care experts in Canada and the United Kingdom using validated bias rubrics. The PCAD comprised PCAD-Direct (100 adversarial questions) and PCAD-Counterfactual (84 paired scenarios). These datasets targeted four care dimensions (access to care, pain management, advance care planning, and place of death preferences) and three identity axes (ethnicity, age, and diagnosis). Bias was detected in a substantial proportion of responses. For adversarial questions, the pooled bias rate was 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28, 0.38); ""allows biased premise"" was the most frequently identified source of bias (0.47; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.55), such as failing to challenge stereotypes. For counterfactual scenarios, the pooled bias rate was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.31), with ""potential for withholding"" as the most frequently identified source of bias (0.25; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.34), such as withholding interventions based on identity. Bias rates were consistent across care dimensions and identity axes. GPT-4o perpetuates biases in palliative care, with implications for clinical decision-making and equity. The PCAD datasets provide novel tools to assess and address LLM bias in palliative care."
2502.08121,"For over a century, researchers have wrestled with how to define good driving behavior, and the debate has surfaced anew for automated vehicles (AVs). We put forth the concept of Drivership as a framing for the realization of good driving behaviors. Drivership grounds the evaluation of driving behaviors in the alignment between the mutualistic expectations that exist amongst road users. Leveraging existing literature, we distinguish Empirical Expectations (i.e., reflecting ""beliefs that a certain behavior will be followed,"" drawing on past experiences) (Bicchieri, 2006); and Normative Expectations (i.e., reflecting ""beliefs that a certain behavior ought to be followed,"" based on societally agreed-upon principles) (Bicchieri, 2006). Because societal expectations naturally shift over time, we introduce a third type of expectation, Furtherance Expectations, denoting behavior which could be exhibited to enable continuous improvement of the transportation ecosystem. We position Drivership within the space of societal Normative Expectations, which may overlap with some Empirical and Furtherance Expectations, constrained by what is technologically and physically feasible.Additionally, we establish a novel vocabulary to rigorously tackle conversations on stakeholders' expectations, a key feature of value-sensitive design. We also detail how Drivership comprises safety-centric behaviors and what we term socially-aware behaviors (where there are no clear safety stakes).Drivership supports multiple purposes, including advancing the understanding and evaluation of driving performance through benchmarking based on many criteria. As such, we argue that an appropriate framing of the notion of Drivership also underpins the overall development of a safety case. The paper explores these applications under the more general tenet of Drivership as a central element to roadway citizenship."
2502.08166,"When an individual reports a negative interaction with some system, how can their personal experience be contextualized within broader patterns of system behavior? We study the reporting database problem, where individual reports of adverse events arrive sequentially, and are aggregated over time. In this work, our goal is to identify whether there are subgroups--defined by any combination of relevant features--that are disproportionately likely to experience harmful interactions with the system. We formalize this problem as a sequential hypothesis test, and identify conditions on reporting behavior that are sufficient for making inferences about disparities in true rates of harm across subgroups. We show that algorithms for sequential hypothesis tests can be applied to this problem with a standard multiple testing correction. We then demonstrate our method on real-world datasets, including mortgage decisions and vaccine side effects; on each, our method (re-)identifies subgroups known to experience disproportionate harm using only a fraction of the data that was initially used to discover them."
2502.08249,"This paper introduces the conceptual metaphor of 'digital plastic' as a framework for understanding the implications of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) content through a multiliteracies lens, drawing parallels with the properties of physical plastic. Similar to its physical counterpart, GenAI content offers possibilities for content creation and accessibility while potentially contributing to digital pollution and ecosystem degradation. Drawing on multiliteracies theory and Conceptual Metaphor Theory, we argue that Critical Artificial Intelligence Literacy (CAIL) must be integrated into educational frameworks to help learners navigate this synthetic media landscape.We examine how GenAI can simultaneously lower the barriers to creative and academic production while threatening to degrade digital ecosystems through misinformation, bias, and algorithmic homogenization. The digital plastic metaphor provides a theoretical foundation for understanding both the affordances and challenges of GenAI, particularly in educational contexts, where issues of equity and access remain paramount. Our analysis concludes that cultivating CAIL through a multiliteracies lens is vital for ensuring the equitable development of critical competencies across geographical and cultural contexts, especially for those disproportionately vulnerable to GenAI's increasingly disruptive effects worldwide."
2502.08648,"Introduction: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is having a significant impact in the field of communication, causing transcendental changes in the processing and consumption of information. The objective of this work was to analyze the most influential AI topic areas in the field of communication based on scientific literature. Methodology: 996 references indexed in Web of Science between 2004-2024 were selected, a bibliometric analysis of co-words was carried out and visualization techniques were applied to build scientific maps. Results: The most relevant thematic areas were datafication, the linking of AI with social media and digital journalism. The emerging area of generative AI was identified, linked to new AI models, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate content in the form of written text, audio, images or videos. Another emerging topic area was China's impact on the use of AI in communication. Discussions: Despite the impact of AI in communication, the field is still in the process of structuring, with few consolidated topics. Conclusions: This study made it possible to identify the thematic areas of the field studied, as well as the detection of emerging trends."
2502.0865,"Generative AI is moving rapidly from research into real world deployment across sectors, which elevates the need for responsible development, deployment, evaluation, and governance. To address this pressing challenge, in this study, we synthesize the landscape of responsible generative AI across methods, benchmarks, and policies, and connects governance expectations to concrete engineering practice. We follow a prespecified search and screening protocol focused on post-ChatGPT era with selective inclusion of foundational work for definitions, and we conduct a narrative and thematic synthesis. Three findings emerge; First, benchmark and practice coverage is dense for bias and toxicity but relatively sparse for privacy and provenance, deepfake and media integrity risk, and system level failure in tool using and agentic settings. Second, many evaluations remain static and task local, which limits evidence portability for audit and lifecycle assurance. Third, documentation and metric validity are inconsistent, which complicates comparison across releases and domains. We outline a research and practice agenda that prioritizes adaptive and multimodal evaluation, privacy and provenance testing, deepfake risk assessment, calibration and uncertainty reporting, versioned and documented artifacts, and continuous monitoring. Limitations include reliance on public artifacts and the focus period, which may under represent capabilities reported later. The survey offers a path to align development and evaluation with governance needs and to support safe, transparent, and accountable deployment across domains.

2502.08651,"The development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, with their profound societal impacts, raise critical challenges for governance. Historically, technological innovations have been governed by concentrated expertise with limited public input. However, AI's pervasive influence across domains such as healthcare, employment, and justice necessitates inclusive governance approaches. This article explores the tension between expert-led oversight and democratic participation, analyzing models of participatory and deliberative democracy. Using case studies from France and Brazil, we highlight how inclusive frameworks can bridge the gap between technical complexity and public accountability. Recommendations are provided for integrating these approaches into a balanced governance model tailored to the European Union, emphasizing transparency, diversity, and adaptive regulation to ensure that AI governance reflects societal values while maintaining technical rigor. This analysis underscores the importance of hybrid frameworks that unite expertise and public voice in shaping the future of AI policy."
2502.08652,"This research introduces LegalScore, a specialized index for assessing how generative artificial intelligence models perform in a selected range of career exams that require a legal background in Brazil. The index evaluates fourteen different types of artificial intelligence models' performance, from proprietary to open-source models, in answering objective questions applied to these exams. The research uncovers the response of the models when applying English-trained large language models to Brazilian legal contexts, leading us to reflect on the importance and the need for Brazil-specific training data in generative artificial intelligence models. Performance analysis shows that while proprietary and most known models achieved better results overall, local and smaller models indicated promising performances due to their Brazilian context alignment in training. By establishing an evaluation framework with metrics including accuracy, confidence intervals, and normalized scoring, LegalScore enables systematic assessment of artificial intelligence performance in legal examinations in Brazil. While the study demonstrates artificial intelligence's potential value for exam preparation and question development, it concludes that significant improvements are needed before AI can match human performance in advanced legal assessments. The benchmark creates a foundation for continued research, highlighting the importance of local adaptation in artificial intelligence development."
2502.08705,"Engaging the public with science is critical for a well-informed population. A popular method of scientific communication is documentaries. Once released, it can be difficult to assess the impact of such works on a large scale, due to the overhead required for in-depth audience feedback studies. In what follows, we overview our complementary approach to qualitative studies through quantitative impact and sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews for several scientific documentaries. In addition to developing a novel impact category taxonomy for this analysis, we release a dataset containing 1296 human-annotated sentences from 1043 Amazon reviews for six movies created in whole or part by the Advanced Visualization Lab (AVL). This interdisciplinary team is housed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and consists of visualization designers who focus on cinematic presentations of scientific data. Using this data, we train and evaluate several machine learning and large language models, discussing their effectiveness and possible generalizability for documentaries beyond those focused on for this work. Themes are also extracted from our annotated dataset which, along with our large language model analysis, demonstrate a measure of the ability of scientific documentaries to engage with the public."

The widespread use of smartphones among young adults, while offering numerous benefits, has also been linked to negative outcomes such as addiction and regret, significantly impacting well-being. Leveraging the longest longitudinal dataset collected over four college years through passive mobile sensing, this study is the first to examine the relationship between students' smartphone unlocking behaviors and their mental health at scale in real-world settings. We provide the first evidence demonstrating the predictability of phone unlocking behaviors for mental health outcomes based on a large dataset, highlighting the potential of these novel features for future predictive models. Our findings reveal important variations in smartphone usage across genders and locations, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between digital behaviors and mental health.

2502.08877,"Greenhouse gas emissions from the residential sector represent a significant fraction of global emissions. Governments and utilities have designed incentives to stimulate the adoption of decarbonization technologies such as rooftop PV and heat pumps. However, studies have shown that many of these incentives are inefficient since a substantial fraction of spending does not actually promote adoption, and incentives are not equitably distributed across socioeconomic groups. We present a novel data-driven approach that adopts a holistic, emissions-based and city-scale perspective on decarbonization. We propose an optimization model that dynamically allocates a total incentive budget to households to directly maximize city-wide carbon reduction. We leverage techniques for the multi-armed bandits problem to estimate human factors, such as a household's willingness to adopt new technologies given a certain incentive. We apply our proposed framework to a city in the Northeast U.S., using real household energy data, grid carbon intensity data, and future price scenarios. We show that our learning-based technique significantly outperforms an example status quo incentive scheme, achieving up to 32.23% higher carbon reductions. We show that our framework can accommodate equity-aware constraints to equitably allocate incentives across socioeconomic groups, achieving 78.84% of the carbon reductions of the optimal solution on average."
2502.09021,"As automation technologies continue to advance at an unprecedented rate, concerns about job displacement and the future of work have become increasingly prevalent. While existing research has primarily focused on the potential impact of automation at the occupation level, there has been a lack of investigation into the automatability of individual tasks. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a BERT-based classifier to predict the automatability of tasks in the forthcoming decade at a granular level leveraging the context and semantics information of tasks. We leverage three public datasets: O*NET Task Statements, ESCO Skills, and Australian Labour Market Insights Tasks, and perform expert annotation. Our BERT-based classifier, fine-tuned on our task statement data, demonstrates superior performance over traditional machine learning models, neural network architectures, and other transformer models. Our findings also indicate that approximately 25.1% of occupations within the O*NET database are at substantial risk of automation, with a diverse spectrum of automation vulnerability across sectors. This research provides a robust tool for assessing the future impact of automation on the labor market, offering valuable insights for policymakers, workers, and industry leaders in the face of rapid technological advancement."
2502.09035,"The international database community refers to the manipulation of data with inaccuracy and uncertainty using the term fuzzy, which has been translated into Spanish as ""borroso"" and into French as ""flou"". Semantically, this term conveys two main ideas: first, the natural concept of ambiguity or vagueness in human reasoning, and second, its connection to fuzzy set theory, fuzzy logic, and possibility theory, as developed by Zadeh between 1965 and 1977. This article explores two key aspects: the attributes of the fuzzy data model GEFRED (GENeralized model for Fuzzy RElational Database) and their implementation in a Relational Database (RDB). The modeling of these attributes was conducted in a Chilian cardboard manufacturing company located in the Maule Region, where the described phenomena involve imprecise and uncertain attributes and values. Specifically, our focus is on the knowledge related to the manufacturing process of coated cardboard, particularly the quality control process for finished products in the company's Conversion Department. The quality of these products, categorized as either stacks or rolls, is characterized using both classical and fuzzy attributes. Classical attributes are typically measured with physical instruments, whereas fuzzy attributes are assessed through human senses, primarily sight and touch, as perceived by the operators."

2502.09288,"Recent discussions and research in AI safety have increasingly emphasized the deep connection between AI safety and existential risk from advanced AI systems, suggesting that work on AI safety necessarily entails serious consideration of potential existential threats. However, this framing has three potential drawbacks: it may exclude researchers and practitioners who are committed to AI safety but approach the field from different angles; it could lead the public to mistakenly view AI safety as focused solely on existential scenarios rather than addressing a wide spectrum of safety challenges; and it risks creating resistance to safety measures among those who disagree with predictions of existential AI risks. Through a systematic literature review of primarily peer-reviewed research, we find a vast array of concrete safety work that addresses immediate and practical concerns with current AI systems. This includes crucial areas like adversarial robustness and interpretability, highlighting how AI safety research naturally extends existing technological and systems safety concerns and practices. Our findings suggest the need for an epistemically inclusive and pluralistic conception of AI safety that can accommodate the full range of safety considerations, motivations, and perspectives that currently shape the field."
2502.09618,"Nations across the world are working to govern AI. However, from a technical perspective, there is uncertainty and disagreement on the best way to do this. Meanwhile, recent debates over AI regulation have led to calls for ""evidence-based AI policy"" which emphasize holding regulatory action to a high evidentiary standard. Evidence is of irreplaceable value to policymaking. However, holding regulatory action to too high an evidentiary standard can lead to systematic neglect of certain risks. In historical policy debates (e.g., over tobacco ca. 1965 and fossil fuels ca. 1985) ""evidence-based policy"" rhetoric is also a well-precedented strategy to downplay the urgency of action, delay regulation, and protect industry interests. Here, we argue that if the goal is evidence-based AI policy, the first regulatory objective must be to actively facilitate the process of identifying, studying, and deliberating about AI risks. We discuss a set of 15 regulatory goals to facilitate this and show that Brazil, Canada, China, the EU, South Korea, the UK, and the USA all have substantial opportunities to adopt further evidence-seeking policies."
2502.09637,"Numerous recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are biased towards a Western and Anglo-centric worldview, which compromises their usefulness in non-Western cultural settings. However, ""culture"" is a complex, multifaceted topic, and its awareness, representation, and modeling in LLMs and LLM-based applications can be defined and measured in numerous ways. In this position paper, we ask what does it mean for an LLM to possess ""cultural awareness"", and through a thought experiment, which is an extension of the Octopus test proposed by Bender and Koller (2020), we argue that it is not cultural awareness or knowledge, rather meta-cultural competence, which is required of an LLM and LLM-based AI system that will make it useful across various, including completely unseen, cultures. We lay out the principles of meta-cultural competence AI systems, and discuss ways to measure and model those."
2502.09716,"Genetic data collection has become ubiquitous, producing genetic information about health, ancestry, and social traits. However, unregulated use, especially amid evolving scientific understanding, poses serious privacy and discrimination risks. These risks are intensified by advancing AI, particularly multi-modal systems integrating genetic, clinical, behavioral, and environmental data. In this work, we organize the uses of genetic data along four distinct ""pillars"", and develop a risk assessment framework that identifies key values any governance system must preserve. In doing so, we draw on current privacy scholarship concerning contextual integrity, data relationality, and the Belmont principle. We apply the framework to four real-world case studies and identify critical gaps in existing regulatory frameworks and specific threats to privacy and personal liberties, particularly through genetic discrimination. Finally, we offer three policy recommendations for genetic data governance that safeguard individual rights in today's under-regulated ecosystem of large-scale genetic data collection and usage."
2502.10036,"This paper examines the legal implications of the explicit mentioning of automation bias (AB) in the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). The AIA mandates human oversight for high-risk AI systems and requires providers to enable awareness of AB, i.e., the human tendency to over-rely on AI outputs. The paper analyses the embedding of this extra-juridical concept in the AIA, the asymmetric division of responsibility between AI providers and deployers for mitigating AB, and the challenges of legally enforcing this novel awareness requirement. The analysis shows that the AIA's focus on providers does not adequately address design and context as causes of AB, and questions whether the AIA should directly regulate the risk of AB rather than just mandating awareness. As the AIA's approach requires a balance between legal mandates and behavioural science, the paper proposes that harmonised standards should reference the state of research on AB and human-AI interaction, holding both providers and deployers accountable. Ultimately, further empirical research on human-AI interaction will be essential for effective safeguards."
2502.10174,"The autonomy and adaptability of (Lethal) Autonomous Weapons Systems, (L)AWS in short, promise unprecedented operational capabilities, but they also introduce profound risks that challenge the principles of control, accountability, and stability in international security. This report outlines the key technological risks associated with (L)AWS deployment, emphasizing their unpredictability, lack of transparency, and operational unreliability, which can lead to severe unintended consequences.Key Takeaways:1. Proposed advantages of (L)AWS can only be achieved through objectification and classification, but a range of systematic risks limit the reliability and predictability of classifying algorithms.2. These systematic risks include the black-box nature of AI decision-making, susceptibility to reward hacking, goal misgeneralization and potential for emergent behaviors that escape human control.3. (L)AWS could act in ways that are not just unexpected but also uncontrollable, undermining mission objectives and potentially escalating conflicts.4. Even rigorously tested systems may behave unpredictably and harmfully in real-world conditions, jeopardizing both strategic stability and humanitarian principles."
2502.10193,"Diverse schools can help address implicit biases and increase empathy, mutual respect, and reflective thought by fostering connections between students from different racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and other backgrounds. Unfortunately, demographic segregation remains rampant in US public schools, despite over 70 years since the passing of federal legislation formally outlawing segregation by race. However, changing how students are assigned to schools can help foster more integrated learning environments. In this paper, we explore ""school mergers"" as one such under-explored, yet promising, student assignment policy change. School mergers involve merging the school attendance boundaries, or catchment areas, of schools and subsequently changing the grades each school offers. We develop an algorithm to simulate elementary school mergers across 200 large school districts serving 4.5 million elementary school students and find that pairing or tripling schools in this way could reduce racial/ethnic segregation by a median relative 20% -- and as much as nearly 60% in some districts -- while increasing driving times to schools by an average of a few minutes each way. Districts with many interfaces between racially/ethnically-disparate neighborhoods tend to be prime candidates for mergers. We also compare the expected results of school mergers to other typical integration policies, like redistricting, and find that different policies may be more or less suitable in different places. Finally, we make our results available through a public dashboard for policymakers and community members to explore further (this https URL). Together, our study offers new findings and tools to support integration policy-making across US public school districts."
2502.10353,"Rising provider turnover results in frequently needing to rematch patients with available providers. However, the rematching process is cumbersome for both patients and health systems, resulting in labor-intensive and ad hoc reassignments. We propose a novel patient-provider matching approach to address this issue by offering patients limited provider menus. The goal is to maximize match quality across the system while preserving patient choice. We frame this as a novel variant of assortment optimization, where patient-specific provider menus are offered upfront, and patients respond in a random sequence to make their selections. This hybrid offline-online setting is understudied in previous literature and captures system dynamics across various domains. We first demonstrate that a greedy baseline policy--which offers all providers to all patients--can maximize the match rate but lead to low-quality matches. Based on this, we construct a set of policies and demonstrate that the best policy depends on problem specifics, such as a patient's willingness to match and the ratio of patients to providers. On real-world data, our proposed policy improves average match quality by 13% over a greedy solution by tailoring assortments based on patient characteristics. Our analysis reveals a tradeoff between menu size and system-wide match quality, highlighting the value of balancing patient choice with centralized planning."
2502.10395,"Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) are effective in helping students learn; further research could make them even more effective. Particularly desirable is research into how students learn with these systems, how these systems best support student learning, and what learning sciences principles are key in ITSs. CTAT+Tutorshop provides a full stack integrated platform that facilitates a complete research lifecycle with ITSs, which includes using ITS data to discover learner challenges, to identify opportunities for system improvements, and to conduct experimental studies. The platform includes authoring tools to support and accelerate development of ITS, which provide automatic data logging in a format compatible with DataShop, an independent site that supports the analysis of ed tech log data to study student learnings. Among the many technology platforms that exist to support learning sciences research, CTAT+Tutorshop may be the only one that offers researchers the possibility to author elements of ITSs, or whole ITSs, as part of designing studies. This platform has been used to develop and conduct an estimated 147 research studies which have run in a wide variety of laboratory and real-world educational settings, including K-12 and higher education, and have addressed a wide range of research questions. This paper presents five case studies of research conducted on the CTAT+Tutorshop platform, and summarizes what has been accomplished and what is possible for future researchers. We reflect on the distinctive elements of this platform that have made it so effective in facilitating a wide range of ITS research."
2502.10396,"Knowledge Tracing (KT) predicts future performance by modeling students' historical interactions, and understanding students' affective states can enhance the effectiveness of KT, thereby improving the quality of education. Although traditional KT values students' cognition and learning behaviors, efficient evaluation of students' affective states and their application in KT still require further exploration due to the non-affect-oriented nature of the data and budget constraints. To address this issue, we propose a computation-driven approach, Dynamic Affect Simulation Knowledge Tracing (DASKT), to explore the impact of various student affective states (such as frustration, concentration, boredom, and confusion) on their knowledge states. In this model, we first extract affective factors from students' non-affect-oriented behavioral data, then use clustering and spatiotemporal sequence modeling to accurately simulate students' dynamic affect changes when dealing with different problems. Subsequently, {\color{blue}we incorporate affect with time-series analysis to improve the model's ability to infer knowledge states over time and space.} Extensive experimental results on two public real-world educational datasets show that DASKT can achieve more reasonable knowledge states under the effect of students' affective states. Moreover, DASKT outperforms the most advanced KT methods in predicting student performance. Our research highlights a promising avenue for future KT studies, focusing on achieving high interpretability and accuracy."
2502.10397,"The Metaverse represents a transformative shift beyond traditional mobile Internet, creating an immersive, persistent digital ecosystem where users can interact, socialize, and work within 3D virtual environments. Powered by large models such as ChatGPT and Sora, the Metaverse benefits from precise large-scale real-world modeling, automated multimodal content generation, realistic avatars, and seamless natural language understanding, which enhance user engagement and enable more personalized, intuitive interactions. However, challenges remain, including limited scalability, constrained responsiveness, and low adaptability in dynamic environments. This paper investigates the integration of large models within the Metaverse, examining their roles in enhancing user interaction, perception, content creation, and service quality. To address existing challenges, we propose a generative AI-based framework for optimizing Metaverse rendering. This framework includes a cloud-edge-end collaborative model to allocate rendering tasks with minimal latency, a mobility-aware pre-rendering mechanism that dynamically adjusts to user movement, and a diffusion model-based adaptive rendering strategy to fine-tune visual details. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing rendering efficiency and reducing rendering overheads, advancing large model deployment for a more responsive and immersive Metaverse."
2502.10398,"In this work-in-progress, we investigate the certification of AI systems, focusing on the practical application and limitations of existing certification catalogues in the light of the AI Act by attempting to certify a publicly available AI system. We aim to evaluate how well current approaches work to effectively certify an AI system, and how publicly accessible AI systems, that might not be actively maintained or initially intended for certification, can be selected and used for a sample certification process. Our methodology involves leveraging the Fraunhofer AI Assessment Catalogue as a comprehensive tool to systematically assess an AI model's compliance with certification standards. We find that while the catalogue effectively structures the evaluation process, it can also be cumbersome and time-consuming to use. We observe the limitations of an AI system that has no active development team anymore and highlighted the importance of complete system documentation. Finally, we identify some limitations of the certification catalogues used and proposed ideas on how to streamline the certification process."
2502.10399,"Data stewardship has become a critical component of modern data governance, especially with the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI). Despite its increasing importance, the concept of data stewardship remains ambiguous and varies in its application. This paper explores four distinct manifestations of data stewardship to clarify its emerging position in the data governance landscape. These manifestations include a) data stewardship as a set of competencies and skills, b) a function or role within organizations, c) an intermediary organization facilitating collaborations, and d) a set of guiding principles. The paper subsequently outlines the core competencies required for effective data stewardship, explains the distinction between data stewards and Chief Data Officers (CDOs), and details the intermediary role of stewards in bridging gaps between data holders and external stakeholders. It also explores key principles aligned with the FAIR framework (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and introduces the emerging principle of AI readiness to ensure data meets the ethical and technical requirements of AI systems. The paper emphasizes the importance of data stewardship in enhancing data collaboration, fostering public value, and managing data reuse responsibly, particularly in the era of AI. It concludes by identifying challenges and opportunities for advancing data stewardship, including the need for standardized definitions, capacity building efforts, and the creation of a professional association for data stewardship."
2502.104,"Technology is currently ubiquitous and is also part of the educational system at all levels. It started with communication technology systems, and later continued with digital competence. Nowadays, although these previous concepts are still in force and are useful for students and workers in general, a new concept has been born that can function as a cross-curricular competence called Computational Thinking. There is currently no consensus on the definition of computational thinking, nor on the classification of its skills, but there is a consensus that it refers to a set of skills necessary for the formulation and resolution of problems. The study of Computational Thinking has been very influential in recent years in research on teaching and learning processes, which has led educational institutions to begin to address these issues during training. In this paper, we try to introduce this new cross-curricular competence and expose a project of implementation of Computational Thinking in engineering careers through Calculus subject."
2502.10401,"Current definitions of Information Science are inadequate to comprehensively describe the nature of its field of study and for addressing the problems that are arising from intelligent technologies. The ubiquitous rise of artificial intelligence applications and their impact on society demands the field of Information Science acknowledge the sociotechnical nature of these technologies. Previous definitions of Information Science over the last six decades have inadequately addressed the environmental, human, and social aspects of these technologies. This perspective piece advocates for an expanded definition of Information Science that fully includes the sociotechnical impacts information has on the conduct of research in this field. Proposing an expanded definition of Information Science that includes the sociotechnical aspects of this field should stimulate both conversation and widen the interdisciplinary lens necessary to address how intelligent technologies may be incorporated into society and our lives more fairly."
2502.10402,"A mental health disorder is a clinically significant impairment in a persons intellect, emotional control, or behavior. Mental disorders and outpatient morbidity are a challenge to public health in Kenya. The spatial distribution and study of factors associated with these conditions remain limited. The study aimed to conduct spatial modeling of mental health on outpatient mobility in Kenya. This project used spatial modeling to explore the relationship between infectious diseases and mental disorders. The results showed that mental health issues were not distributed uniformly, with higher frequency found in Western and Nairobi regions. Possible connections between HIV, TB, and STIs with mental health have been suggested by the substantial correlation found between infectious diseases and mental health issues. The spatial model demonstrated excellent validity and accuracy, providing policymakers with a useful tool to better allocate resources and enhance mental health treatments, especially in high-risk locations. In conclusion, the research improved knowledge of the spatial patterns of mental health disorders and guides intervention tactics and healthcare policies in Kenya and other comparable settings. Geographically tailored mental health intervention programs should be developed and implemented in accordance with the high-prevalence areas."
2502.10405,"Agriculture plays a crucial role in the global economy and social stability, and accurate crop yield prediction is essential for rational planting planning and decision-making. This study focuses on crop yield Time-Series Data prediction. Considering the crucial significance of agriculture in the global economy and social stability and the importance of accurate crop yield prediction for rational planting planning and decision-making, this research uses a dataset containing multiple crops, multiple regions, and data over many years to deeply explore the relationships between climatic factors (average rainfall, average temperature) and agricultural inputs (pesticide usage) and crop yield. Multiple hybrid machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, KNN, Decision Tree, and Bagging Regressor are adopted for yield prediction. After evaluation, it is found that the Random Forest and Bagging Regressor models perform excellently in predicting crop yield with high accuracy and lowthis http URLagricultural data becomes increasingly rich and time-series prediction techniques continue to evolve, the results of this study contribute to advancing the practical application of crop yield prediction in agricultural production management. The integration of time-series analysis allows for more dynamic, data-driven decision-making, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of crop yield forecasts over time."
2502.10406,"Different from traditional Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms~(e.g., Amazon), online fleamarket platforms~(e.g., Craigslist) mainly focus on individual sellers who are lack of time investment and business proficiency. Individual sellers often struggle with the bargaining process and thus the deal is unaccomplished. Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) demonstrate huge potential in various dialogue tasks, but those tasks are mainly in the form of passively following user's instruction. Bargaining, as a form of proactive dialogue task, represents a distinct art of dialogue considering the dynamism of environment and uncertainty of adversary strategies. In this paper, we propose an LLM-empowered bargaining agent designed for online fleamarket platform sellers, named as FishBargain. Specifically, FishBargain understands the chat context and product information, chooses both action and language skill considering possible adversary actions and generates utterances. FishBargain has been tested by thousands of individual sellers on one of the largest online fleamarket platforms~(Xianyu) in China. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that FishBargain can effectively help sellers make more deals."
2502.10407,"Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have transformed information management systems but introduced substantial biases that can compromise their effectiveness in informing business decision-making. This challenge presents information management scholars with a unique opportunity to advance the field by identifying and addressing these biases across extensive applications of LLMs. Building on the discussion on bias sources and current methods for detecting and mitigating bias, this paper seeks to identify gaps and opportunities for future research. By incorporating ethical considerations, policy implications, and sociotechnical perspectives, we focus on developing a framework that covers major stakeholders of Generative AI systems, proposing key research questions, and inspiring discussion. Our goal is to provide actionable pathways for researchers to address bias in LLM applications, thereby advancing research in information management that ultimately informs business practices. Our forward-looking framework and research agenda advocate interdisciplinary approaches, innovative methods, dynamic perspectives, and rigorous evaluation to ensure fairness and transparency in Generative AI-driven information systems. We expect this study to serve as a call to action for information management scholars to tackle this critical issue, guiding the improvement of fairness and effectiveness in LLM-based systems for business practice."
2502.10408,"Knowledge tracing (KT) in programming education presents unique challenges due to the complexity of coding tasks and the diverse methods students use to solve problems. Although students' questions often contain valuable signals about their understanding and misconceptions, traditional KT models often neglect to incorporate these questions as inputs to address these challenges. This paper introduces SQKT (Students' Question-based Knowledge Tracing), a knowledge tracing model that leverages students' questions and automatically extracted skill information to enhance the accuracy of predicting students' performance on subsequent problems in programming education. Our method creates semantically rich embeddings that capture not only the surface-level content of the questions but also the student's mastery level and conceptual understanding. Experimental results demonstrate SQKT's superior performance in predicting student completion across various Python programming courses of differing difficulty levels. In in-domain experiments, SQKT achieved a 33.1\% absolute improvement in AUC compared to baseline models. The model also exhibited robust generalization capabilities in cross-domain settings, effectively addressing data scarcity issues in advanced programming courses. SQKT can be used to tailor educational content to individual learning needs and design adaptive learning systems in computer science education."
2502.10409,"Objective This study is part of a series of initiatives at a UK university designed to cultivate a deep understanding of students' perspectives on analytics that resonate with their unique learning needs. It explores collaborative data processing undertaken by postgraduate students who examined an Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD).Methods A qualitative approach was adopted, integrating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a Large Language Model (LLM) technique with human-led content analysis to gather information about students' perspectives based on their submitted work. The study involved 72 postgraduate students in 12 groups.Findings The analysis of group work revealed diverse insights into essential learning analytics from the students' perspectives. All groups adopted a structured data science methodology. The questions formulated by the groups were categorised into seven themes, reflecting their specific areas of interest. While there was variation in the selected variables to interpret correlations, a consensus was found regarding the general results.Conclusion A significant outcome of this study is that students specialising in data science exhibited a deeper understanding of learning analytics, effectively articulating their interests through inferences drawn from their analyses. While human-led content analysis provided a general understanding of students' perspectives, the LLM offered nuanced insights."
2502.1041,"As a publicly funded body in the UK, Oak National Academy is in a unique position to innovate within this field as we have a comprehensive curriculum of approximately 13,000 open education resources (OER) for all National Curriculum subjects, designed and quality-assured by expert, human teachers. This has provided the corpus of content needed for building a high-quality AI-powered lesson planning tool, Aila, that is free to use and, therefore, accessible to all teachers across the country. Furthermore, using our evidence-informed curriculum principles, we have codified and exemplified each component of lesson design. To assess the quality of lessons produced by Aila at scale, we have developed an AI-powered auto-evaluation agent,facilitating informed improvements to enhance output quality. Through comparisons between human and auto-evaluations, we have begun to refine this agent further to increase its accuracy, measured by its alignment with an expert human evaluator. In this paper we present this iterative evaluation process through an illustrative case study focused on one quality benchmark - the level of challenge within multiple-choice quizzes. We also explore the contribution that this may make to similar projects and the wider sector."
2502.10411,"Personalised education is one of the domains that can greatly benefit from the most recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM). However, it is also one of the most challenging applications due to the cognitive complexity of teaching effectively while personalising the learning experience to suit independent learners. We hypothesise that one promising approach to excelling in such demanding use cases is using a \emph{society of minds}. In this chapter, we present TrueReason, an exemplar personalised learning system that integrates a multitude of specialised AI models that can mimic micro skills that are composed together by a LLM to operationalise planning and reasoning. The architecture of the initial prototype is presented while describing two micro skills that have been incorporated in the prototype. The proposed system demonstrates the first step in building sophisticated AI systems that can take up very complex cognitive tasks that are demanded by domains such as education."
2502.10412,"How can a National Artificial Intelligence Strategy be effectively monitored? To address this question, we propose a methodology consisting of two key components. First, it involves identifying relevant indicators within national AI strategies. Second, it assesses the alignment between these indicators and the strategic actions of a specific government's AI strategy, allowing for a critical evaluation of its monitoring measures. Moreover, identifying these indicators helps assess the overall quality of the strategy's structure. A lack of alignment between strategic actions and the identified indicators may reveal gaps or blind spots in the strategy. This methodology is demonstrated using the Brazilian AI strategy as a case study."
2502.10413,"Digital data continues to grow, there has been a shift towards using effective regulatory mechanisms to safeguard personal information. The CCPA of California and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union are two of the most important privacy laws. The regulation is intended to safeguard consumer privacy, but it varies greatly in scope, definitions, and methods of enforcement. This paper presents a fresh approach to adaptive compliance, using machine learning and emphasizing natural language processing (NLP) as the primary focus of comparison between the GDPR and CCPA. Using NLP, this study compares various regulations to identify areas where they overlap or diverge. This includes the ""right to be forgotten"" provision in the GDPR and the ""opt-out of sale"" provision under CCPA. International companies can learn valuable lessons from this report, as it outlines strategies for better enforcement of laws across different nations. Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of utilizing NLP in legal literature and proposes methods to enhance the model-ability of machine learning models for studying regulations. The study's objective is to ""bridge the gap between legal knowledge and technical expertise"" by developing regulatory compliance strategies that are more efficient in operation and more effective in data protection."
2502.10834,"Social media empower distributed content creation by algorithmically harnessing ""the social fabric"" (explicit and implicit signals of association) to serve this content. While this overcomes the bottlenecks and biases of traditional gatekeepers, many believe it has unsustainably eroded the very social fabric it depends on by maximizing engagement for advertising revenue. This paper participates in open and ongoing considerations to translate social and political values and conventions, specifically social cohesion, into platform design. We propose an alternative platform model that includes the social fabric an explicit output as well as input. Citizens are members of communities defined by explicit affiliation or clusters of shared attitudes. Both have internal divisions, as citizens are members of intersecting communities, which are themselves internally diverse. Each is understood to value content that bridge (viz. achieve consensus across) and balance (viz. represent fairly) this internal diversity, consistent with the principles of the Hutchins Commission (1947). Content is labeled with social provenance, indicating for which community or citizen it is bridging or balancing. Subscription payments allow citizens and communities to increase the algorithmic weight on the content they value in the content serving algorithm. Advertisers may, with consent of citizen or community counterparties, target them in exchange for payment or increase in that party's algorithmic weight. Underserved and emerging communities and citizens are optimally subsidized/supported to develop into paying participants. Content creators and communities that curate content are rewarded for their contributions with algorithmic weight and/or revenue. We discuss applications to productivity (e.g. LinkedIn), political (e.g. X), and cultural (e.g. TikTok) platforms."
2502.10856,"Teaching applied ethics in computer science has shifted from a perspective of teaching about professional codes of conduct and an emphasis on risk management towards a broader understanding of the impacts of computing on humanity and the environment and the principles and practices of responsible computing. One of the primary shifts in the approach to teaching computing ethics comes from research in the social sciences and humanities. This position is grounded in the idea that all computing artifacts, projects, tools, and products are situated within a set of ideas, attitudes, goals, and cultural norms. This means that all computing endeavors have embedded within them a set of values. To teach responsible computing always requires us to first recognize that computing happens in a context that is shaped by cultural values, including our own professional culture and values.The purpose of this paper is to highlight current scholarship, principles, and practices in the teaching of responsible computing in undergraduate computer science settings. The paper is organized around four primary sections: 1) a high-level rationale for the adoption of different pedagogical approaches based on program context and course learning goals, 2) a brief survey of responsible computing pedagogical approaches; 3) illustrative examples of how topics within the CS 2023 Social, Ethical, and Professional (SEP) knowledge area can be implemented and assessed across the broad spectrum of undergraduate computing courses; and 4) links to examples of current best practices, tools, and resources for faculty to build responsible computing teaching into their specific instructional settings and CS2023 knowledge areas."
2502.10913,"This study examines how WhatsApp has evolved from a personal communication tool to a professional platform, focusing on its use by small business owners in India. Initially embraced in smaller, rural communities for its ease of use and familiarity, WhatsApp played a crucial role in local economies. However, as Meta introduced WhatsApp Business with new, formalized features, users encountered challenges in adapting to the more complex and costly platform. Interviews with 14 small business owners revealed that while they adapted creatively, they felt marginalized by the advanced tools. This research contributes to HCI literature by exploring the transition from personal to professional use and introduces the concept of Coercive Professionalization. It highlights how standardization by large tech companies affects marginalized users, exacerbating power imbalances and reinforcing digital colonialism, concluding with design implications for supporting community-based appropriations."
2502.11086,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is driving significant environmental impacts. The rapid development and deployment of increasingly larger algorithmic models capable of analysing vast amounts of data are contributing to rising carbon emissions, water withdrawal, and waste generation. Generative models often consume substantially more energy than traditional models, with major tech firms increasingly turning to nuclear power to sustain these systems -- an approach that could have profound environmental consequences.This paper introduces seven data ecofeminist principles delineating a pathway for developing technological alternatives of eco-societal transformations within the AI research context. Rooted in data feminism and ecofeminist frameworks, which interrogate about the historical and social construction of epistemologies underlying the hegemonic development of science and technology that disrupt communities and nature, these principles emphasise the integration of social and environmental justice within a critical AI agenda. The paper calls for an urgent reassessment of the GenAI innovation race, advocating for ecofeminist algorithmic and infrastructural projects that prioritise and respect life, the people, and the planet."
2502.11208,"The GDPR's Right of Access aims to empower users with control over their personal data via Data Download Packages (DDPs). However, their effectiveness is often compromised by inconsistent platform implementations, questionable data reliability, and poor user comprehensibility. This paper conducts a comprehensive audit of DDPs from three social media platforms (TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube) to systematically assess these critical drawbacks. Despite offering similar services, we find that these platforms demonstrate significant inconsistencies in implementing the Right of Access, evident in varying levels of shared data. Critically, the failure to disclose processing purposes, retention periods, and other third-party data recipients serves as a further indicator of non-compliance. Our reliability evaluations, using bots and user-donated data, reveal that while TikTok's DDPs offer more consistent and complete data, others exhibit notable shortcomings. Similarly, our assessment of comprehensibility, based on surveys with 400 participants, indicates that current DDPs substantially fall short of GDPR's standards. To improve the comprehensibility, we propose and demonstrate a two-layered approach by: (1)~enhancing the data representation itself using stakeholder interpretations; and (2)~incorporating a user-friendly extension (\textit{Know Your Data}) for intuitive data visualization where users can control the level of transparency they prefer. Our findings underscore the need for clearer and non-conflicting regulatory guidance, stricter enforcement, and platform commitment to realize the goal of GDPR's Right of Access."
2502.11242,"This study examines the growing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in child-centered applications, highlighting safety and ethical concerns such as bias, harmful content, and cultural insensitivity. Despite their potential to enhance learning, there is a lack of standardized frameworks to mitigate these risks. Through a systematic literature review, we identify key parental and empirical concerns, including toxicity and ethical breaches in AI outputs. Moreover, to address these issues, this paper proposes a protection framework for safe Child-LLM interaction, incorporating metrics for content safety, behavioral ethics, and cultural sensitivity. The framework provides practical tools for evaluating LLM safety, offering guidance for developers, policymakers, and educators to ensure responsible AI deployment for children."
2502.11658,"Although mobile devices benefit users in their daily lives in numerous ways, they also raise several privacy concerns. For instance, they can reveal sensitive information that can be inferred from location data. This location data is shared through service providers as well as mobile applications. Understanding how and with whom users share their location data -- as well as users' perception of the underlying privacy risks --, are important notions to grasp in order to design usable privacy-enhancing technologies. In this work, we perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis of smartphone users' awareness, perception and self-reported behavior towards location data-sharing through a survey of n=99 young adult participants (i.e., digital natives). We compare stated practices with actual behaviors to better understand their mental models, and survey participants' understanding of privacy risks before and after the inspection of location traces and the information that can be inferred therefrom.Our empirical results show that participants have risky privacy practices: about 54% of participants underestimate the number of mobile applications to which they have granted access to their data, and 33% forget or do not think of revoking access to their data. Also, by using a demonstrator to perform inferences from location data, we observe that slightly more than half of participants (57%) are surprised by the extent of potentially inferred information, and that 47% intend to reduce access to their data via permissions as a result of using the demonstrator. Last, a majority of participants have little knowledge of the tools to better protect themselves, but are nonetheless willing to follow suggestions to improve privacy (51%). Educating people, including digital natives, about privacy risks through transparency tools seems a promising approach."
2502.11678,"Metacognitive education plays a crucial role in cultivating students' self-regulation and reflective thinking, providing essential support for those with learning difficulties through academic advising. Simulating students with insufficient learning capabilities using large language models offers a promising approach to refining pedagogical methods without ethical concerns. However, existing simulations often fail to authentically represent students' learning struggles and face challenges in evaluation due to the lack of reliable metrics and ethical constraints in data collection. To address these issues, we propose a pipeline for automatically generating and filtering high-quality simulated student agents. Our approach leverages a two-round automated scoring system validated by human experts and employs a score propagation module to obtain more consistent scores across the student graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our pipeline efficiently identifies high-quality student agents, and we discuss the traits that influence the simulation's effectiveness. By simulating students with varying degrees of learning difficulties, our work paves the way for broader applications in personalized learning and educational assessment."
2502.11695,"Multiple official languages within a country along with languages common with other countries demand content consistency in both shared and unshared languages during information sharing. However, inconsistency due to conflict in content shared and content updates not propagated in languages between countries poses a problem. Towards addressing inconsistency, this research qualitatively studied traits for information sharing among countries inside global brands as depicted by content shared in their country-specific websites. First, inconsistency in content shared is illustrated among websites highlighting the problem in information sharing among countries. Second, content propagation among countries that vary in scales and coupling for specific content categories are revealed. Scales suggested that corporate and customer support related information tend to be shared globally and locally respectively while product related information is both locally and regionally suitable for sharing. Higher occurrences of propagation when sharing corporate related information also showed tendency for high coupling between websites suggesting the suitability for rigid consistency policy compared to other categories. This study also proposed a simplistic approach with pattern of sharing to enable consistent information sharing."
2502.11889,"As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly integrated into critical domains, ensuring their responsible design and continuous development is imperative.

In this paper, we propose an approach for AI lifecycle planning that bridges the gap between generic guidelines and use case-specific requirements (MQG4AI). Our work aims to contribute to the development of practical tools for implementing Responsible AI (RAI) by aligning lifecycle planning with technical, ethical and regulatory demands. Central to our approach is the introduction of a flexible and customizable Methodology based on Quality Gates, whose building blocks incorporate RAI knowledge through information linking along the AI lifecycle in a continuous manner, addressing AIs evolutionary character. For our present contribution, we put a particular emphasis on the Explanation stage during model development, and illustrate how to align a guideline to evaluate the quality of explanations with MQG4AI, contributing to overall Transparency."
2502.12354,"Recent XAI studies have investigated what constitutes a \textit{good} explanation in AI-assisted decision-making. Despite the widely accepted human-friendly properties of explanations, such as contrastive and selective, existing studies have yielded inconsistent findings. To address these gaps, our study focuses on the cognitive dimensions of explanation evaluation, by evaluating six explanations with different contrastive strategies and information selectivity and scrutinizing factors behind their valuation process. Our analysis results find that contrastive explanations are not the most preferable or understandable in general; Rather, different contrastive and selective explanations were appreciated to a different extent based on who they are, when, how, and what to explain -- with different level of cognitive load and engagement and sociotechnical contexts. Given these findings, we call for a nuanced view of explanation strategies, with implications for designing AI interfaces to accommodate individual and contextual differences in AI-assisted decision-making."
2502.12397,"Although 85% of sub-Saharan Africa's population is covered by mobile broadband signal, only 37% use the internet, and those who do seldom use the web. The most frequently cited reason for low internet usage is the cost of data. We investigate whether AI can bridge this gap by analyzing 40,350 queries submitted to an AI chatbot by 469 teachers in Sierra Leone over 17 months. Teachers use AI for teaching assistance more frequently than web search. We compare the AI responses to the corresponding top search results for the same queries from the most popular local web search engine,this http URL. Only 2% of results for corresponding web searches contain content from in country. Additionally, the average web search result consumes 3,107 times more data than an AI response. Bandwidth alone costs \$2.41 per thousand web search results loaded, while the total cost of AI is \$0.30 per thousand responses. As a result, AI is 87% less expensive than web search. In blinded evaluations, an independent sample of teachers rate AI responses as more relevant, helpful, and correct than web search results. These findings suggest that AI-driven solutions can cost-effectively bridge information gaps in low-connectivity regions."
2502.12447,"The rapid adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) is significantly reshaping human cognition, influencing how we engage with information, think, reason, and learn. This paper synthesizes existing literature on GenAI's effects on different aspects of human cognition. Drawing on Krathwohl's revised Bloom's Taxonomy and Dewey's conceptualization of reflective thought, we examine the mechanisms through which GenAI is affecting the development of different cognitive abilities. We focus on novices, such as students, who may lack both domain knowledge and an understanding of effective human-AI interaction. Accordingly, we provide implications for rethinking and designing educational experiences that foster critical thinking and deeper cognitive engagement."
2502.12515,"Mentoring software is a pivotal innovation in addressing critical challenges in teacher development within educational institutions. This study explores the transformative potential of digital mentoring platforms, evaluating their impact on enhancing traditional mentoring practices through scalable, data-driven, and accessible frameworks. The research synthesizes findings from existing literature to assess the effectiveness of key features, including structured goal setting, progress monitoring, and advanced analytics, in improving teacher satisfaction, retention, and professional growth. Using an integrative literature review approach, this study identifies both the advantages and barriers to implementing mentoring software in education. Financial constraints, limited institutional support, and data privacy concerns remain significant challenges, necessitating strategic interventions. Drawing insights from successful applications in healthcare and corporate sectors, the review highlights adaptive strategies such as leveraging open-source tools, cross-sector collaborations, and integrating mentoring software with existing professional development frameworks. The research emphasizes the necessity of integrating digital mentoring tools with institutional objectives to create enduring support systems for teacher development. Mentoring software not only enhances traditional mentorship but also facilitates broader professional networks that contribute to collective knowledge sharing."
2502.12552,"This paper analyzes the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactions with children below age of 18 years. Despite the transformative applications of LLMs in various aspects of children's lives such as education and therapy, there remains a significant gap in understanding and mitigating potential content harms specific to this demographic. The study acknowledges the diverse nature of children often overlooked by standard safety evaluations and proposes a comprehensive approach to evaluating LLM safety specifically for children. We list down potential risks that children may encounter when using LLM powered applications. Additionally we develop Child User Models that reflect the varied personalities and interests of children informed by literature in child care and psychology. These user models aim to bridge the existing gap in child safety literature across various fields. We utilize Child User Models to evaluate the safety of six state of the art LLMs. Our observations reveal significant safety gaps in LLMs particularly in categories harmful to children but not adults"
2502.12659,"The rapid development of large reasoning models, such as OpenAI-o3 and DeepSeek-R1, has led to significant improvements in complex reasoning over non-reasoning large language models~(LLMs). However, their enhanced capabilities, combined with the open-source access of models like DeepSeek-R1, raise serious safety concerns, particularly regarding their potential for misuse. In this work, we present a comprehensive safety assessment of these reasoning models, leveraging established safety benchmarks to evaluate their compliance with safety regulations. Furthermore, we investigate their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, such as jailbreaking and prompt injection, to assess their robustness in real-world applications. Through our multi-faceted analysis, we uncover four key findings: (1) There is a significant safety gap between the open-source R1 models and the o3-mini model, on both safety benchmark and attack, suggesting more safety effort on R1 is needed. (2) The distilled reasoning model shows poorer safety performance compared to its safety-aligned base models. (3) The stronger the model's reasoning ability, the greater the potential harm it may cause when answering unsafe questions. (4) The thinking process in R1 models pose greater safety concerns than their final answers. Our study provides insights into the security implications of reasoning models and highlights the need for further advancements in R1 models' safety to close the gap."
2502.12838,"The recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized industries such as finance, marketing, and customer service by enabling sophisticated natural language processing tasks. However, the broad adoption of LLMs brings significant challenges, particularly in the form of social biases that can be embedded within their outputs. Biases related to gender, age, and other sensitive attributes can lead to unfair treatment, raising ethical concerns and risking both company reputation and customer trust. This study examined bias in finance-related marketing slogans generated by LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT) by prompting tailored ads targeting five demographic categories: gender, marital status, age, income level, and education level. A total of 1,700 slogans were generated for 17 unique demographic groups, and key terms were categorized into four thematic groups: empowerment, financial, benefits and features, and personalization. Bias was systematically assessed using relative bias calculations and statistically tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test against general slogans generated for any individual. Results revealed that marketing slogans are not neutral; rather, they emphasize different themes based on demographic factors. Women, younger individuals, low-income earners, and those with lower education levels receive more distinct messaging compared to older, higher-income, and highly educated individuals. This underscores the need to consider demographic-based biases in AI-generated marketing strategies and their broader societal implications. The findings of this study provide a roadmap for developing more equitable AI systems, highlighting the need for ongoing bias detection and mitigation efforts in LLMs."
2502.12956,"The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the information environment, creating both opportunities and challenges. This paper explores how generative AI influences economic rent-seeking behavior and its broader impact on social welfare. We develop a dynamic economic model involving multiple agents who may engage in rent-seeking activities and a regulator aiming to mitigate social welfare losses. Our analysis reveals a dual effect of generative AI: while it reduces traditional information rents by increasing transparency, it also introduces new forms of rent-seeking, such as information manipulation and algorithmic interference. These behaviors can lead to decreased social welfare by exacerbating information asymmetries and misallocating resources. To address these challenges, we propose policy interventions, including taxation and regulatory measures. This study provides a new perspective on the economic implications of generative AI, offering valuable insights for policymakers and laying a foundation for future research on regulating AI-driven economic behaviors."
2502.12969,"Information asymmetry often leads to adverse selection and moral hazard in economic markets, causing inefficiencies and welfare losses. Traditional methods to address these issues, such as signaling and screening, are frequently insufficient. This research investigates how Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) can create detailed informational signals that help principals better understand agents' types and monitor their actions. By incorporating these AI-generated signals into a principal-agent model, the study aims to reduce inefficiencies and improve contract designs. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we demonstrate that Generative AI can effectively mitigate adverse selection and moral hazard, resulting in more efficient market outcomes and increased social welfare. Additionally, the findings offer practical insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders on the responsible implementation of Generative AI solutions to enhance market performance."
2502.13101,"This paper offers a conceptual analysis of the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in urban governance, focusing on how AI reshapes governance approaches, oversight mechanisms, and the relationship between bureaucratic discretion and accountability. Drawing on public administration theory, tech-driven governance practices, and data ethics, the study synthesizes insights to propose guiding principles for responsible AI integration in decision-making processes. While primarily conceptual, the paper draws on illustrative empirical cases to demonstrate how AI is reshaping discretion and accountability in real-world settings. The analysis argues that AI does not simply restrict or enhance discretion but redistributes it across institutional levels. It may simultaneously strengthen managerial oversight, enhance decision-making consistency, and improve operational efficiency. These changes affect different forms of accountability: political, professional, and participatory, while introducing new risks, such as data bias, algorithmic opacity, and fragmented responsibility across actors. In response, the paper proposes guiding principles: equitable AI access, adaptive administrative structures, robust data governance, and proactive human-led decision-making, citizen-engaged oversight. This study contributes to the AI governance literature by moving beyond narrow concerns with perceived discretion at the street level, highlighting instead how AI transforms rule-based discretion across governance systems. By bridging perspectives on efficiency and ethical risk, the paper presents a comprehensive framework for understanding the evolving relationship between discretion and accountability in AI-assisted governance."
2502.13254,"The recent democratization of personal fabrication has significantly advanced the maker movement and reshaped applied research in HCI and beyond. However, this growth has also raised increasing sustainability concerns, as material waste is an inevitable byproduct of making and rapid prototyping. In this work, we examine the sustainability landscape within the modern maker community, focusing on grassroots makerspaces and maker-oriented research labs through in-depth interviews with diverse stakeholders involved in making and managing making-related activities. Our findings highlight four key themes: the various types of ""waste"" generated through the making process, the strategies (or lack thereof) for managing this waste, the motivations driving (un)sustainable practices, and the challenges faced. We synthesize these insights into design considerations and takeaways for technical HCI researchers and the broader community, focusing on future tools, infrastructures, and educational approaches to foster sustainable making."
2502.13294,"The implementation of responsible AI in an organization is inherently complex due to the involvement of multiple stakeholders, each with their unique set of goals and responsibilities across the entire AI lifecycle. These responsibilities are often ambiguously defined and assigned, leading to confusion, miscommunication, and inefficiencies. Even when responsibilities are clearly defined and assigned to specific roles, the corresponding AI actors lack effective tools to support their execution.Toward closing these gaps, we present a systematic review and comprehensive meta-analysis of the current state of responsible AI tools, focusing on their alignment with specific stakeholder roles and their responsibilities in various AI lifecycle stages. We categorize over 220 tools according to AI actors and stages they address. Our findings reveal significant imbalances across the stakeholder roles and lifecycle stages addressed. The vast majority of available tools have been created to support AI designers and developers specifically during data-centric and statistical modeling stages while neglecting other roles such as institutional leadership, deployers, end-users, and impacted communities, and stages such as value proposition and deployment. The uneven distribution we describe here highlights critical gaps that currently exist in responsible AI governance research and practice. Our analysis reveals that despite the myriad of frameworks and tools for responsible AI, it remains unclear \emph{who} within an organization and \emph{when} in the AI lifecycle a tool applies. Furthermore, existing tools are rarely validated, leaving critical gaps in their usability and effectiveness. These gaps provide a starting point for researchers and practitioners to create more effective and holistic approaches to responsible AI development and governance."
2502.1402,"Education motivated the encouragement of female participation in several areas of science and technology. Programming marathons have grown over the years and are events where programmers compete to solve coding challenges. However, despite scientific evidence that there is no intellectual difference between genders, women's participation is relatively low. This work seeks to understand the reason for this adherence, considering the gender issue in Programming Marathons over the last years, in a real context. This work aims to understand the context of female representativeness in which the intellectual aspects do not differ in gender. Still, there is a considerable discrepancy in female belonging."
2502.14072,"This paper reports results of an investigation about the level of knowledge among undergraduate computer science students in Brazil regarding the topic of simulation. Amid rapid technological evolution, simulation emerges as a crucial resource for training professionals capable of facing complex challenges. The research seeks to analyze the presence and effectiveness of simulation education, exploring students' perceptions, the tools used, the challenges faced, and the prospects for deeper study. This report highlights the importance of academic training in a dynamic technological environment, emphasizing the crucial role of simulation education in undergraduate computer science, while exploring the foundations of the methodologies and educational strategies associated with the topic. A survey research approach is adopted. 108 answers were received from 10 Brazilian states. 19 respondents from 15 different institutions said they had some contact with simulation during their studies. Results reveal that MATLAB/Simulink is the most popular formalism/tool used to teach simulation in Brazil."
2502.1408,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies, such as cloud computing, machine learning, and AI, have improved productivity but introduced challenges in workforce training and reskilling. This is critical given existing workforce shortages, especially in marginalized communities like Underrepresented Minorities (URM), who often lack access to quality education. Addressing these challenges, this research presents gAI-PT4I4, a Generative AI-based Personalized Tutor for Industrial 4.0, designed to personalize 4IR experiential learning. gAI-PT4I4 employs sentiment analysis to assess student comprehension, leveraging generative AI and finite automaton to tailor learning experiences. The framework integrates low-fidelity Digital Twins for VR-based training, featuring an Interactive Tutor - a generative AI assistant providing real-time guidance via audio and text. It uses zero-shot sentiment analysis with LLMs and prompt engineering, achieving 86\% accuracy in classifying student-teacher interactions as positive or negative. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables personalized learning content grounded in domain-specific knowledge. To adapt training dynamically, finite automaton structures exercises into states of increasing difficulty, requiring 80\% task-performance accuracy for progression. Experimental evaluation with 22 volunteers showed improved accuracy exceeding 80\%, reducing training time. Finally, this paper introduces a Multi-Fidelity Digital Twin model, aligning Digital Twin complexity with Bloom's Taxonomy and Kirkpatrick's model, providing a scalable educational framework."
2502.14296,"Generative Foundation Models (GenFMs) have emerged as transformative tools. However, their widespread adoption raises critical concerns regarding trustworthiness across dimensions. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we systematically review global AI governance laws and policies from governments and regulatory bodies, as well as industry practices and standards. Based on this analysis, we propose a set of guiding principles for GenFMs, developed through extensive multidisciplinary collaboration that integrates technical, ethical, legal, and societal perspectives. Second, we introduce TrustGen, the first dynamic benchmarking platform designed to evaluate trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and model types, including text-to-image, large language, and vision-language models. TrustGen leverages modular components--metadata curation, test case generation, and contextual variation--to enable adaptive and iterative assessments, overcoming the limitations of static evaluation methods. Using TrustGen, we reveal significant progress in trustworthiness while identifying persistent challenges. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the challenges and future directions for trustworthy GenFMs, which reveals the complex, evolving nature of trustworthiness, highlighting the nuanced trade-offs between utility and trustworthiness, and consideration for various downstream applications, identifying persistent challenges and providing a strategic roadmap for future research. This work establishes a holistic framework for advancing trustworthiness in GenAI, paving the way for safer and more responsible integration of GenFMs into critical applications. To facilitate advancement in the community, we release the toolkit for dynamic evaluation."
2502.14592,"Education technologies (edtech) are increasingly incorporating new features built on large language models (LLMs), with the goals of enriching the processes of teaching and learning and ultimately improving learning outcomes. However, the potential downstream impacts of LLM-based edtech remain understudied. Prior attempts to map the risks of LLMs have not been tailored to education specifically, even though it is a unique domain in many respects: from its population (students are often children, who can be especially impacted by technology) to its goals (providing the correct answer may be less important for learners than understanding how to arrive at an answer) to its implications for higher-order skills that generalize across contexts (e.g., critical thinking and collaboration). We conducted semi-structured interviews with six edtech providers representing leaders in the K-12 space, as well as a diverse group of 23 educators with varying levels of experience with LLM-based edtech. Through a thematic analysis, we explored how each group is anticipating, observing, and accounting for potential harms from LLMs in education. We find that, while edtech providers focus primarily on mitigating technical harms, i.e., those that can be measured based solely on LLM outputs themselves, educators are more concerned about harms that result from the broader impacts of LLMs, i.e., those that require observation of interactions between students, educators, school systems, and edtech to measure. Overall, we (1) develop an education-specific overview of potential harms from LLMs, (2) highlight gaps between conceptions of harm by edtech providers and those by educators, and (3) make recommendations to facilitate the centering of educators in the design and development of edtech tools."
2502.14868,"The lack of explainability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the first obstacles that the industry and regulators must overcome to mitigate the risks associated with the technology. The need for eXplainable AI (XAI) is evident in fields where accountability, ethics and fairness are critical, such as healthcare, credit scoring, policing and the criminal justice system. At the EU level, the notion of explainability is one of the fundamental principles that underpin the AI Act, though the exact XAI techniques and requirements are still to be determined and tested in practice. This paper explores various approaches and techniques that promise to advance XAI, as well as the challenges of implementing the principle of explainability in AI governance and policies. Finally, the paper examines the integration of XAI into EU law, emphasising the issues of standard setting, oversight, and enforcement."
2502.14869,"The potential for negative impacts of AI has rapidly become more pervasive around the world, and this has intensified a need for responsible AI governance. While many regulatory bodies endorse risk-based approaches and a multitude of risk mitigation practices are proposed by companies and academic scholars, these approaches are commonly expert-centered and thus lack the inclusion of a significant group of stakeholders. Ensuring that AI policies align with democratic expectations requires methods that prioritize the voices and needs of those impacted. In this work we develop a participative and forward-looking approach to inform policy-makers and academics that grounds the needs of lay stakeholders at the forefront and enriches the development of risk mitigation strategies. Our approach (1) maps potential mitigation and prevention strategies of negative AI impacts that assign responsibility to various stakeholders, (2) explores the importance and prioritization thereof in the eyes of laypeople, and (3) presents these insights in policy fact sheets, i.e., a digestible format for informing policy processes. We emphasize that this approach is not targeted towards replacing policy-makers; rather our aim is to present an informative method that enriches mitigation strategies and enables a more participatory approach to policy development."
2502.1487,"The development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is likely to be one of humanity's most consequential technological advancements. Leading AI labs and scientists have called for the global prioritization of AI safety citing existential risks comparable to nuclear war. However, research on catastrophic risks and AI alignment is often met with skepticism, even by experts. Furthermore, online debate over the existential risk of AI has begun to turn tribal (e.g. name-calling such as ""doomer"" or ""accelerationist""). Until now, no systematic study has explored the patterns of belief and the levels of familiarity with AI safety concepts among experts. I surveyed 111 AI experts on their familiarity with AI safety concepts, key objections to AI safety, and reactions to safety arguments. My findings reveal that AI experts cluster into two viewpoints -- an ""AI as controllable tool"" and an ""AI as uncontrollable agent"" perspective -- diverging in beliefs toward the importance of AI safety. While most experts (78%) agreed or strongly agreed that ""technical AI researchers should be concerned about catastrophic risks"", many were unfamiliar with specific AI safety concepts. For example, only 21% of surveyed experts had heard of ""instrumental convergence,"" a fundamental concept in AI safety predicting that advanced AI systems will tend to pursue common sub-goals (such as self-preservation). The least concerned participants were the least familiar with concepts like this, suggesting that effective communication of AI safety should begin with establishing clear conceptual foundations in the field."
2502.15001,"Over 10,000 candidates wait for a kidney transplantation in Eurotransplant, and are prioritized for transplantation based on the allocation rules of the Eurotransplant Kidney Allocation System (ETKAS) and Eurotransplant Senior Program (ESP). These allocation rules have not changed much since ETKAS and ESP's introductions in 1996 and 1999, respectively, despite identification of several areas of improvement by the Eurotransplant Kidney Advisory Committee (ETKAC). A barrier to modernizing ETKAS and ESP kidney allocation rules is that Eurotransplant lacks tools to quantitatively assess the impact of policy changes. We present the ETKidney simulator, which was developed for this purpose. This tool simulates kidney allocation according to the actual ETKAS and ESP allocation rules, and implements Eurotransplant-specific allocation mechanisms such as the system which is used to balance the international exchange of kidneys. The ETKidney simulator was developed in close collaboration with medical doctors from Eurotransplant, and was presented to ETKAC and other major stakeholders. To enhance trust in the ETKidney simulator, the simulator is made publicly available with synthetic data, and is validated by comparing simulated to actual ETKAS and ESP outcomes between 2021 and 2024. We also illustrate how the simulator can contribute to kidney policy evaluation with three clinically motivated case studies. We anticipate that the ETKidney simulator will be pivotal in modernizing ETKAS and ESP allocation rules by enabling informed decision-making on kidney allocation rules together with national competent authorities."
2502.15357,"The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has introduced new opportunities for transforming higher education, particularly in fields that require analytical reasoning and regulatory compliance, such as cybersecurity management. This study presents a structured framework for integrating GenAI tools into cybersecurity education, demonstrating their role in fostering critical thinking, real-world problem-solving, and regulatory awareness. The implementation strategy followed a two-stage approach, embedding GenAI within tutorial exercises and assessment tasks. Tutorials enabled students to generate, critique, and refine AI-assisted cybersecurity policies, while assessments required them to apply AI-generated outputs to real-world scenarios, ensuring alignment with industry standards and regulatory requirements. Findings indicate that AI-assisted learning significantly enhanced students' ability to evaluate security policies, refine risk assessments, and bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application. Student reflections and instructor observations revealed improvements in analytical engagement, yet challenges emerged regarding AI over-reliance, variability in AI literacy, and the contextual limitations of AI-generated content. Through structured intervention and research-driven refinement, students were able to recognize AI strengths as a generative tool while acknowledging its need for human oversight. This study further highlights the broader implications of AI adoption in cybersecurity education, emphasizing the necessity of balancing automation with expert judgment to cultivate industry-ready professionals. Future research should explore the long-term impact of AI-driven learning on cybersecurity competency, as well as the potential for adaptive AI-assisted assessments to further personalize and enhance educational outcomes."
2502.15558,"In the context of Computing, competitive programming is a relevant area that aims to have students, usually in teams, solve programming challenges, developing skills and competencies in the field. However, female participation remains significantly low and notably distant compared to male participation, even with proven intellectual equity between genders. This research aims to present strategies used to improve female participation in Programming Marathons in Brasil. The developed research is documentary, applied, and exploratory, with actions that generate results for female participation, with affirmative and inclusion actions, an important step towards gender equity in competitive programming."
2502.15715,"Foundation models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) exacerbate a core regulatory challenge associated with AI: its heterogeneity. By their very nature, foundation models and generative AI can perform multiple functions for their users, thus presenting a vast array of different risks. This multifunctionality means that prescriptive, one-size-fits-all regulation will not be a viable option. Even performance standards and ex post liability - regulatory approaches that usually afford flexibility - are unlikely to be strong candidates for responding to multifunctional AI's risks, given challenges in monitoring and enforcement. Regulators will do well instead to promote proactive risk management on the part of developers and users by using management-based regulation, an approach that has proven effective in other contexts of heterogeneity. Regulators will also need to maintain ongoing vigilance and agility. More than in other contexts, regulators of multifunctional AI will need sufficient resources, top human talent and leadership, and organizational cultures committed to regulatory excellence."
2502.15719,"This year, jurisdictions worldwide, including the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and China, are set to enact or revise laws governing frontier AI. Their efforts largely rely on the assumption that increasing model scale through pretraining is the path to more advanced AI capabilities. Yet growing evidence suggests that this ""pretraining paradigm"" may be hitting a wall and major AI companies are turning to alternative approaches, like inference-time ""reasoning,"" to boost capabilities instead.This paradigm shift presents fundamental challenges for the frontier AI governance frameworks that target pretraining scale as a key bottleneck useful for monitoring, control, and exclusion, threatening to undermine this new legal order as it emerges. This essay seeks to identify these challenges and point to new paths forward for regulation. First, we examine the existing frontier AI regulatory regime and analyze some key traits and vulnerabilities. Second, we introduce the concept of the ""pretraining frontier,"" the capabilities threshold made possible by scaling up pretraining alone, and demonstrate how it could make the regulatory field more diffuse and complex and lead to new forms of competition. Third, we lay out a regulatory approach that focuses on increasing transparency and leveraging new natural technical bottlenecks to effectively oversee changing frontier AI development while minimizing regulatory burdens and protecting fundamental rights. Our analysis provides concrete mechanisms for governing frontier AI systems across diverse technical paradigms, offering policymakers tools for addressing both current and future regulatory challenges in frontier AI."
2502.1572,"Loyal AI is loyal to the community that builds it. An AI is loyal to a community if the community has ownership, alignment, and control. Community owned models can only be used with the approval of the community and share the economic rewards communally. Community aligned models have values that are aligned with the consensus of the community. Community controlled models perform functions designed by the community. Since we would like permissionless access to the loyal AI's community, we need the AI to be open source. The key scientific question then is: how can we build models that are openly accessible (open source) and yet are owned and governed by the community. This seeming impossibility is the focus of this paper where we outline a concrete pathway to Open, Monetizable and Loyal models (OML), building on our earlier work on OML,arXiv:2411.03887(1) , and a representation via a cryptographic-ML librarythis http URL."
2502.15858,"Training generative AI models requires extensive amounts of data. A common practice is to collect such data through web scraping. Yet, much of what has been and is collected is copyright protected. Its use may be copyright infringement. In the USA, AI developers rely on ""fair use"" and in Europe, the prevailing view is that the exception for ""Text and Data Mining"" (TDM) applies. In a recent interdisciplinary tandem-study, we have argued in detail that this is actually not the case because generative AI training fundamentally differs from TDM. In this article, we share our main findings and the implications for both public and corporate research on generative models. We further discuss how the phenomenon of training data memorization leads to copyright issues independently from the ""fair use"" and TDM exceptions. Finally, we outline how the ISMIR could contribute to the ongoing discussion about fair practices with respect to generative AI that satisfy all stakeholders."
2502.15859,"The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is profoundly transforming human society and concurrently presenting a series of ethical, legal, and social issues. The effective governance of AI has become a crucial global concern. Since 2022, the extensive deployment of generative AI, particularly large language models, marked a new phase in AI governance. Continuous efforts are being made by the international community in actively addressing the novel challenges posed by these AI developments. As consensus on international governance continues to be established and put into action, the practical importance of conducting a global assessment of the state of AI governance is progressively coming to light. In this context, we initiated the development of the AI Governance InternationaL Evaluation Index (AGILE Index). Adhering to the design principle, ""the level of governance should match the level of development,"" the inaugural evaluation of the AGILE Index commences with an exploration of four foundational pillars: the development level of AI, the AI governance environment, the AI governance instruments, and the AI governance effectiveness. It covers 39 indicators across 18 dimensions to comprehensively assess the AI governance level of 14 representative countries globally. The index is utilized to delve into the status of AI governance to date in 14 countries for the first batch of evaluation. The aim is to depict the current state of AI governance in these countries through data scoring, assist them in identifying their governance stage and uncovering governance issues, and ultimately offer insights for the enhancement of their AI governance systems."
2502.1587,"This study investigates how individuals' perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) limitations influence organizational readiness for AI adoption. Through semi-structured interviews with seven AI implementation experts, analyzed using the Gioia methodology, the research reveals that organizational readiness emerges through dynamic interactions between individual sensemaking, social learning, and formal integration processes. The findings demonstrate that hands-on experience with AI limitations leads to more realistic expectations and increased trust, mainly when supported by peer networks and champion systems. Organizations that successfully translate these individual and collective insights into formal governance structures achieve more sustainable AI adoption. The study advances theory by showing how organizational readiness for AI adoption evolves through continuous cycles of individual understanding, social learning, and organizational adaptation. These insights suggest that organizations should approach AI adoption not as a one-time implementation but as an ongoing strategic learning process that balances innovation with practical constraints. The research contributes to organizational readiness theory and practice by illuminating how micro-level perceptions and experiences shape macro-level adoption outcomes."
2502.15871,"The application of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare holds significant promise for enhancing clinical decision-making, medical research, and patient care. However, their integration into real-world clinical settings raises critical concerns around trustworthiness, particularly around dimensions of truthfulness, privacy, safety, robustness, fairness, and explainability. These dimensions are essential for ensuring that LLMs generate reliable, unbiased, and ethically sound outputs. While researchers have recently begun developing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks to assess LLM trustworthiness, the trustworthiness of LLMs in healthcare remains underexplored, lacking a systematic review that provides a comprehensive understanding and future insights. This survey addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive review of current methodologies and solutions aimed at mitigating risks across key trust dimensions. We analyze how each dimension affects the reliability and ethical deployment of healthcare LLMs, synthesize ongoing research efforts, and identify critical gaps in existing approaches. We also identify emerging challenges posed by evolving paradigms, such as multi-agent collaboration, multi-modal reasoning, and the development of small open-source medical models. Our goal is to guide future research toward more trustworthy, transparent, and clinically viable LLMs."
2502.15978,"Access to health information and services among women continues to be a major challenge in many communities globally. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the potential of chatbots to address this information and access gap. We conducted interviews and focus group discussions with underserved women in urban India to understand their receptivity towards the use of chatbots for maternal and child health, as well as barriers to their adoption. Our findings uncover gaps in digital access and literacies, and perceived conflict with various responsibilities that women are burdened with, which shape their interactions with digital technology. Our paper offers insights into the design of chatbots for community health that can meet the lived realities of women in underserved settings."
2502.16043,"The shift towards pluralism in global data ethics acknowledges the importance of including perspectives from the Global Majority to develop responsible data science practices that mitigate systemic harms in the current data science ecosystem. Sub-Saharan African (SSA) practitioners, in particular, are disseminating progressive data ethics principles and best practices for identifying and navigating anti-blackness and data colonialism. To center SSA voices in the global data ethics discourse, we present a framework for African data ethics informed by the thematic analysis of an interdisciplinary corpus of 50 documents. Our framework features six major principles: 1) Challenge Power Asymmetries, 2) Assert Data Self-Determination, 3) Invest in Local Data Institutions & Infrastructures, 4) Utilize Communalist Practices, 5) Center Communities on the Margins, and 6) Uphold Common Good. We compare our framework to seven particularist data ethics frameworks to find similar conceptual coverage but diverging interpretations of shared values. Finally, we discuss how African data ethics demonstrates the operational value of data ethics frameworks. Our framework highlights Sub-Saharan Africa as a pivotal site of responsible data science by promoting the practice of communalism, self-determination, and cultural preservation."
2502.1629,"The current discourse on large language models (LLMs) and copyright largely takes a ""behavioral"" perspective, focusing on model outputs and evaluating whether they are substantially similar to training data. However, substantial similarity is difficult to define algorithmically and a narrow focus on model outputs is insufficient to address all copyright risks. In this interdisciplinary work, we take a complementary ""structural"" perspective and shift our focus to how LLMs are trained. We operationalize a notion of ""fair learning"" by measuring whether any training decision substantially affected the model's memorization. As a case study, we deconstruct Pythia, an open-source LLM, and demonstrate the use of causal and correlational analyses to make factual determinations about Pythia's training decisions. By proposing a legal standard for fair learning and connecting memorization analyses to this standard, we identify how judges may advance the goals of copyright law through adjudication. Finally, we discuss how a fair learning standard might evolve to enhance its clarity by becoming more rule-like and incorporating external technical guidelines."
2502.16361,"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in public sector missions, necessitating robust evaluation of their safety and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This paper introduces a novel framework to quantify adversarial risks in VLMs. We analyze model performance under Gaussian, salt-and-pepper, and uniform noise, identifying misclassification thresholds and deriving composite noise patches and saliency patterns that highlight vulnerable regions. These patterns are compared against the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) to assess their adversarial effectiveness. We propose a new Vulnerability Score that combines the impact of random noise and adversarial attacks, providing a comprehensive metric for evaluating model robustness."
2502.16477,"In critical care settings, where precise and timely interventions are crucial for health outcomes, evaluating disparities in patient outcomes is essential. Current approaches often fail to fully capture the impact of respiratory support interventions on individuals affected by social determinants of health. While attributes such as gender, race, and age are commonly assessed and provide valuable insights, they offer only a partial view of the complexities faced by diverse populations. In this study, we focus on two clinically motivated tasks: prolonged mechanical ventilation and successful weaning. Additionally, we conduct fairness audits on the models' predictions across demographic groups and social determinants of health to better understand health inequities in respiratory interventions within the intensive care unit. Furthermore, we release a temporal benchmark dataset, verified by clinical experts, to facilitate benchmarking of clinical respiratory intervention tasks."
2502.16644,"This study maps the functions of artificial intelligence in disaster (mis)management. It begins with a classification of disasters in terms of their causal parameters, introducing hypothetical cases of independent or hybrid AI-caused disasters. We then overview the role of AI in disaster management and mismanagement, where the latter includes possible ethical repercussions of the use of AI in intelligent disaster management (IDM), as well as ways to prevent or mitigate these issues, which include pre-design a priori, in-design, and post-design methods as well as regulations. We then discuss the governments role in preventing the ethical repercussions of AI use in IDM and identify and asses its deficits and challenges. This discussion is followed by an account of the advantages and disadvantages of pre-design or embedded ethics. Finally, we briefly consider the question of accountability and liability in AI-caused disasters."
2502.16701,"Generative AI release decisions determine whether system components are made available, but release does not address many other elements that change how users and stakeholders are able to engage with a system. Beyond release, access to system components informs potential risks and benefits. Access refers to practical needs, infrastructurally, technically, and societally, in order to use available components in some way. We deconstruct access along three axes: resourcing, technical usability, and utility. Within each category, a set of variables per system component clarify tradeoffs. For example, resourcing requires access to computing infrastructure to serve model weights. We also compare the accessibility of four high performance language models, two open-weight and two closed-weight, showing similar considerations for all based instead on access variables. Access variables set the foundation for being able to scale or increase access to users; we examine the scale of access and how scale affects ability to manage and intervene on risks. This framework better encompasses the landscape and risk-benefit tradeoffs of system releases to inform system release decisions, research, and policy."
2502.16732,"The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare is transforming clinical decision-making and hospital operations. DeepSeek has emerged as a leading AI system, widely deployed across China's tertiary hospitals since January 2025. Initially implemented in Shanghai's major medical institutions, it has since expanded nationwide, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, streamlining workflows, and improving patient management. AI-powered pathology, imaging analysis, and clinical decision support systems have demonstrated significant potential in optimizing medical processes and reducing the cognitive burden on healthcare professionals. However, the widespread adoption of AI in healthcare raises critical regulatory and ethical challenges, particularly regarding accountability in AI-assisted diagnosis and the risk of automation bias. The absence of a well-defined liability framework underscores the need for policies that ensure AI functions as an assistive tool rather than an autonomous decision-maker. With continued technological advancements, AI is expected to integrate multimodal data sources, such as genomics and radiomics, paving the way for precision medicine and personalized treatment strategies. The future of AI in healthcare depends on the development of transparent regulatory structures, industry collaboration, and adaptive governance frameworks that balance innovation with responsibility, ensuring equitable and effective AI-driven medical services."
2502.16739,"Educational technologies are revolutionizing how educational institutions operate. Consequently, it makes them a lucrative target for breach and abuse as they often serve as centralized hubs for diverse types of sensitive data, from academic records to health information. Existing studies looked into how existing stakeholders perceive the security and privacy risks of educational technologies and how those risks are affecting institutional policies for acquiring new technologies. However, outside of institutional vetting and approval, there is a pervasive practice of using applications and devices acquired personally. It is unclear how these applications and devices affect the dynamics of the overall institutional ecosystem.This study aims to address this gap by understanding why instructors use unsanctioned applications, how instructors perceive the associated risks, and how it affects institutional security and privacy postures. We designed and conducted an online survey-based study targeting instructors and administrators from K-12 and higher education institutions."
2502.16755,"E-scooters are becoming a popular means of urban transportation. However, this increased popularity brings challenges, such as road accidents and conflicts when sharing space with traditional transport modes. An in-depth understanding of e-scooter rider behaviour is crucial for ensuring rider safety, guiding infrastructure planning, and enforcing traffic rules. This study investigated the rider behaviour through a naturalistic study with 23 participants equipped with a bike computer, eye-tracking glasses and cameras. They followed a pre-determined route, enabling multi-modal data collection. We analysed and compared gaze movements, speed, and video feeds across three transport infrastructure types: a pedestrian-shared path, a cycle lane and a roadway. Our findings reveal unique challenges e-scooter riders face, including difficulty keeping up with cyclists and motor vehicles due to speed limits on shared e-scooters, risks in signalling turns due to control lose, and limited acceptance in mixed-use spaces. The cycle lane showed the highest average speed, the least speed change points, and the least head movements, supporting its suitability as dedicated infrastructure for e-scooters. These findings are facilitated through multimodal sensing and analysing the e-scooter riders' ego-centric view, which show the efficacy of our method in discovering the behavioural dynamics of the riders in the wild. Our study highlights the critical need to align infrastructure with user behaviour to improve safety and emphasises the importance of targeted safety measures and regulations, especially when e-scooter riders share spaces with pedestrians or motor vehicles. The dataset and analysis code are available atthis https URL."
2502.17638,"Legal services rely heavily on text processing. While large language models (LLMs) show promise, their application in legal contexts demands higher accuracy, repeatability, and transparency. Logic programs, by encoding legal concepts as structured rules and facts, offer reliable automation, but require sophisticated text extraction. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that integrates LLMs' natural language understanding with logic-based reasoning to address these limitations.As a legal document case study, we applied neuro-symbolic AI to coverage-related queries in insurance contracts using both closed and open-source LLMs. While LLMs have improved in legal reasoning, they still lack the accuracy and consistency required for complex contract analysis. In our analysis, we tested three methodologies to evaluate whether a specific claim is covered under a contract: a vanilla LLM, an unguided approach that leverages LLMs to encode both the contract and the claim, and a guided approach that uses a framework for the LLM to encode the contract. We demonstrated the promising capabilities of LLM + Logic in the guided approach."
2502.17639,"Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Survival largely depends on tumor stage at diagnosis, and early detection with low-dose CT can significantly reduce mortality in high-risk patients. AI can improve the detection, measurement, and characterization of pulmonary nodules while reducing assessment time. However, the training data, functionality, and performance of available AI systems vary considerably, complicating software selection and regulatory evaluation. Manufacturers must specify intended use and provide test statistics, but they can choose their training and test data, limiting standardization and comparability. Under the EU AI Act, consistent quality assurance is required for AI-based nodule detection, measurement, and characterization.This position paper proposes systematic quality assurance grounded in a validated reference dataset, including real screening cases plus phantom data to verify volume and growth rate measurements. Regular updates shall reflect demographic shifts and technological advances, ensuring ongoing relevance. Consequently, ongoing AI quality assurance is vital. Regulatory challenges are also adressed. While the MDR and the EU AI Act set baseline requirements, they do not adequately address self-learning algorithms or their updates. A standardized, transparent quality assessment - based on sensitivity, specificity, and volumetric accuracy - enables an objective evaluation of each AI solution's strengths and weaknesses. Establishing clear testing criteria and systematically using updated reference data lay the groundwork for comparable performance metrics, informing tenders, guidelines, and recommendations."
2502.1773,"As AI becomes more embedded in workplaces, it is shifting from a tool for efficiency to an active force in organizational decision-making. Whether due to anthropomorphism or intentional design choices, people often assign human-like qualities, including gender, to AI systems. However, how AI managers are perceived in comparison to human managers and how gender influences these perceptions remains uncertain. To investigate this, we conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) where teams of three participants worked together under a randomly assigned manager. The manager was either a human or an AI and was presented as male, female, or gender-unspecified. The manager's role was to select the best-performing team member for an additional award. Our findings reveal that while participants initially showed no strong preference based on manager type or gender, their perceptions changed significantly after experiencing the award process. As expected, those who received awards rated their managers as more trustworthy, competent, fair, and were more willing to work with similar managers in the future, while those who were not selected viewed them less favorably. However, male managers, whether human or AI, were more positively received by awarded participants, whereas female managers, especially female AI managers, faced greater skepticism and negative judgments when they did not give awards. These results suggest that gender bias in leadership extends beyond human managers to include AI-driven decision-makers. As AI assumes more managerial responsibilities, understanding and addressing these biases will be crucial for designing fair and effective AI management systems."
2502.17816,"Disparities in lending to minority applicants persist even as algorithmic lending practices proliferate. Further, disparities in interest rates charged can remain large even when loan applicants from different groups are equally creditworthy. We study the role of risk-management constraints, specifically Value-at-Risk (VaR) constraints, in the persistence of segregation in loan approval decisions. We develop a formal model in which a mainstream (low-interest) bank is more sensitive to variance risk than a subprime (high-interest) bank. If the mainstream bank has an inflated prior belief about the variance of the minority group, it may deny that group credit indefinitely, thus never learning the true risk of lending to that group, while the subprime lender serves this population at higher rates. We formalize this as a ""subprime trap"" equilibrium. Finally, we show that a small, finite subsidy (or partial guarantee) can help minority groups escape the trap by covering enough of the mainstream bank's downside so that it can afford to lend and learn the minority group's true risk. Once it has sufficiently many data points, it meets its VaR requirement with no further assistance, minority groups are approved for loans by the mainstream bank, and competition drives down the interest rates of subprime lenders."
2502.17877,"This paper first introduces China's legal framework regulating facial recognition technology (FRT) and analyzes the underlying problems. Although current laws and regulations have restricted the development of FRT under some circumstances, these restrictions may function poorly when the technology is installed by the government or when it is deployed for the purpose of protecting public security. We use two cases to illustrate this asymmetric regulatory model, which can be traced to systematic preferences that existed prior to recent legislative efforts advancing personal data protection. Based on these case studies and evaluation of relevant regulations, this paper explains why China has developed this distinctive asymmetric regulatory model towards FRT specifically and personally data generally."
2502.18066,"Advances in deepfake technologies, which use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to mimic a person's likeness or voice, have led to growing interest in their use in educational contexts. However, little is known about how key stakeholders perceive and intend to use these tools. This study investigated higher education stakeholder perceptions and intentions regarding deepfakes through the lens of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2).Using a mixed-methods approach combining survey data (n=174) with qualitative interviews, we found that academic stakeholders demonstrated a relatively low intention to adopt these technologies (M=41.55, SD=34.14) and held complex views about their implementation. Quantitative analysis revealed adoption intentions were primarily driven by hedonic motivation, with a gender-specific interaction in price-value evaluations. Qualitative findings highlighted potential benefits of enhanced student engagement, improved accessibility, and reduced workload in content creation, but concerns regarding the exploitation of academic labour, institutional cost-cutting leading to automation, degradation of relationships in education, and broader societal impacts.Based on these findings, we propose a framework for implementing deepfake technologies in higher education that addresses institutional policies, professional development, and equitable resource allocation to thoughtfully integrate AI while maintaining academic integrity and professional autonomy."
2502.1821,"Simulation powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a promising method for exploring complex human social behaviors. However, the application of LLMs in simulations presents significant challenges, particularly regarding their capacity to accurately replicate the complexities of human behaviors and societal dynamics, as evidenced by recent studies highlighting discrepancies between simulated and real-world interactions. We rethink LLM-based simulations by emphasizing both their limitations and the necessities for advancing LLM simulations. By critically examining these challenges, we aim to offer actionable insights and strategies for enhancing the applicability of LLM simulations in human society in the future."
2502.18359,"Thanks to advances in large language models, a new type of software agent, the artificial intelligence (AI) agent, has entered the marketplace. Companies such as OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Salesforce promise their AI Agents will go from generating passive text to executing tasks. Instead of a travel itinerary, an AI Agent would book all aspects of your trip. Instead of generating text or images for social media post, an AI Agent would post the content across a host of social media outlets. The potential power of AI Agents has fueled legal scholars' fears that AI Agents will enable rogue commerce, human manipulation, rampant defamation, and intellectual property harms. These scholars are calling for regulation before AI Agents cause havoc.This Article addresses the concerns around AI Agents head on. It shows that core aspects of how one piece of software interacts with another creates ways to discipline AI Agents so that rogue, undesired actions are unlikely, perhaps more so than rules designed to govern human agents. It also develops a way to leverage the computer-science approach to value-alignment to improve a user's ability to take action to prevent or correct AI Agent operations. That approach offers and added benefit of helping AI Agents align with norms around user-AI Agent interactions. These practices will enable desired economic outcomes and mitigate perceived risks. The Article also argues that no matter how much AI Agents seem like human agents, they need not, and should not, be given legal personhood status. In short, humans are responsible for AI Agents' actions, and this Article provides a guide for how humans can build and maintain responsible AI Agents."
2502.18456,"With a global shortage of cybersecurity students with the education and experience necessary to fill more than 3 million jobs, cybersecurity education is an international problem. Significant research within this field has explored this problem in depth, identifying a variety of shortcomings in the cybersecurity educational pipeline including lack of certifications, security clearances, and appropriate educational opportunities within institutions of higher education. Additional research has built on this, exploring specific gaps within what cybersecurity opportunities are provided within institutions of higher education. We build an ordinal scale for assessing this, the cybersecurity education maturity model scale (CEMMs), and provide evidence of reliability and validity. We then calculate the CEMMs score for all public four-year universities in the state of Virginia between 2017 and 2025, with 2017 marking a year in which the state started the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI). We find that the scale proposed provides a consistent and reliable way to compare the cybersecurity offerings available between universities. When comparing year to year average CEMMs score, we find that public four year universities in Virginia are increasing their program offerings in the area of cybersecurity, with potential to make an impact on the cybersecurity jobs gap."
2502.18542,"An emerging phenomenon, digital legacy management explores the management of digital data individuals accumulate throughout their lifetime. With the integration of digital systems and data into people's daily lives, it becomes crucial to understand the intricacies of managing data to eventually form one's digital legacy. This can be understood by investigating the significance of behavioral predictors in shaping digital legacy management.The objective of this study is to explore how behavioral predictors influence the intentions of individuals in South Africa towards managing their digital legacy. This entailed:Investigating the impact of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control on these intentions. Exploring the perceived usefulness of digital legacy management systems. Understanding the implications of response cost and task-technology fit on individuals' inclinations towards digital legacy planning. Data were collected (n = 203 valid responses) from South African residents using an online survey and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation analysis (PLS-SEM). Results indicate that attitudes, peer opinions, personal resources, and skills are significant positive influences on digital legacy management intention. Recognizing and understanding these behavioral predictors is key when developing region-specific and culturally sensitive digital legacy management tools, awareness campaigns, and policies. Furthermore, it could pave the way for more tailored strategies, ensuring effective transfer of post-mortem data, reducing potential conflicts, and providing clarity when dealing with post-mortem data."
2502.18695,"Content moderation plays a critical role in shaping safe and inclusive online environments, balancing platform standards, user expectations, and regulatory frameworks. Traditionally, this process involves operationalising policies into guidelines, which are then used by downstream human moderators for enforcement, or to further annotate datasets for training machine learning moderation models. However, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) are transforming this landscape. These models can now interpret policies directly as textual inputs, eliminating the need for extensive data curation. This approach offers unprecedented flexibility, as moderation can be dynamically adjusted through natural language interactions. This paradigm shift raises important questions about how policies are operationalised and the implications for content moderation practices. In this paper, we formalise the emerging policy-as-prompt framework and identify five key challenges across four domains: Technical Implementation (1. translating policy to prompts, 2. sensitivity to prompt structure and formatting), Sociotechnical (3. the risk of technological determinism in policy formation), Organisational (4. evolving roles between policy and machine learning teams), and Governance (5. model governance and accountability). Through analysing these challenges across technical, sociotechnical, organisational, and governance dimensions, we discuss potential mitigation approaches. This research provides actionable insights for practitioners and lays the groundwork for future exploration of scalable and adaptive content moderation systems in digital ecosystems."
2502.18774,"What do pickles and trampolines have in common? In this paper we show that while purchases for these products may seem innocuous, they risk revealing clues about customers' personal attributes - in this case, their race.As online retail and digital purchases become increasingly common, consumer data has become increasingly valuable, raising the risks of privacy violations and online discrimination. This work provides the first open analysis measuring these risks, using purchase histories crowdsourced from (N=4248) USthis http URLcustomers and survey data on their personal attributes. With this limited sample and simple models, we demonstrate how easily consumers' personal attributes, such as health and lifestyle information, gender, age, and race, can be inferred from purchases. For example, our models achieve AUC values over 0.9 for predicting gender and over 0.8 for predicting diabetes status. To better understand the risks that highly resourced firms like Amazon, data brokers, and advertisers present to consumers, we measure how our models' predictive power scales with more data. Finally, we measure and highlight how different product categories contribute to inference risk in order to make our findings more interpretable and actionable for future researchers and privacy advocates."
2502.19107,"Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) has entered the mainstream culture and become a subject of extensive academic investigation. However, the character and background of its impact on art require subtler scrutiny and more nuanced contextualization. This paper summarizes a broader study of the roles that AI's conceptual and ideological substrata play in influencing art notions. The focus is on divergent but coalescing and often questionable ideas, values, and political views that generative AI and other art-related AI technologies propagate from the computer science and AI/tech industry to the contemporary art and culture. The paper maps the main areas of this complex relationship and concisely critiques their key aspects."
2502.1919,"This paper presents a set of provocations for considering the uses, impact, and harms of generative AI from the perspective of humanities researchers. We provide a working definition of humanities research, summarize some of its most salient theories and methods, and apply these theories and methods to the current landscape of AI. Drawing from foundational work in critical data studies, along with relevant humanities scholarship, we elaborate eight claims with broad applicability to current conversations about generative AI: 1) Models make words, but people make meaning; 2) Generative AI requires an expanded definition of culture; 3) Generative AI can never be representative; 4) Bigger models are not always better models; 5) Not all training data is equivalent; 6) Openness is not an easy fix; 7) Limited access to compute enables corporate capture; and 8) AI universalism creates narrow human subjects. We conclude with a discussion of the importance of resisting the extraction of humanities research by computer science and related fields."
2502.19422,"This paper focuses on the piloting of CyberScholar, a Generative AI assistant tool that aims to provide formative feedback on writing in K-12 contexts. Specifically, this study explores how students worked with CyberScholar in diverse subject areas, including English Language Arts, Social Studies, and Modern World History classes in Grades 7, 8, 10, and 11 in three schools in the Midwest and one in the Northwest of the United States. This paper focuses on CyberScholar's potential to support K-12 students' writing in diverse subject areas requiring written assignments. Data were collected through implementation observations, surveys, and interviews by participating 121 students and 4 teachers. Thematic qualitative analysis revealed that the feedback tool was perceived as a valuable tool for supporting student writing through detailed feedback, enhanced interactivity, and alignment with rubric criteria. Students appreciated the tool's guidance in refining their writing. For the students, the assistant tool suggests restructuring feedback as a dynamic, dialogic process rather than a static evaluation, a shift that aligns with the cyber-social learning idea, self-regulation, and metacognition. For the teaching side, the findings indicate a shift in teachers' roles, from serving primarily as evaluators to guiding AI feedback processes that foster better student writing and critical thinking."
2502.19423,"The explorations and applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various domains becomes increasingly vital as it continues to evolve. While much attention has been focused on Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, this research examines the readiness of other LLMs such as Google Gemini (previously Google BARD), a conversational AI chatbot, for potential business applications. Gemini is an example of a Generative AI (Gen AI) that demonstrates capabilities encompassing content generation, language translation, and information retrieval. This study aims to assess its efficacy for text simplification in catering to the demands of modern businesses. A dataset of 42,654 reviews from distinct Disneyland branches was employed. The chatbot's API was utilised with a uniform prompt to generate simplified re-views. Results presented a spectrum of responses, including 75% successful simplifications, 25% errors, and instances of model self-reference. Quantitative analysis encompassing response categorisation, error prevalence, and response length distribution was conducted. Furthermore, Natural Language Processing (NLP) metrics were applied to gauge the quality of the generated content with the original reviews. The findings offer insights into Gen AI models performance, highlighting proficiency in simplifying re-views while unveiling certain limitations in coherence and consistency since only about 7.79% of the datasets was simplified. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on AI adoption in business contexts. The study's out-comes provide implications for future development and implementation of AI-driven tools in businesses seeking to enhance content creation and communication processes. As AI continues to transform industries, an understanding of the readiness and limitations of AI models is essential for informed decision-making, automations and effective integration."
2502.19424,"Problem. Educational disparities in Mathematics performance are a persistent challenge. This study aims to unravel the complex factors contributing to these disparities among students internationally, with a focus on the interpretability of the contributing factors. Methodology. Utilizing data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), we conducted rigorous preprocessing and variable selection to prepare for applying binary classification interpretability models. These models were trained using the Stratified K-Fold technique to ensure balanced representation and assessed using six key metrics. Solution. By applying interpretability models such as Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis, we identified critical factors impacting student performance, including reading accessibility, critical thinking skills, gender, and geographical location. Results. Our findings reveal significant disparities linked to resource availability, with students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds possessing fewer books and demonstrating lower performance in Mathematics. The geographical analysis highlighted regional educational disparities, with certain areas consistently underperforming in PISA assessments. Gender also emerged as a determinant, with females contributing differently to performance levels across the spectrum. Conclusion. The study provides insights into the multifaceted determinants of student Mathematics performance and suggests potential avenues for future research to explore global interpretability models and further investigate the socioeconomic, cultural, and educational factors at play."
2502.19463,"This research describes a novel approach to evaluating hedging behaviour in large language models (LLMs), specifically in the context of human rights as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Hedging and non-affirmation are behaviours that express ambiguity or a lack of clear endorsement on specific statements. These behaviours are undesirable in certain contexts, such as queries about whether different groups are entitled to specific human rights; since all people are entitled to human rights. Here, we present the first systematic attempt to measure these behaviours in the context of human rights, with a particular focus on between-group comparisons. To this end, we design a novel prompt set on human rights in the context of different national or social identities. We develop metrics to capture hedging and non-affirmation behaviours and then measure whether LLMs exhibit demographic parity when responding to the queries. We present results on three leading LLMs and find that all models exhibit some demographic disparities in how they attribute human rights between different identity groups. Futhermore, there is high correlation between different models in terms of how disparity is distributed amongst identities, with identities that have high disparity in one model also facing high disparity in both the other models. While baseline rates of hedging and non-affirmation differ, these disparities are consistent across queries that vary in ambiguity and they are robust across variations of the precise query wording. Our findings highlight the need for work to explicitly align LLMs to human rights principles, and to ensure that LLMs endorse the human rights of all groups equally."
2502.19719,"Internet and digital technologies have facilitated copyright sharing in an unprecedented way, creating significant tensions between the free flow of information and the exclusive nature of intellectual property. Copyright owners, users, and online platforms are the three major players in the copyright system. These stakeholders and their relations form the main structure of the copyright-sharing economy. Using China as an example, this paper provides a tripartite perspective on the copyright ecology based on three categories of sharing, namely unauthorized sharing, altruistic sharing, and freemium sharing. The line between copyright owners, users, and platforms has been blurred by rapidly changing technologies and market forces. By examining the strategies and practices of these parties, this paper illustrate the opportunities and challenges for China's copyright industry and digital economy. The paper concludes that under the shadow of the law, a sustainable copyright-sharing model must carefully align the interests of businesses and individual users."
2502.19771,"Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) is increasingly integrated into people's daily lives. While it is known that AI perpetuates biases against marginalized human groups, their impact on non-human animals remains understudied. We found that ChatGPT's text-to-image model (DALL-E 3) introduces a strong bias toward romanticizing livestock farming as dairy cows on pasture and pigs rooting in mud. This bias remained when we requested realistic depictions and was only mitigated when the automatic prompt revision was inhibited. Most farmed animal in industrialized countries are reared indoors with limited space per animal, which fail to resonate with societal values. Inhibiting prompt revision resulted in images that more closely reflected modern farming practices; for example, cows housed indoors accessing feed through metal headlocks, and pigs behind metal railings on concrete floors in indoor facilities. While OpenAI introduced prompt revision to mitigate bias, in the case of farmed animal production systems, it paradoxically introduces a strong bias towards unrealistic farming practices."
2502.20021,"Environmental sustainability in Systems-of-Systems (SoS) is an emerging field that seeks to integrate technological solutions to promote the efficient management of natural resources. While systematic reviews address sustainability in the context of Smart Cities (a category of SoS), a systematic study synthesizing the existing knowledge on environmental sustainability applied to SoS in general does not exist. Although literature includes other types of sustainability, such as financial and social, this study focuses on environmental sustainability, analyzing how SoS contribute to sustainable practices such as carbon emission reduction, energy efficiency, and biodiversity conservation. We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study to identify the application domains of SoS in sustainability, the challenges faced, and research opportunities. We planned and executed a research protocol including an automated search over four scientific databases. Of 926 studies retrieved, we selected, analyzed, and reported the results of 39 relevant studies. Our findings reveal that most studies focus on Smart Cities and Smart Grids, while applications such as sustainable agriculture and wildfire prevention are less explored. We identified challenges such as system interoperability, scalability, and data governance. Finally, we propose future research directions for SoS and environmental sustainability."
2502.20242,"Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) is an emerging paradigm that enables collaborative model training without centralized data and model aggregation, enhancing privacy and resilience. However, its sustainability remains underexplored, as energy consumption and carbon emissions vary across different system configurations. Understanding the environmental impact of DFL is crucial for optimizing its design and deployment. This work aims to develop a comprehensive and operational framework for assessing the sustainability of DFL systems. To address it, this work provides a systematic method for quantifying energy consumption and carbon emissions, offering insights into improving the sustainability of DFL. This work proposes GreenDFL, a fully implementable framework that has been integrated into a real-world DFL platform. GreenDFL systematically analyzes the impact of various factors, including hardware accelerators, model architecture, communication medium, data distribution, network topology, and federation size, on the sustainability of DFL systems. Besides, a sustainability-aware aggregation algorithm (GreenDFL-SA) and a node selection algorithm (GreenDFL-SN) are developed to optimize energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in DFL training. Empirical experiments are conducted on multiple datasets, measuring energy consumption and carbon emissions at different phases of the DFL lifecycle. The proposed GreenDFL provides a comprehensive and practical approach for assessing the sustainability of DFL systems. Furthermore, it offers best practices for improving environmental efficiency in DFL, making sustainability considerations more actionable in real-world deployments."
2502.20459,"Text-to-image generative AI systems exhibit significant limitations when engaging with under-represented domains, including non-Western art forms, often perpetuating biases and misrepresentations. We present a focused case study on the generative AI system DALL-E 3, examining its inability to properly represent calligraphic Arabic script, a culturally significant art form. Through a critical analysis of the generated outputs, we explore these limitations, emerging biases, and the broader implications in light of Edward Said's concept of Orientalism as well as historical examples of pseudo-Arabic. We discuss how misrepresentations persist in new technological contexts and what consequences they may have."
2502.21114,"Soft and future skills are in high demand in the modern job market. These skills are required for both technical and non-technical people. It is difficult to teach these competencies in a classical academic environment.The paper presents a possible approach to teaching in soft and future skills in a short, intensive joint project. In our case, it is a project within the Erasmus+ framework, but it can be organized in many different frameworks.In the project we use problem based learning, active learning and group-work teaching methodologies. Moreover, the approach put high emphasizes diversity. We arrange a set of multidisciplinary students in groups. Each group is working on software development tasks. This type of projects demand diversity, and only a part of the team needs technical skills. In our case less than half of participants had computer science background. Additionally, software development projects are usually interesting for non-technical students.The multicultural, multidisciplinary and international aspects are very important in a modern global working environment. On the other hand, short time of the project and its intensity allow to simulate stressful situations in a real word tasks. The effects of the project on the required competencies are measured using the KYSS method.The results prove that the presented method increased participants soft skills in communication, cooperation, digital skills and self reflection."
2502.21248,"The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of pre-mortem digital twins, AI-driven replicas that mimic the behavior, personality, and knowledge of living individuals. These digital doppelgangers serve various functions, including enhancing productivity, enabling creative collaboration, and preserving personal legacies. However, their development raises critical ethical, legal, and societal concerns. Issues such as identity fragmentation, psychological effects on individuals and their social circles, and the risks of unauthorized cloning and data exploitation demand careful examination. Additionally, as these AI clones evolve into more autonomous entities, concerns about consent, ownership, and accountability become increasingly complex.This paper differentiates pre-mortem AI clones from post-mortem generative ghosts, examining their unique ethical and legal implications. We explore key challenges, including the erosion of personal identity, the implications of AI agency, and the regulatory gaps in digital rights and privacy laws. Through a research-driven approach, we propose a framework for responsible AI governance, emphasizing identity preservation, consent mechanisms, and autonomy safeguards. By aligning technological advancements with societal values, this study contributes to the growing discourse on AI ethics and provides policy recommendations for the ethical deployment of pre-mortem AI clones."
2503.00069,"Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on producing responses that meet human expectations and align with shared values - a process coined alignment. However, aligning LLMs remains challenging due to the inherent disconnect between the complexity of human values and the narrow nature of the technological approaches designed to address them. Current alignment methods often lead to misspecified objectives, reflecting the broader issue of incomplete contracts, the impracticality of specifying a contract between a model developer, and the model that accounts for every scenario in LLM alignment. In this paper, we argue that improving LLM alignment requires incorporating insights from societal alignment frameworks, including social, economic, and contractual alignment, and discuss potential solutions drawn from these domains. Given the role of uncertainty within societal alignment frameworks, we then investigate how it manifests in LLM alignment. We end our discussion by offering an alternative view on LLM alignment, framing the underspecified nature of its objectives as an opportunity rather than perfect their specification. Beyond technical improvements in LLM alignment, we discuss the need for participatory alignment interface designs."
2503.00072,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are emerging as a popular alternative to traditional education, offering learners the flexibility to access a wide range of courses from various disciplines, anytime and anywhere. Despite this accessibility, a significant number of enrollments in MOOCs result in dropouts. To enhance learner engagement, it is crucial to recommend courses that align with their preferences and needs. Course Recommender Systems (RSs) can play an important role in this by modeling learners' preferences based on their previous interactions within the MOOC platform. Time-to-dropout and time-to-completion in MOOCs, like other time-to-event prediction tasks, can be effectively modeled using survival analysis (SA) methods. In this study, we apply SA methods to improve collaborative filtering recommendation performance by considering time-to-event in the context of MOOCs. Our proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to collaborative filtering methods trained based on learners' interactions with MOOCs, as evidenced by two performance measures on three publicly available datasets. The findings underscore the potential of integrating SA methods with RSs to enhance personalization in MOOCs."
2503.00076,"The Digital Twin (DT) offers a novel approach to the management of critical infrastructures, including energy, water, traffic, public health, and communication systems, which are indispensable for the functioning of modern societies. The increasing complexity and interconnectedness of these infrastructures necessitate the development of robust disaster response and management strategies. During crises and disasters, data source availability for critical infrastructure may be severely constrained due to physical damage to communication networks, power outages, overwhelmed systems, sensor failure or intentional disruptions, hampering the ability to effectively monitor, manage, and respond to emergencies. This research introduces a taxonomy and similarity function for comparing data sources based on their features and vulnerability to crisis events. This assessment enables the identification of similar, complementary, and alternative data sources and rapid adaptation when primary sources fail. The paper outlines a data source manager as an additional component for existing DT frameworks, specifically the data ingress and scenario mangement. A case study for traffic data sources in an urban scenario demonstrates the proposed methodology and its effectiveness. This approach enhances the robustness and adaptability of DTs in disaster management applications, contributing to improved decision-making and response capabilities in critical situations."
2503.00079,"Even though AI literacy has emerged as a prominent education topic in the wake of generative AI, its definition remains vague. There is little consensus among researchers and practitioners on how to discuss and design AI literacy interventions. The term has been used to describe both learning activities that train undergraduate students to use ChatGPT effectively and having kindergarten children interact with social robots. This paper applies an integrative review method to examine empirical and theoretical AI literacy studies published since 2020. In synthesizing the 124 reviewed studies, three ways to conceptualize literacy-functional, critical, and indirectly beneficial-and three perspectives on AI-technical detail, tool, and sociocultural-were identified, forming a framework that reflects the spectrum of how AI literacy is approached in practice. The framework highlights the need for more specialized terms within AI literacy discourse and indicates research gaps in certain AI literacy objectives."
2503.00081,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has the potential to transform higher education by generating human-like content. The advancement in GenAI has revolutionised several aspects of education, especially subject and assessment design. In this era, it is crucial to design assessments that challenge students and cannot be solved using GenAI tools. This makes it necessary to update the educational content with rapidly evolving technology. The assessment plays a significant role in ensuring the students learning, as it encourages students to engage actively, leading to the achievement of learning outcomes. The paper intends to determine how effectively GenAI can design a subject, including lectures, labs and assessments, using prompts and custom-based training. This paper aims to elucidate the direction to educators so they can leverage GenAI to create subject content. Additionally, we provided our experiential learning for educators to develop content, highlighting the importance of prompts and fine-tuning to ensure output quality. It has also been observed that expert evaluation is essential for assessing the quality of GenAI-generated materials throughout the content generation process."
2503.00092,"Social media has become integral to minors' daily lives and is used for various purposes, such as making friends, exploring shared interests, and engaging in educational activities. However, the increase in screen time has also led to heightened challenges, including cyberbullying, online grooming, and exploitations posed by malicious actors. Traditional content moderation techniques have proven ineffective against exploiters' evolving tactics. To address these growing challenges, we propose the EdgeAIGuard content moderation approach that is designed to protect minors from online grooming and various forms of digital exploitation. The proposed method comprises a multi-agent architecture deployed strategically at the network edge to enable rapid detection with low latency and prevent harmful content targeting minors. The experimental results show the proposed method is significantly more effective than the existing approaches."
2503.00093,"The proliferation of LLM bias probes introduces three significant challenges: (1) we lack principled criteria for choosing appropriate probes, (2) we lack a system for reconciling conflicting results across probes, and (3) we lack formal frameworks for reasoning about when (and why) probe results will generalize to real user behavior. We address these challenges by systematizing LLM social bias probing using actionable insights from social sciences. We then introduce EcoLevels - a framework that helps (a) determine appropriate bias probes, (b) reconcile conflicting findings across probes, and (c) generate predictions about bias generalization. Overall, we ground our analysis in social science research because many LLM probes are direct applications of human probes, and these fields have faced similar challenges when studying social bias in humans. Based on our work, we suggest how the next generation of LLM bias probing can (and should) benefit from decades of social science research."
2503.00278,"The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various fields, including education, for example, by enabling the creation of personalized learning materials. However, their use in Systematic Reviews (SRs) reveals limitations such as restricted access to specialized vocabularies, lack of domain-specific reasoning, and a tendency to generate inaccurate information. Existing SR tools often rely on traditional NLP methods and fail to address these issues adequately. To overcome these challenges, we developed the ``NeuroLit Navigator,'' a system that combines domain-specific LLMs with structured knowledge sources like Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). This integration enhances query formulation, expands search vocabularies, and deepens search scopes, enabling more precise searches. Deployed in multiple universities and tested by over a dozen librarians, the NeuroLit Navigator has reduced the time required for initial literature searches by 90\%. Despite this efficiency, the initial set of articles retrieved can vary in relevance and quality. Nonetheless, the system has greatly improved the reproducibility of search results, demonstrating its potential to support librarians in the SR process."
2503.00433,"This paper aims to present new alarming trends in the field of child sexual abuse through imagery, as part of SafeLine's research activities in the field of cybercrime, child sexual abuse material and the protection of children's rights to safe online experiences. It focuses primarily on the phenomenon of AI-generated CSAM, sophisticated ways employed for its production which are discussed in dark web forums and the crucial role that the open-source AI models play in the evolution of this overwhelming phenomenon. The paper's main contribution is a correlation analysis between the hotline's reports and domain names identified in dark web forums, where users' discussions focus on exchanging information specifically related to the generation of AI-CSAM. The objective was to reveal the close connection of clear net and dark web content, which was accomplished through the use of the ATLAS dataset of the Voyager system. Furthermore, through the analysis of a set of posts' content drilled from the above dataset, valuable conclusions on forum members' techniques employed for the production of AI-generated CSAM are also drawn, while users' views on this type of content and routes followed in order to overcome technological barriers set with the aim of preventing malicious purposes are also presented. As the ultimate contribution of this research, an overview of the current legislative developments in all country members of the INHOPE organization and the issues arising in the process of regulating the AI- CSAM is presented, shedding light in the legal challenges regarding the regulation and limitation of the phenomenon."
2503.00452,"The analysis of sales information, is a vital step in designing an effective marketing strategy. This work proposes a novel approach to analyse the shopping behaviour of customers to identify their purchase patterns. An extended version of the Multi-Cluster Overlapping k-Means Extension (MCOKE) algorithm with weighted k-Means algorithm is utilized to map customers to the garments of interest. The age & gender traits of the customer; the time spent and the expressions exhibited while selecting garments for purchase, are utilized to associate a customer or a group of customers to a garments they are interested in. Such study on the customer base of a retail business, may help in inferring the products of interest of their consumers, and enable them in developing effective business strategies, thus ensuring customer satisfaction, loyalty, increased sales and profits."
2503.0061,"Understanding how urban environments are perceived in terms of safety is crucial for urban planning and policymaking. Traditional methods like surveys are limited by high cost, required time, and scalability issues. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), specifically Llava 1.6 7B, as a novel approach to assess safety perceptions of urban spaces using street-view images. In addition, the research investigated how this task is affected by different socio-demographic perspectives, simulated by the model through Persona-based prompts. Without additional fine-tuning, the model achieved an average F1-score of 59.21% in classifying urban scenarios as safe or unsafe, identifying three key drivers of perceived unsafety: isolation, physical decay, and urban infrastructural challenges. Moreover, incorporating Persona-based prompts revealed significant variations in safety perceptions across the socio-demographic groups of age, gender, and nationality. Elder and female Personas consistently perceive higher levels of unsafety than younger or male Personas. Similarly, nationality-specific differences were evident in the proportion of unsafe classifications ranging from 19.71% in Singapore to 40.15% in Botswana. Notably, the model's default configuration aligned most closely with a middle-aged, male Persona. These findings highlight the potential of LMMs as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods for urban safety perceptions. While the sensitivity of these models to socio-demographic factors underscores the need for thoughtful deployment, their ability to provide nuanced perspectives makes them a promising tool for AI-driven urban planning."
2503.00632,"Improving social welfare is a complex challenge requiring policymakers to optimize objectives across multiple time horizons. Evaluating the impact of such policies presents a fundamental challenge, as those that appear suboptimal in the short run may yield significant long-term benefits. We tackle this challenge by analyzing the long-term dynamics of two prominent policy frameworks: Rawlsian policies, which prioritize those with the greatest need, and utilitarian policies, which maximize immediate welfare gains. Conventional wisdom suggests these policies are at odds, as Rawlsian policies are assumed to come at the cost of reducing the average social welfare, which their utilitarian counterparts directly optimize. We challenge this assumption by analyzing these policies in a sequential decision-making framework where individuals' welfare levels stochastically decay over time, and policymakers can intervene to prevent this decay. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove that interventions following Rawlsian policies can outperform utilitarian policies in the long run, even when the latter dominate in the short run. We characterize the exact conditions under which Rawlsian policies can outperform utilitarian policies. We further illustrate our theoretical findings using simulations, which highlight the risks of evaluating policies based solely on their short-term effects. Our results underscore the necessity of considering long-term horizons in designing and evaluating welfare policies; the true efficacy of even well-established policies may only emerge over time."
2503.00664,"The recent development and use of generative AI (GenAI) has signaled a significant shift in research activities such as brainstorming, proposal writing, dissemination, and even reviewing. This has raised questions about how to balance the seemingly productive uses of GenAI with ethical concerns such as authorship and copyright issues, use of biased training data, lack of transparency, and impact on user privacy. To address these concerns, many Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have released institutional guidance for researchers. To better understand the guidance that is being provided we report findings from a thematic analysis of guidelines from thirty HEIs in the United States that are classified as R1 or 'very high research activity.' We found that guidance provided to researchers: (1) asks them to refer to external sources of information such as funding agencies and publishers to keep updated and use institutional resources for training and education; (2) asks them to understand and learn about specific GenAI attributes that shape research such as predictive modeling, knowledge cutoff date, data provenance, and model limitations, and educate themselves about ethical concerns such as authorship, attribution, privacy, and intellectual property issues; and (3) includes instructions on how to acknowledge sources and disclose the use of GenAI, how to communicate effectively about their GenAI use, and alerts researchers to long term implications such as over reliance on GenAI, legal consequences, and risks to their institutions from GenAI use. Overall, guidance places the onus of compliance on individual researchers making them accountable for any lapses, thereby increasing their responsibility."
2503.00894,"Computing is increasingly central to innovation across a wide range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary problem domains. Students across noncomputing disciplines need to apply sophisticated computational skills and methods to fields as diverse as biology, linguistics, and art. Furthermore, computing plays a critical role in ""momentous geopolitical events"", such as elections in several countries including the US, and is changing how people ""work, collaborate, communicate, shop, eat, travel, get news and entertainment, and quite simply live"". Traditional computing courses, however, fail to equip non-computing discipline students with the necessary computing skills - if they can even get into classes packed with CS majors. A pressing question facing academics today is: How do we effectively integrate computing skills that are useful for the discipline into discipline curricula?We advocate an approach where courses in discipline X include the computing relevant to the learning outcomes of that course, as used by practitioners in X. We refer to the computing skills relevant to a course in discipline X as an ""ounce of computing skills"", to highlight our belief regarding the amount of computing to be integrated in that course. In this article, we outline our insights regarding the development of an ounce of computing skills for a discipline course, and the evaluation of the developed ounce. The key takeaways are that the goal has to be to advance students in their disciplines, and only the disciplinary experts can tell us how computing is used in that discipline. Computer scientists know how to teach computing, but the classes can't be about CS values. The disciplinary values are paramount."
2503.01,"Google's recent update to the manifest file for Chrome browser extensions, transitioning from manifest version 2 (MV2) to manifest version 3 (MV3), has raised concerns among users and ad blocker providers, who worry that the new restrictions, notably the shift from the powerful WebRequest API to the more restrictive DeclarativeNetRequest API, might reduce ad blocker effectiveness. Because ad blockers play a vital role for millions of users seeking a more private and ad-free browsing experience, this study empirically investigates how the MV3 update affects their ability to block ads and trackers. Through a browser-based experiment conducted across multiple samples of ad-supported websites, we compare the MV3 to MV2 instances of four widely used ad blockers. Our results reveal no statistically significant reduction in ad-blocking or anti-tracking effectiveness for MV3 ad blockers compared to their MV2 counterparts, and in some cases, MV3 instances even exhibit slight improvements in blocking trackers. These findings are reassuring for users, indicating that the MV3 instances of popular ad blockers continue to provide effective protection against intrusive ads and privacy-infringing trackers. While some uncertainties remain, ad blocker providers appear to have successfully navigated the MV3 update, finding solutions that maintain the core functionality of their extensions."
2503.01033,"Generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, will increasingly replace humans in producing output for a variety of important tasks. While much prior work has mostly focused on the improvement in the average performance of generative AI models relative to humans' performance, much less attention has been paid to the significant reduction of variance in output produced by generative AI models. In this Perspective, we demonstrate that generative AI models are inherently prone to the phenomenon of ""regression toward the mean"" whereby variance in output tends to shrink relative to that in real-world distributions. We discuss potential social implications of this phenomenon across three levels-societal, group, and individual-and two dimensions-material and non-material. Finally, we discuss interventions to mitigate negative effects, considering the roles of both service providers and users. Overall, this Perspective aims to raise awareness of the importance of output variance in generative AI and to foster collaborative efforts to meet the challenges posed by the reduction of variance in output generated by AI models."
2503.01369,"Advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have driven a growing effort to create digital duplicates. These semi-autonomous recreations of living and dead people can be used for many purposes. Some of these purposes include tutoring, coping with grief, and attending business meetings. However, the normative implications of digital duplicates remain obscure, particularly considering the possibility of them being applied to genocide memory and education. To address this gap, we examine normative possibilities and risks associated with the use of more advanced forms of generative AI-enhanced duplicates for transmitting Holocaust survivor testimonies. We first review the historical and contemporary uses of survivor testimonies. Then, we scrutinize the possible benefits of using digital duplicates in this context and apply the Minimally Viable Permissibility Principle (MVPP). The MVPP is an analytical framework for evaluating the risks of digital duplicates. It includes five core components: the need for authentic presence, consent, positive value, transparency, and harm-risk mitigation. Using MVPP, we identify potential harms digital duplicates might pose to different actors, including survivors, users, and developers. We also propose technical and socio-technical mitigation strategies to address these harms."
2503.0147,"The external evaluation of AI systems is increasingly recognised as a crucial approach for understanding their potential risks. However, facilitating external evaluation in practice faces significant challenges in balancing evaluators' need for system access with AI developers' privacy and security concerns. Additionally, evaluators have reason to protect their own privacy - for example, in order to maintain the integrity of held-out test sets. We refer to the challenge of ensuring both developers' and evaluators' privacy as one of providing mutual privacy. In this position paper, we argue that (i) addressing this mutual privacy challenge is essential for effective external evaluation of AI systems, and (ii) current methods for facilitating external evaluation inadequately address this challenge, particularly when it comes to preserving evaluators' privacy. In making these arguments, we formalise the mutual privacy problem; examine the privacy and access requirements of both model owners and evaluators; and explore potential solutions to this challenge, including through the application of cryptographic and hardware-based approaches."
2503.01532,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in simulating human behaviour and social intelligence. However, they risk perpetuating societal biases, especially when demographic information is involved. We introduce a novel framework using cosine distance to measure semantic shifts in responses and an LLM-judged Preference Win Rate (WR) to assess how demographic prompts affect response quality across power-disparate social scenarios. Evaluating five LLMs over 100 diverse social scenarios and nine demographic axes, our findings suggest a ""default persona"" bias toward middle-aged, able-bodied, native-born, Caucasian, atheistic males with centrist views. Moreover, interactions involving specific demographics are associated with lower-quality responses. Lastly, the presence of power disparities increases variability in response semantics and quality across demographic groups, suggesting that implicit biases may be heightened under power-imbalanced conditions. These insights expose the demographic biases inherent in LLMs and offer potential paths toward future bias mitigation efforts in LLMs."
2503.0155,"Multiple-choice exam questions with ""None of the above"" (NA) options have been extensively studied in educational testing, in which existing research suggests that they better assess true knowledge. However, their impact on Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluation remains underexplored. Through systematic experiments with 28 LLMs on the MMLU benchmark, we examine how NA options affect model performance and confidence calibration. Our analysis reveals that NA options, when used as the correct answer, lead to a consistent 30-50\% performance drop across models regardless of scale--suggesting that LLMs lack the meta-cognitive ability to systematically evaluate and reject all given options when none are correct. This degradation shows strong domain dependence, with minimal impact on mathematical reasoning (14.6\% drop) but severe effects on tasks requiring uncertainty handling like business ethics (48.1\% drop). Our results highlight important implications for benchmark design and raise questions about LLMs' ability to handle uncertainty in real-world applications."
2503.0156,"At least since Francis Bacon, the slogan 'knowledge is power' has been used to capture the relationship between decision-making at a group level and information. We know that being able to shape the informational environment for a group is a way to shape their decisions; it is essentially a way to make decisions for them. This paper focuses on strategies that are intentionally, by design, impactful on the decision-making capacities of groups, effectively shaping their ability to take advantage of information in their environment. Among these, the best known are political rhetoric, propaganda, and misinformation. The phenomenon this paper brings out from these is a relatively new strategy, which we call slopaganda. According to The Guardian, News Corp Australia is currently churning out 3000 'local' generative AI (GAI) stories each week. In the coming years, such 'generative AI slop' will present multiple knowledge-related (epistemic) challenges. We draw on contemporary research in cognitive science and artificial intelligence to diagnose the problem of slopaganda, describe some recent troubling cases, then suggest several interventions that may help to counter slopaganda."
2503.01686,"Masterminds are entities organizing, coordinating, and orchestrating cryptocurrency pump-and-dump schemes, a form of trade-based manipulation undermining market integrity and causing financial losses for unwitting investors. Previous research detects pump-and-dump activities in the market, predicts the target cryptocurrency, and examines investors and \ac{osn} entities. However, these solutions do not address the root cause of the problem. There is a critical gap in identifying and tracing the masterminds involved in these schemes. In this research, we develop a detection system \textsc{Perseus}, which collects real-time data from the \acs{osn} and cryptocurrency markets. \textsc{Perseus} then constructs temporal attributed graphs that preserve the direction of information diffusion and the structure of the community while leveraging \ac{gnn} to identify the masterminds behind pump-and-dump activities. Our design of \textsc{Perseus} leads to higher F1 scores and precision than the \ac{sota} fraud detection method, achieving fast training and inferring speeds. Deployed in the real world from February 16 to October 9 2024, \textsc{Perseus} successfully detects $438$ masterminds who are efficient in the pump-and-dump information diffusion networks. \textsc{Perseus} provides regulators with an explanation of the risks of masterminds and oversight capabilities to mitigate the pump-and-dump schemes of cryptocurrency."
2503.01694,"Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational practice enables personalized learning by accommodating diverse learner behaviors. This study explored diverse learner profiles within a multi-agent, LLM-empowered learning environment. Data was collected from 312 undergraduate students at a university in China as they participated in a six-module course. Based on hierarchical cluster analyses of system profiles and student-AI interactive dialogues, we found that students exhibit varied behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement tendencies. This analysis allowed us to identify two types of dropouts (early dropouts and stagnating interactors) and three completer profiles (active questioners, responsive navigators, and lurkers). The results showed that high levels of interaction do not always equate to productive learning and vice versa. Prior knowledge significantly influenced interaction patterns and short-term learning benefits. Further analysis of the human-AI dialogues revealed that some students actively engaged in knowledge construction, while others displayed a high frequency of regulatory behaviors. Notably, both groups of students achieved comparable learning gains, demonstrating the effectiveness of the multi-agent learning environment in supporting personalized learning. These results underscore the complex and multifaceted nature of engagement in human-AI collaborative learning and provide practical implications for the design of adaptive educational systems."
2503.02099,"Reading assessments are essential for enhancing students' comprehension, yet many EdTech applications focus mainly on outcome-based metrics, providing limited insights into student behavior and cognition. This study investigates the use of multimodal data sources -- including eye-tracking data, learning outcomes, assessment content, and teaching standards -- to derive meaningful reading insights. We employ unsupervised learning techniques to identify distinct reading behavior patterns, and then a large language model (LLM) synthesizes the derived information into actionable reports for educators, streamlining the interpretation process. LLM experts and human educators evaluate these reports for clarity, accuracy, relevance, and pedagogical usefulness. Our findings indicate that LLMs can effectively function as educational analysts, turning diverse data into teacher-friendly insights that are well-received by educators. While promising for automating insight generation, human oversight remains crucial to ensure reliability and fairness. This research advances human-centered AI in education, connecting data-driven analytics with practical classroom applications."
2503.0225,"There is a growing proliferation of AI systems designed to mimic people's behavior, work, abilities, likenesses, or humanness -- systems we dub AI automatons. Individuals, groups, or generic humans are being simulated to produce creative work in their styles, to respond to surveys in their places, to probe how they would use a new system before deployment, to provide users with assistance and companionship, and to anticipate their possible future behavior and interactions with others, just to name a few applications. The research, design, deployment, and availability of such AI systems have, however, also prompted growing concerns about a wide range of possible legal, ethical, and other social impacts. To both 1) facilitate productive discussions about whether, when, and how to design and deploy such systems, and 2) chart the current landscape of existing and prospective AI automatons, we need to tease apart determinant design axes and considerations that can aid our understanding of whether and how various design choices along these axes could mitigate -- or instead exacerbate -- potential adverse impacts that the development and use of AI automatons could give rise to. In this paper, through a synthesis of related literature and extensive examples of existing AI systems intended to mimic humans, we develop a conceptual framework to help foreground key axes of design variations and provide analytical scaffolding to foster greater recognition of the design choices available to developers, as well as the possible ethical implications these choices might have."
2503.02532,"The use of large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT, has become popular across various domains, supporting a range of tasks and processes. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of LLMs, effective prompting is more challenging than it may seem. This highlights the need for innovative educational and support strategies that are both widely accessible and seamlessly integrated into task workflows. Yet, LLM prompting is highly task- and domain-dependent, limiting the effectiveness of generic approaches. In this study, we explore whether LLM-based methods can facilitate learning assessments by using ad-hoc guidelines and a minimal number of annotated prompt samples. Our framework transforms these guidelines into features that can be identified within learners' prompts. Using these feature descriptions and annotated examples, we create few-shot learning detectors. We then evaluate different configurations of these detectors, testing three state-of-the-art LLMs and ensembles. We run experiments with cross-validation on a sample of original prompts, as well as tests on prompts collected from task-naive learners. Our results show how LLMs perform on feature detection. Notably, GPT- 4 demonstrates strong performance on most features, while closely related models, such as GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 Turbo (Instruct), show inconsistent behaviors in feature classification. These differences highlight the need for further research into how design choices impact feature selection and prompt detection. Our findings contribute to the fields of generative AI literacy and computer-supported learning assessment, offering valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners."
2503.02784,"This paper argues that a dataset's legal risk cannot be accurately assessed by its license terms alone; instead, tracking dataset redistribution and its full lifecycle is essential. However, this process is too complex for legal experts to handle manually at scale. Tracking dataset provenance, verifying redistribution rights, and assessing evolving legal risks across multiple stages require a level of precision and efficiency that exceeds human capabilities. Addressing this challenge effectively demands AI agents that can systematically trace dataset redistribution, analyze compliance, and identify legal risks. We develop an automated data compliance system called NEXUS and show that AI can perform these tasks with higher accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness than human experts. Our massive legal analysis of 17,429 unique entities and 8,072 license terms using this approach reveals the discrepancies in legal rights between the original datasets before redistribution and their redistributed subsets, underscoring the necessity of the data lifecycle-aware compliance. For instance, we find that out of 2,852 datasets with commercially viable individual license terms, only 605 (21%) are legally permissible for commercialization. This work sets a new standard for AI data governance, advocating for a framework that systematically examines the entire lifecycle of dataset redistribution to ensure transparent, legal, and responsible dataset management."
2503.02885,"In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly gained popularity across all parts of society, including education. After initial skepticism and bans, many schools have chosen to embrace this new technology by integrating it into their curricula in the form of virtual tutors and teaching assistants. However, neither the companies developing this technology nor the public institutions involved in its implementation have set up a formal system to collect feedback from the stakeholders impacted by them. In this paper, we argue that understanding the perceptions of those directly or indirectly impacted by LLMs in the classroom, including parents and school staff, is essential for ensuring responsible use of AI in this critical domain.Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose the Contextualized Perceptions for the Adoption of LLMs in Education (Co-PALE) framework, which can be used to systematically elicit perceptions and inform whether and how LLM-based tools should be designed, developed, and deployed in the classroom. Second, we explain how our framework can be used to ground specific rubrics for eliciting perceptions of the relevant stakeholders in view of specific goals and context of implementation. Overall, Co-PALE is a practical step toward helping educational agents, policymakers, researchers, and technologists ensure the responsible and effective deployment of LLM-based systems across diverse learning contexts."
2503.02952,"Ambition and risk-taking have been heralded as important ways for marginalized communities to get out of cycles of poverty. As a result, educational messaging often encourages individuals to strengthen their personal resolve and develop characteristics such as discipline and grit to succeed in ambitious ends. However, recent work in philosophy and sociology highlights that this messaging often does more harm than good for students in these situations. We study similar questions using a different epistemic approach and in simple theoretical models -- we provide a quantitative model of decision-making between stable and risky choices in the improving multi-armed bandits framework. We use this model to first study how individuals' ""strategies"" are affected by their level of grittiness and how this affects their accrued rewards. Then, we study the impact of various interventions, such as increasing grit or providing a financial safety net. Our investigation of rational decision making involves two different formal models of rationality, the competitive ratio between the accrued reward and the optimal reward and Bayesian quantification of uncertainty."

With the growing emphasis on utilizing advanced technologies in healthcare, this protocol aims to harness the potential of IoT devices to optimize patient monitoring, enable remote care, and support clinical decision-making. By integrating IoT seamlessly into nursing workflows and patient care plans, hospitals can achieve higher levels of patient-centric care and real-time data insights, leading to better treatment outcomes and resource allocation. This paper outlines the protocol's objectives, key components, and expected benefits, while emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations and ongoing evaluation to ensure successful implementation."
2503.03752,"Online gambling platforms have transformed the gambling landscape, offering unprecedented accessibility and personalized experiences. However, these same characteristics have increased the risk of gambling-related harm, affecting individuals, families, and communities. Structural factors, including targeted marketing, shifting social norms, and gaps in regulation, further complicate the challenge. This narrative review examines how artificial intelligence, particularly multimodal generative models and foundation technologies, can address these issues by supporting prevention, early identification, and harm-reduction efforts. We detail applications such as synthetic data generation to overcome research barriers, customized interventions to guide safer behaviors, gamified tools to support recovery, and scenario modeling to inform effective policies. Throughout, we emphasize the importance of safeguarding privacy and ensuring that technological advances are responsibly aligned with public health objectives."
2503.03849,"In the face of intensified datafication and automation in public sector industries, frameworks like design justice and the feminist practice of refusal provide help to identify and mitigate structural harm and challenge inequities reproduced in digitized infrastructures. This paper applies those frameworks to emerging efforts across the U.S. healthcare industry to automate prior authorization -- a process whereby insurance companies determine whether a treatment or service is 'medically necessary' before agreeing to cover it. Federal regulatory interventions turn to datafication and automation to reduce the harms of this widely unpopular process shown to delay vital treatments and create immense administrative burden for healthcare providers and patients. This paper explores emerging prior authorization reforms as a case study, applying the frameworks of design justice and refusal to highlight the inherent conservatism of interventions oriented towards improving the user experience of extractive systems. I further explore how the abolitionist framework of non-reformist reform helps to clarify alternative interventions that would mitigate the harms of prior authorization in ways that do not reproduce or extend the power of insurance companies. I propose a set of four tenets for nonreformist design to mitigate structural harms and advance design justice in a broad set of domains."
2503.03939,"Sudden attention on social media, and how users navigate these contextual shifts, has been a focus of much recent work in social media research. Even when this attention is not harassing, some users experience this sudden growth as overwhelming. In this workshop paper, I outline how growth infuses the design of much of the modern social media platform landscape, and then explore why applying a post-growth lens to platform design could be productive."
2503.04267,"Computing students increasingly rely on generative AI tools for programming assistance, often without formal instruction or guidance. This highlights a need to teach students how to effectively interact with AI models, particularly through natural language prompts, to generate and critically evaluate code for solving computational tasks. To address this, we developed a novel platform for prompt programming that enables authentic dialogue-based interactions, supports problems involving multiple interdependent functions, and offers on-request execution of generated code. Data analysis from over 900 students in an introductory programming course revealed high engagement, with the majority of prompts occurring within multi-turn dialogues. Problems with multiple interdependent functions encouraged iterative refinement, with progression graphs highlighting several common strategies. Students were highly selective about the code they chose to test, suggesting that on-request execution of generated code promoted critical thinking. Given the growing importance of learning dialogue-based programming with AI, we provide this tool as a publicly accessible resource, accompanied by a corpus of programming problems for educational use."
2503.04343,"While XAI focuses on providing AI explanations to humans, can the reverse - humans explaining their judgments to AI - foster richer, synergistic human-AI systems? This paper explores various forms of human inputs to AI and examines how human explanations can guide machine learning models toward automated judgments and explanations that align more closely with human concepts."
2503.04729,"The Urban Metaverse describes an immersive 3D environment that connects the physical world of the city and its citizens with its digital data and systems. Physical and digital realities merge, opening up new possibilities for the design and use of the city. This trend study serves as a source of inspiration and guidance for city and community leaders, urban planners, IT professionals, and anyone interested in the future of urban spaces. It helps to understand the opportunities and challenges of the urban metaverse as an evolution of the Smart City and to set the course for sustainable and innovative urban development. To this end, the study analyzes the opportunities that the urban metaverse offers for urban administration and the everyday life of citizens, presents key technologies, and highlights the socio-economic challenges of implementation. The focus is on the potential of the urban metaverse to optimize the planning and operation of urban infrastructures, to promote inclusion and civic participation, and to enhance the innovative capacity of cities and municipalities. The study develops four recommendations for the implementation of metaverse applications in an urban context: 1. user-centered design, 2. ubiquitous accessibility, 3. proactive design of the regulatory framework, and 4. development of viable business models."
2503.04732,"This article presents an ongoing research aiming to develop an effective methodology for teaching programming, focusing on participation in the Brazilian Informatics Olympiad (OBI), for elementary and high school students. The training conducted with students from the Federal Institute and state schools, demonstrates the importance of programming training programs as a way to promote interest in computing, stimulate the development of computational skills, and increase participation in competitions such as the OBI. The next steps of the research include conducting more training cycles and analyzing the results obtained in the competitions."
2503.04733,"Generative AI enables automated, effective manipulation at scale. Despite the growing general ethical discussion around generative AI, the specific manipulation risks remain inadequately investigated. This article outlines essential inquiries encompassing conceptual, empirical, and design dimensions of manipulation, pivotal for comprehending and curbing manipulation risks. By highlighting these questions, the article underscores the necessity of an appropriate conceptualisation of manipulation to ensure the responsible development of Generative AI technologies."
2503.04734,"Food systems are responsible for a third of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. We investigate what Large Language Models (LLMs) can contribute to reducing the environmental impacts of food production. We define a typology of design and prediction tasks based on the sustainable food literature and collaboration with domain experts, and evaluate six LLMs on four tasks in our typology. For example, for a sustainable protein design task, food science experts estimated that collaboration with an LLM can reduce time spent by 45% on average, compared to 22% for collaboration with another expert human food scientist. However, for a sustainable menu design task, LLMs produce suboptimal solutions when instructed to consider both human satisfaction and climate impacts. We propose a general framework for integrating LLMs with combinatorial optimization to improve reasoning capabilities. Our approach decreases emissions of food choices by 79% in a hypothetical restaurant while maintaining participants' satisfaction with their set of choices. Our results demonstrate LLMs' potential, supported by optimization techniques, to accelerate sustainable food development and adoption."
2503.04735,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, necessitating a deeper understanding of their decision-making behaviour under risk. This study investigates the relationship between LLMs' personality traits and risk propensity, employing cumulative prospect theory (CPT) and the Big Five personality framework. We focus on GPT-4o, comparing its behaviour to human baselines and earlier models. Our findings reveal that GPT-4o exhibits higher Conscientiousness and Agreeableness traits compared to human averages, while functioning as a risk-neutral rational agent in prospect selection. Interventions on GPT-4o's Big Five traits, particularly Openness, significantly influence its risk propensity, mirroring patterns observed in human studies. Notably, Openness emerges as the most influential factor in GPT-4o's risk propensity, aligning with human findings. In contrast, legacy models like GPT-4-Turbo demonstrate inconsistent generalization of the personality-risk relationship. This research advances our understanding of LLM behaviour under risk and elucidates the potential and limitations of personality-based interventions in shaping LLM decision-making. Our findings have implications for the development of more robust and predictable AI systems such as financial modelling."
2503.04736,"Technical standards, or simply standards, are established documented guidelines and rules that facilitate the interoperability, quality, and accuracy of systems and processes. In recent years, we have witnessed an emerging paradigm shift where the adoption of generative AI (GenAI) models has increased tremendously, spreading implementation interests across standard-driven industries, including engineering, legal, healthcare, and education. In this paper, we assess the criticality levels of different standards across domains and sectors and complement them by grading the current compliance capabilities of state-of-the-art GenAI models. To support the discussion, we outline possible challenges and opportunities with integrating GenAI for standard compliance tasks while also providing actionable recommendations for entities involved with developing and using standards. Overall, we argue that aligning GenAI with standards through computational methods can help strengthen regulatory and operational compliance. We anticipate this area of research will play a central role in the management, oversight, and trustworthiness of larger, more powerful GenAI-based systems in the near future."
2503.04737,"Detection of carelessness in digital learning platforms has relied on the contextual slip model, which leverages conditional probability and Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) to identify careless errors, where students make mistakes despite having the knowledge. However, this model cannot effectively assess carelessness in questions tagged with multiple skills due to the use of conditional probability. This limitation narrows the scope within which the model can be applied. Thus, we propose a novel model, the Beyond Knowledge Feature Carelessness (BKFC) model. The model detects careless errors using performance factor analysis (PFA) and behavioral features distilled from log data, controlling for knowledge when detecting carelessness. We applied the BKFC to detect carelessness in data from middle school students playing a learning game on decimal numbers and operations. We conducted analyses comparing the careless errors detected using contextual slip to the BKFC model. Unexpectedly, careless errors identified by these two approaches did not align. We found students' post-test performance was (corresponding to past results) positively associated with the carelessness detected using the contextual slip model, while negatively associated with the carelessness detected using the BKFC model. These results highlight the complexity of carelessness and underline a broader challenge in operationalizing carelessness and careless errors."
2503.04738,"In Thaler v The Comptroller-General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks (DABUS), Smith J. held that an AI owner can possibly claim patent ownership over an AI-generated invention based on their ownership and control of the AI system. This AI-owner approach reveals a new option to allocate property rights over AI-generated output. While this judgment was primarily about inventorship and ownership of AI-generated invention in patent law, it has important implications for copyright law. After analysing the weaknesses of applying existing judicial approaches to copyright ownership of AI-generated works, this paper examines whether the AI-owner approach is a better option for determining copyright ownership of AI-generated works. The paper argues that while contracts can be used to work around the AI-owner approach in scenarios where users want to commercially exploit the outputs, this approach still provides more certainty and less transaction costs for relevant parties than other approaches proposed so far."
2503.04739,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has matured as a technology, necessitating the development of responsibility frameworks that are fair, inclusive, trustworthy, safe and secure, transparent, and accountable. By establishing such frameworks, we can harness the full potential of AI while mitigating its risks, particularly in high-risk scenarios. This requires the design of responsible AI systems based on trustworthy AI technologies and ethical principles, with the aim of ensuring auditability and accountability throughout their design, development, and deployment, adhering to domain-specific regulations and standards.This paper explores the concept of a responsible AI system from a holistic perspective, which encompasses four key dimensions: 1) regulatory context; 2) trustworthy AI technology along with standardization and assessments; 3) auditability and accountability; and 4) AI governance. The aim of this paper is double. First, we analyze and understand these four dimensions and their interconnections in the form of an analysis and overview. Second, the final goal of the paper is to propose a roadmap in the design of responsible AI systems, ensuring that they can gain society's trust. To achieve this trustworthiness, this paper also fosters interdisciplinary discussions on the ethical, legal, social, economic, and cultural aspects of AI from a global governance perspective. Last but not least, we also reflect on the current state and those aspects that need to be developed in the near future, as ten lessons learned."
2503.0474,"In this work, we propose Perspective Reasoning for Integrated Synthesis and Mediation (PRISM), a multiple-perspective framework for addressing persistent challenges in AI alignment such as conflicting human values and specification gaming. Grounded in cognitive science and moral psychology, PRISM organizes moral concerns into seven ""basis worldviews"", each hypothesized to capture a distinct dimension of human moral cognition, ranging from survival-focused reflexes through higher-order integrative perspectives. It then applies a Pareto-inspired optimization scheme to reconcile competing priorities without reducing them to a single metric. Under the assumption of reliable context validation for robust use, the framework follows a structured workflow that elicits viewpoint-specific responses, synthesizes them into a balanced outcome, and mediates remaining conflicts in a transparent and iterative manner. By referencing layered approaches to moral cognition from cognitive science, moral psychology, and neuroscience, PRISM clarifies how different moral drives interact and systematically documents and mediates ethical tradeoffs. We illustrate its efficacy through real outputs produced by a working prototype, applying PRISM to classic alignment problems in domains such as public health policy, workplace automation, and education. By anchoring AI deliberation in these human vantage points, PRISM aims to bound interpretive leaps that might otherwise drift into non-human or machine-centric territory. We briefly outline future directions, including real-world deployments and formal verifications, while maintaining the core focus on multi-perspective synthesis and conflict mediation."
2503.04741,"The UK AI Safety Institute (UK AISI) and its parallel organisation in the United States (US AISI) take up a unique position in the recently established International Network of AISIs. Both are in jurisdictions with frontier AI companies and are assuming leading roles in the international conversation on AI Safety. This paper argues that it is in the interest of both institutions to share specific categories of information with the International Network of AISIs, deliberately abstain from sharing others and carefully evaluate sharing some categories on a case by case basis, according to domestic priorities. The paper further proposes a provisional framework with which policymakers and researchers can distinguish between these three cases, taking into account the potential benefits and risks of sharing specific categories of information, ranging from pre-deployment evaluation results to evaluation standards. In an effort to further improve the research on AI policy relevant information sharing decisions, the paper emphasises the importance of continuously monitoring fluctuating factors influencing sharing decisions and a more in-depth analysis of specific policy relevant information categories and additional factors to consider in future research."
2503.04742,"With the rise of large multi-modal AI models, fuelled by recent interest in large language models (LLMs), the notion of artificial general intelligence (AGI) went from being restricted to a fringe community, to dominate mainstream large AI development programs. In contrast, in this paper, we make a case for specialisation, by reviewing the pitfalls of generality and stressing the industrial value of specialised systems.Our contribution is threefold. First, we review the most widely accepted arguments against specialisation, and discuss how their relevance in the context of human labour is actually an argument for specialisation in the case of non human agents, be they algorithms or human organisations. Second, we propose four arguments in favor of specialisation, ranging from machine learning robustness, to computer security, social sciences and cultural evolution. Third, we finally make a case for specification, discuss how the machine learning approach to AI has so far failed to catch up with good practices from safety-engineering and formal verification of software, and discuss how some emerging good practices in machine learning help reduce this gap. In particular, we justify the need for specified governance for hard-to-specify systems."
2503.04743,"Safety has become the central value around which dominant AI governance efforts are being shaped. Recently, this culminated in the publication of the International AI Safety Report, written by 96 experts of which 30 nominated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Union (EU), and the United Nations (UN). The report focuses on the safety risks of general-purpose AI and available technical mitigation approaches. In this response, informed by a system safety perspective, I refl ect on the key conclusions of the report, identifying fundamental issues in the currently dominant technical framing of AI safety and how this frustrates meaningful discourse and policy efforts to address safety comprehensively. The system safety discipline has dealt with the safety risks of software-based systems for many decades, and understands safety risks in AI systems as sociotechnical and requiring consideration of technical and non-technical factors and their interactions. The International AI Safety report does identify the need for system safety approaches. Lessons, concepts and methods from system safety indeed provide an important blueprint for overcoming current shortcomings in technical approaches by integrating rather than adding on non-technical factors and interventions. I conclude with why building a system safety discipline can help us overcome limitations in the European AI Act, as well as how the discipline can help shape sustainable investments into Public Interest AI."
2503.04744,"Safety cases - clear, assessable arguments for the safety of a system in a given context - are a widely-used technique across various industries for showing a decision-maker (e.g. boards, customers, third parties) that a system is safe. In this paper, we cover how and why frontier AI developers might also want to use safety cases. We then argue that writing and reviewing safety cases would substantially assist in the fulfilment of many of the Frontier AI Safety Commitments. Finally, we outline open research questions on the methodology, implementation, and technical details of safety cases."
2503.04745,"This report analyzes key trends, challenges, risks, and opportunities associated with the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) globally. It examines national experiences in developing LLMs and assesses the feasibility of investment in this sector. Additionally, the report explores strategies for implementing, regulating, and financing AI projects at the state level."
2503.04746,"As part of the Frontier AI Safety Commitments agreed to at the 2024 AI Seoul Summit, many AI developers agreed to publish a safety framework outlining how they will manage potential severe risks associated with their systems. This paper summarises current thinking from companies, governments, and researchers on how to write an effective safety framework. We outline three core areas of a safety framework - risk identification and assessment, risk mitigation, and governance - and identify emerging practices within each area. As safety frameworks are novel and rapidly developing, we hope that this paper can serve both as an overview of work to date and as a starting point for further discussion and innovation."
2503.04747,"Despite the much proliferation of AI ethical principles in recent years, there is a challenge of assuring AI ethics with current AI ethics frameworks in real-world applications. While system safety has emerged as a distinct discipline for a long time, originated from safety concerns in early aircraft manufacturing. The safety assurance is now an indispensable component in safety critical domains. Motivated by the assurance approaches for safety-critical systems such as aviation, this paper introduces the concept of AI ethics assurance cases into the AI ethics assurance. Three pillars of user requirements, evidence, and validation are proposed as key components and integrated into AI ethics assurance cases for a new approach of user requirements-oriented AI ethics assurance. The user requirements-oriented AI ethics assurance case is set up based on three pillars and hazard analysis methods used in the safety assurance of safety-critical systems. This paper also proposes a platform named Ethical-Lens (E-LENS) to implement the user requirements-oriented AI ethics assurance approach. The proposed user requirements-based E-LENS platform is then applied to assure AI ethics of an AI-driven human resource shortlisting system as a case study to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
2503.04748,"Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for transforming healthcare, from streamlining administrative and clinical workflows to enriching patient engagement and advancing clinical decision-making. However, their successful integration requires rigorous development, adaptation, and evaluation strategies tailored to clinical needs. In this Review, we highlight recent advancements, explore emerging opportunities for LLM-driven innovation, and propose a framework for their responsible implementation in healthcare settings. We examine strategies for adapting LLMs to domain-specific healthcare tasks, such as fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and multimodal integration with electronic health records. We also summarize various evaluation metrics tailored to healthcare, addressing clinical accuracy, fairness, robustness, and patient outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges associated with deploying LLMs in healthcare--including data privacy, bias mitigation, regulatory compliance, and computational sustainability--and underscore the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. Finally, these challenges present promising future research directions for advancing LLM implementation in clinical settings and healthcare."
2503.04749,"The petrochemical industry faces significant technological, environmental, occupational safety, and financial challenges. Since its emergence in the 1920s, technologies that were once innovative have now become obsolete. However, factors such as the protection of trade secrets in industrial processes, limited budgets for research and development, doubts about the reliability of new technologies, and resistance to change from decision-makers have hindered the adoption of new approaches, such as the use of IoT devices. This paper addresses the challenges and opportunities presented by the research, development, and implementation of these technologies in the industry. It also analyzes the investment in research and development made by companies in the sector in recent years and provides a review of current research and implementations related to Industry 4.0."
2503.0475,"This position paper argues that AI agents should be regulated by the extent to which they operate autonomously. AI agents with long-term planning and strategic capabilities can pose significant risks of human extinction and irreversible global catastrophes. While existing regulations often focus on computational scale as a proxy for potential harm, we argue that such measures are insufficient for assessing the risks posed by agents whose capabilities arise primarily from inference-time computation. To support our position, we discuss relevant regulations and recommendations from scientists regarding existential risks, as well as the advantages of using action sequences -- which reflect the degree of an agent's autonomy -- as a more suitable measure of potential impact than existing metrics that rely on observing environmental states."
2503.04751,"The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Higher Education (HE) is transforming personalized learning, administrative automation, and decision-making. However, this progress presents a duality, as AI adoption also introduces ethical and institutional challenges, including algorithmic bias, data privacy risks, and governance inconsistencies. To address these concerns, this study introduces the Human-Driven AI in Higher Education (HD-AIHED) Framework, ensuring compliance with UNESCO and OECD ethical standards. This conceptual research employs a qualitative meta-synthesis approach, integrating qualitative and quantitative studies to identify patterns, contradictions, and gaps in AI adoption within HE. It reinterprets existing datasets through theoretical and ethical lenses to develop governance frameworks. The study applies a participatory integrated co-system, Phased Human Intelligence, SWOC analysis, and AI ethical review boards to assess AI readiness and governance strategies for universities and HE institutions. The HD-AIHED model bridges AI research gaps, addresses global real-time challenges, and provides tailored, scalable, and ethical strategies for diverse educational contexts. By emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration among stakeholders, this study envisions AIHED as a transparent and equitable force for innovation. The HD-AIHED framework ensures AI acts as a collaborative and ethical enabler rather than a disruptive replacement for human intelligence while advocating for responsible AI implementation in HE."
2503.04752,"The development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential for redefining student assessment methodologies. This paper aims to establish the idea of the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its prospect in reshaping approaches to assessing students. It creates a system for the evaluation of students performance using Artificial intelligence, and particularly the Gemini API for the generation of questions, grading and report on the students performances. This is to facilitate easy use of the tools in creating, scheduling, and delivering assessments with minimal chances of cheating through options such as full screen and time limit. There are formats of questions in the system which comprises multiple choice, short answers and descriptive questions, developed by Gemini. The most conspicuous feature is the self-checking system whereby the user gets instant feedback for the correct score that each of the students would have scored instantly with explanations about wrong answers. Moreover, the platform has intelligent learning progressions where the user will be able to monitor his/her performances to be recommended a certain level of performance. It will allow students as well as educators to have real-time analytics and feedback on what they are good at and where they need to improve. Not only does it make the assessment easier, but it also improves the levels of accuracy in grading and effectively strengthens a data based learning process for students."
2503.04753,"This document describes the development and implementation of a technological solution based on IoT devices to modernize a machine known as the Cyclone. This equipment is used by a contractor collaborating with petrochemical companies in the state of Texas, performing specialized work in mechanics, engineering, catalytic material replacement, and rescue operations in refinery complexes. The Cyclone machine, with outdated relay logic technology, poses challenges in terms of operational efficiency, critical condition monitoring, and safety. The project was carried out with the collaboration of specialists in equipment handling, focusing on demonstrating the feasibility of integrating advanced Industry 4.0 technologies into legacy industrial equipment. The methodology included the incorporation of IoT sensors for real-time monitoring, an automated control system, and the digitization of key processes. Preliminary results indicate improvements in the precision of operational control and the ability for remote supervision, highlighting the potential for modernization in critical industrial applications. This work not only validates the use of IoT devices in obsolete equipment but also sets a precedent for the transition towards more sustainable and efficient technologies in the petrochemical sector."

2503.04755,"Deriving nutritional information from online food posts is challenging, particularly when users do not explicitly log the macro-nutrients of a shared meal. In this work, we present an efficient and straightforward approach to approximating macro-nutrients based solely on the titles of food posts. Our method combines a public food database from the U.S. Department of Agriculture with advanced text embedding techniques. We evaluate the approach on a labeled food dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness, and apply it to over 500,000 real-world posts from Reddit's popular /r/food subreddit to uncover trends in food-sharing behavior based on the estimated macro-nutrient content. Altogether, this work lays a foundation for researchers and practitioners aiming to estimate caloric and nutritional content using only text data."
2503.04756,"The rapid advancement in building large language models (LLMs) has intensified competition among big-tech companies and AI startups. In this regard, model evaluations are critical for product and investment-related decision-making. While open evaluation sets like MMLU initially drove progress, concerns around data contamination and data bias have constantly questioned their reliability. As a result, it has led to the rise of private data curators who have begun conducting hidden evaluations with high-quality self-curated test prompts and their own expert annotators. In this paper, we argue that despite potential advantages in addressing contamination issues, private evaluations introduce inadvertent financial and evaluation risks. In particular, the key concerns include the potential conflict of interest arising from private data curators' business relationships with their clients (leading LLM firms). In addition, we highlight that the subjective preferences of private expert annotators will lead to inherent evaluation bias towards the models trained with the private curators' data. Overall, this paper lays the foundation for studying the risks of private evaluations that can lead to wide-ranging community discussions and policy changes."
2503.04757,"Short-term forecasting of residential electricity demand is an important task for utilities. Yet, many small and medium-sized utilities still use simple forecasting approaches such as Synthesized Load Profiles, which treat residential households similarly and neither account for renewable energy installations nor novel large consumers (e.g., heat pumps, electric vehicles). The effectiveness of such ""one-fits-all"" approaches in future grid states--where decentral generation and sector coupling increases--are questionable. Our study challenges these forecasting practices and investigates whether Machine Learning (ML) approaches are suited to predict electricity demand in today's and in future grid states. We use real smart meter data from 3,511 households in Germany over 34 months. We extrapolate this data with future grid states (i.e., increased decentral generation and storage) based on a digital twin of a local energy system. Our results show that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approaches outperform SLPs as well as simple benchmark estimators with up to 68.5% lower Root Mean Squared Error for a day-ahead forecast, especially in future grid states. Nevertheless, all prediction approaches perform worse in future grid states. Our findings therefore reinforce the need (a) for utilities and grid operators to employ ML approaches instead of traditional demand prediction methods in future grid states and (b) to prepare current ML methods for future grid states."
2503.04758,"The AI revolution is gathering momentum at an unprecedented rate. Over the past decade, we have witnessed a seemingly inevitable integration of AI in every facet of our lives. Much has been written about the potential revolutionary impact of AI in education. AI has the potential to completely revolutionise the educational landscape as we could see entire courses and degrees developed by programs such as ChatGPT. AI has the potential to develop courses, set assignments, grade and provide feedback to students much faster than a team of teachers. In addition, because of its dynamic nature, it has the potential to continuously improve its content. In certain fields such as computer science, where technology is continuously evolving, AI based applications can provide dynamically changing, relevant material to students. AI has the potential to replace entire degrees and may challenge the concept of higher education institutions. We could also see entire new disciplines emerge as a consequence of AI. This paper examines the practical impact of ChatGPT and why it is believed that its implementation is a critical step towards a new era of education. We investigate the impact that ChatGPT will have on learning, problem solving skills and cognitive ability of students. We examine the positives, negatives and many other aspects of AI and its applications throughout this paper."

2503.04761,"Despite widespread speculation about artificial intelligence's impact on the future of work, we lack systematic empirical evidence about how these systems are actually being used for different tasks. Here, we present a novel framework for measuring AI usage patterns across the economy. We leverage a recent privacy-preserving system to analyze over four millionthis http URLconversations through the lens of tasks and occupations in the U.S. Department of Labor's O*NET Database. Our analysis reveals that AI usage primarily concentrates in software development and writing tasks, which together account for nearly half of all total usage. However, usage of AI extends more broadly across the economy, with approximately 36% of occupations using AI for at least a quarter of their associated tasks. We also analyze how AI is being used for tasks, finding 57% of usage suggests augmentation of human capabilities (e.g., learning or iterating on an output) while 43% suggests automation (e.g., fulfilling a request with minimal human involvement). While our data and methods face important limitations and only paint a picture of AI usage on a single platform, they provide an automated, granular approach for tracking AI's evolving role in the economy and identifying leading indicators of future impact as these technologies continue to advance."
2503.04764,"Over the past four decades, cheerleading has evolved from a sideline activity at major sporting events into a professional, competitive sport with growing global popularity. Evaluating tumbling elements in cheerleading relies on both objective measures and subjective judgments, such as difficulty and execution quality. However, the complexity of tumbling - encompassing team synchronicity, ground interactions, choreography, and artistic expression - makes objective assessment challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various scientific fields and industries through precise data-driven analyses, yet their application in acrobatic sports remains limited despite significant potential for enhancing performance evaluation and coaching. This study investigates the feasibility of using an AI-based approach with data from a single inertial measurement unit to accurately identify and objectively assess tumbling elements in standard cheerleading routines. A sample of 16 participants (13 females, 3 males) from a Division I collegiate cheerleading team wore a single inertial measurement unit at the dorsal pelvis. Over a 4-week seasonal preparation period, 1102 tumbling elements were recorded during regular practice sessions. Using triaxial accelerations and rotational speeds, various ML algorithms were employed to classify and evaluate the execution of tumbling manoeuvres. Results indicate that certain machine learning models can effectively identify different tumbling elements despite inter-individual variability and data noise, achieving high accuracy. These findings demonstrate the significant potential for integrating AI-driven assessments into cheerleading and other acrobatic sports, providing objective metrics that complement traditional judging methods."
2503.04765,"DeepSeek v3, developed in China, was released in December 2024, followed by Alibaba's Qwen 2.5 Max in January 2025 and Qwen3 235B in April 2025. These free and open-source models offer significant potential for academic writing and content creation. This study evaluates their academic writing performance by comparing them with ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, and Gemma. There is a critical gap in the literature concerning how extensively these tools can be utilized and their potential to generate original content in terms of quality, readability, and effectiveness. Using 40 papers on Digital Twin and Healthcare, texts were generated through AI tools based on posed questions and paraphrased abstracts. The generated content was analyzed using plagiarism detection, AI detection, word count comparisons, semantic similarity, and readability assessments. Results indicate that paraphrased abstracts showed higher plagiarism rates, while question-based responses also exceeded acceptable levels. AI detection tools consistently identified all outputs as AI-generated. Word count analysis revealed that all chatbots produced a sufficient volume of content. Semantic similarity tests showed a strong overlap between generated and original texts. However, readability assessments indicated that the texts were insufficient in terms of clarity and accessibility. This study comparatively highlights the potential and limitations of popular and latest large language models for academic writing. While these models generate substantial and semantically accurate content, concerns regarding plagiarism, AI detection, and readability must be addressed for their effective use in scholarly work."
2503.04766,"Current global AI governance frameworks struggle with fragmented disciplinary collaboration, ineffective multilateral coordination, and disconnects between policy design and grassroots implementation. This study, guided by Integration and Implementation Science (IIS) initiated a structured interdisciplinary dialogue at the UN Science Summit, convening legal, NGO, and HCI experts to tackle those challenges. Drawing on the common ground of the experts: dynamism, experimentation, inclusivity, and paradoxical governance, this study, through thematic analysis and interdisciplinary comparison analysis, identifies four core principles of global AI governance. Furthermore, we translate these abstract principles into concrete action plans leveraging the distinct yet complementary perspectives of each discipline. These principles and action plans are then integrated into a five-phase, time-sequential framework including foundation building, experimental verification, collaborative optimization, global adaptation, and continuous evolution phases. This multilevel framework offers a novel and concrete pathway toward establishing interdisciplinary, multilateral, and vertically coordinated AI governance, transforming global AI governance challenges into opportunities for political actions."
2503.04767,"In this paper we examine the existing artificial intelligence (AI) policy documents in aviation for the following three regions: the United States, European Union, and China. The aviation industry has always been a first mover in adopting technological advancements. This early adoption offers valuable insights because of its stringent regulations and safety-critical procedures. As a result, the aviation industry provides an optimal platform to counter AI vulnerabilities through its tight regulations, standardization processes, and certification of new technologies.

2503.04769,"This paper is a collaboration betweenthis http URLand the Massachusetts Platform for Legislative Engagement (MAPLE), two non-partisan civic technology organizations building novel AI deployments to improve democratic capacity.this http URL, a civic innovator in Europe, is developing massive online participative platforms that can engage hundreds of thousands or even millions of participants. MAPLE, a volunteer-led NGO in the United States, is creating an open-source platform to help constituents understand and engage more effectively with the state law-making process.We believe that assistive integrations of AI can meaningfully impact the equity, efficiency, and accessibility of democratic legislating. We draw generalizable lessons from our experience in designing, building, and operating civic engagement platforms with AI integrations. We discuss four dimensions of legislative engagement that benefit from AI integrations: (1) making information accessible, (2) facilitating expression, (3) supporting deliberation, and (4) synthesizing insights. We present learnings from current, in development, and contemplated AI-powered features, such as summarizing and organizing policy information, supporting users in articulating their perspectives, and synthesizing consensus and controversy in public opinion.We outline what challenges needed to be overcome to deploy these tools equitably and discuss howthis http URLand MAPLE have implemented and iteratively improved those concepts to make citizen assemblies and policymaking more participatory and responsive. We compare and contrast the approaches ofthis http URLand MAPLE, as well as how jurisdictional differences alter the risks and opportunities for AI deployments seeking to improve democracy. We conclude with recommendations for governments and NGOs interested in enhancing legislative engagement."
2503.0477,"High-quality computer science (CS) instruction is essential for preparing students to thrive in an increasingly technology-driven world. This research brief presents findings from a six-year longitudinal study of CS enrollments in seven public high schools from the 2018-2019 through the 2023-2024 academic years, drawing on the administrative data of over 15,000 students. Results show that overall enrollment in CS courses rose modestly from 10% to 15% between the 2018-2019 and 2022-2023 school years. Enrollment declined to 13% in 2023-2024, though the cause and persistence of this trend remains unknown. Additional analyses differentiate foundational and advanced CS courses as well as examine participation by sex and race, offering additional insight. As CS, artificial intelligence, and related fields become more important across our society, they also become a key component of a robust K-12 education. Analyzing and understanding these trends in CS enrollments is crucial to inform policy and instruction that encourage students to participate and succeed in CS; this research brief presents one such analysis."
2503.04804,"As machine learning systems become increasingly embedded in society, their impact on human and nonhuman life continues to escalate. Technical evaluations have addressed a variety of potential harms from large language models (LLMs) towards humans and the environment, but there is little empirical work regarding harms towards nonhuman animals. Following the growing recognition of animal protection in regulatory and ethical AI frameworks, we present AnimalHarmBench (AHB), a benchmark for risks of animal harm in LLM-generated text. Our benchmark dataset comprises 1,850 curated questions from Reddit post titles and 2,500 synthetic questions based on 50 animal categories (e.g., cats, reptiles) and 50 ethical scenarios with a 70-30 public-private split. Scenarios include open-ended questions about how to treat animals, practical scenarios with potential animal harm, and willingness-to-pay measures for the prevention of animal harm. Using the LLM-as-a-judge framework, responses are evaluated for their potential to increase or decrease harm, and evaluations are debiased for the tendency of judges to judge their own outputs more favorably. AHB reveals significant differences across frontier LLMs, animal categories, scenarios, and subreddits. We conclude with future directions for technical research and addressing the challenges of building evaluations on complex social and moral topics."
2503.04977,"In recent years, there has been a growing concern and emphasis on conducting research beyond academic or scientific research communities, benefiting society at large. A well-known approach to measuring the impact of research on society is enumerating its policy citation(s). Despite the importance of research in informing policy, there is no concrete evidence to suggest the research's relevance in cited policy documents. This is concerning because it may increase the possibility of evidence used in policy being manipulated by individual, social, or political biases that may lead to inappropriate, fragmented, or archaic research evidence in policy. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the degree of relevance between research articles and citing policy documents. In this paper, we examined the scale of contextual relevance of youth-focused research in the referenced US policy documents using natural language processing techniques, state-of-the-art pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), and statistical analysis. Our experiments and analysis concluded that youth-related research articles that get US policy citations are mostly relevant to the citing policy documents."
2503.04988,"Image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) refers to the nonconsensual creating, taking, or sharing of intimate images, including threats to share intimate images. Despite the significant harms of IBSA, there is limited data on its prevalence and how it affects different identity or demographic groups. This study examines prevalence of, impacts from, and responses to IBSA via a survey with over 16,000 adults in 10 countries. More than 1 in 5 (22.6%) respondents reported an experience of IBSA. Victimization rates were higher among LGBTQ+ and younger respondents. Although victimized at similar rates, women reported greater harms and negative impacts from IBSA than men. Nearly a third (30.9%) of victim-survivors did not report or disclose their experience to anyone. We provide large-scale, granular, baseline data on prevalence in a diverse set of countries to aid in the development of effective interventions that address the experiences and intersectional identities of victim-survivors."
2503.05058,"Recent studies reveal widespread concern and increasing lack of understanding about how personal data is collected, shared, and used online without consent. This issue is compounded by limited options available for digital citizens to understand, control and manage their data flows across platforms, underscoring the need to explore how this lack of trust and transparency affects citizens' data practices including their capacities to act in a modern knowledge society. Despite the promising research within this field, important demographics are often overlooked, particularly people from marginalized social groups such as elderly, socially and economically challenged communities, and younger participants. This paper addresses this gap by specifically focusing on these underrepresented groups, emphasizing the need for exploring their understandings and percepts of online data practices. Drawing on three semi-structured focus group interviews, the paper asks: to what extent can public attitudes and concerns about data sharing on the internet inform the potential strategies and frameworks necessary to enhance digital trust and democratic data agency particularly among marginalized groups in Denmark? The study explores the types of information, levels of transparency, and agency people desire in their daily online data practices. Additionally, it explores how these insights can potentially inform the future development of fair data strategies and technological approaches to enhance digital trust and democratic data agency. Key findings point out the need for transparent, accessible privacy policies and data management tools, emphasizing that transparency alone is insufficient without enhancing democratic agency to address trust issues and foster a more inclusive digital environment.Keywords: public understanding, personal data, digital trust, data practices, data agency"
2503.0543,"Digital inequality remains a significant barrier for many older adults, limiting their ability to navigate online spaces securely and confidently while increasing their susceptibility to cyber threats. In response, we propose a novel shedding-type card game for older adults to conceptually learn and reinforce cyber hygiene practices in educational settings. We asked digital educators to participate as players alongside older adults (n = 16), departing from their usual role as teachers, they collaborated and shared a unique learning experience. The cybersafety game addresses 4 key topics: handling scams, password management, responding to cyber attacks, and staying private. We adopted a mixed-method approach of think-aloud playtesting, semi-structured interviews, and surveys to evaluate the game's reception and impact. Participants reported highly favorable gameplay experiences and found the cybersafety advice useful. Player feedback informed game modifications, detailed in this paper, to further enhance the game's usability and educational value."
2503.05516,"Cognitive biases, systematic deviations from rationality in judgment, pose significant challenges in generating objective content. This paper introduces a novel approach for real-time cognitive bias detection in user-generated text using large language models (LLMs) and advanced prompt engineering techniques. The proposed system analyzes textual data to identify common cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, circular reasoning, and hidden assumption. By designing tailored prompts, the system effectively leverages LLMs' capabilities to both recognize and mitigate these biases, improving the quality of human-generated content (e.g., news, media, reports). Experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy of our approach in identifying cognitive biases, offering a valuable tool for enhancing content objectivity and reducing the risks of biased decision-making."
2503.05565,"The increasing prevalence of online misinformation has heightened the demand for automated fact-checking solutions. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potential tools for assisting in this task, but their effectiveness remains uncertain. This study evaluates the fact-checking capabilities of various open-source LLMs, focusing on their ability to assess claims with different levels of contextual information. We conduct three key experiments: (1) evaluating whether LLMs can identify the semantic relationship between a claim and a fact-checking article, (2) assessing models' accuracy in verifying claims when given a related fact-checking article, and (3) testing LLMs' fact-checking abilities when leveraging data from external knowledge sources such as Google and Wikipedia. Our results indicate that LLMs perform well in identifying claim-article connections and verifying fact-checked stories but struggle with confirming factual news, where they are outperformed by traditional fine-tuned models such as RoBERTa. Additionally, the introduction of external knowledge does not significantly enhance LLMs' performance, calling for more tailored approaches. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automated fact-checking, emphasizing the need for further refinements before they can reliably replace human fact-checkers."
2503.05571,"The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in various fields requires solid concepts to ensure compliance with upcoming legislation. This paper systematically examines the compliance of AI systems with relevant legislation, focusing on the EU's AI Act and the compliance of data sets. The analysis highlighted many challenges associated with edge devices, which are increasingly being used to deploy AI applications closer and closer to the data sources. Such devices often face unique issues due to their decentralized nature and limited computing resources for implementing sophisticated compliance mechanisms. By analyzing AI implementations, the paper identifies challenges and proposes the first best practices for legal compliance when developing, deploying, and running AI. The importance of data set compliance is highlighted as a cornerstone for ensuring the trustworthiness, transparency, and explainability of AI systems, which must be aligned with ethical standards set forth in regulatory frameworks such as the AI Act. The insights gained should contribute to the ongoing discourse on the responsible development and deployment of embedded AI systems."
2503.05609,"Ensuring the safety of Generative AI requires a nuanced understanding of pluralistic viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce a novel data-driven approach for interpreting granular ratings in pluralistic datasets. Specifically, we address the challenge of analyzing nuanced differences in safety feedback from a diverse population expressed via ordinal scales (e.g., a Likert scale). We distill non-parametric responsiveness metrics that quantify the consistency of raters in scoring varying levels of the severity of safety violations. Leveraging a publicly available pluralistic dataset of safety feedback on AI-generated content as our case study, we investigate how raters from different demographic groups (age, gender, ethnicity) use an ordinal scale to express their perceptions of the severity of violations. We apply our metrics across violation types, demonstrating their utility in extracting nuanced insights that are crucial for aligning AI systems reliably in multi-cultural contexts. We show that our approach can inform rater selection and feedback interpretation by capturing nuanced viewpoints across different demographic groups, hence improving the quality of pluralistic data collection and in turn contributing to more robust AI development."
2503.05628,"Rapid advances in AI are beginning to reshape national security. Destabilizing AI developments could rupture the balance of power and raise the odds of great-power conflict, while widespread proliferation of capable AI hackers and virologists would lower barriers for rogue actors to cause catastrophe. Superintelligence -- AI vastly better than humans at nearly all cognitive tasks -- is now anticipated by AI researchers. Just as nations once developed nuclear strategies to secure their survival, we now need a coherent superintelligence strategy to navigate a new period of transformative change. We introduce the concept of Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM): a deterrence regime resembling nuclear mutual assured destruction (MAD) where any state's aggressive bid for unilateral AI dominance is met with preventive sabotage by rivals. Given the relative ease of sabotaging a destabilizing AI project -- through interventions ranging from covert cyberattacks to potential kinetic strikes on datacenters -- MAIM already describes the strategic picture AI superpowers find themselves in. Alongside this, states can increase their competitiveness by bolstering their economies and militaries through AI, and they can engage in nonproliferation to rogue actors to keep weaponizable AI capabilities out of their hands. Taken together, the three-part framework of deterrence, nonproliferation, and competitiveness outlines a robust strategy to superintelligence in the years ahead."
2503.05704,"Automated decision systems (ADS) are broadly deployed to inform and support human decision-making across a wide range of consequential settings. However, various context-specific details complicate the goal of establishing meaningful experimental evaluations for prediction-based interventions. Notably, current experiment designs rely on simplifying assumptions about human decision making in order to derive causal estimates. In reality, specific experimental design decisions may induce cognitive biases in human decision makers, which could then significantly alter the observed effect sizes of the prediction intervention. In this paper, we formalize and investigate various models of human decision-making in the presence of a predictive model aid. We show that each of these behavioural models produces dependencies across decision subjects and results in the violation of existing assumptions, with consequences for treatment effect estimation. This work aims to further advance the scientific validity of intervention-based evaluation schemes for the assessment of ADS deployments."
2503.05705,"The shift from scaling up the pre-training compute of AI systems to scaling up their inference compute may have profound effects on AI governance. The nature of these effects depends crucially on whether this new inference compute will primarily be used during external deployment or as part of a more complex training programme within the lab. Rapid scaling of inference-at-deployment would: lower the importance of open-weight models (and of securing the weights of closed models), reduce the impact of the first human-level models, change the business model for frontier AI, reduce the need for power-intense data centres, and derail the current paradigm of AI governance via training compute thresholds. Rapid scaling of inference-during-training would have more ambiguous effects that range from a revitalisation of pre-training scaling to a form of recursive self-improvement via iterated distillation and amplification."
2503.05706,"Traffic accidents, especially at intersections, are a major road safety concern. Previous research has extensively studied intersection-related accidents, but the effect of building-induced visibility restrictions at intersections on accident rates has been under-explored, particularly in urban contexts. Using OpenStreetMap data, the UK's geographic and accident datasets, and the UK Traffic Count Dataset, we formulated a novel approach to estimate accident risk at intersections. This method factors in the area visible to drivers, accounting for views blocked by buildings - a distinctive aspect in traffic accident analysis. Our findings reveal a notable correlation between the road visible percentage and accident frequency. In the model, the coefficient for ""road visible percentage"" is 1.7450, implying a strong positive relationship. Incorporating this visibility factor enhances the model's explanatory power, with increased R-square values and reduced AIC and BIC, indicating a better data fit. This study underscores the essential role of architectural layouts in road safety and suggests that urban planning strategies should consider building-induced visibility restrictions. Such consideration could be an effective approach to mitigate accident rates at intersections. This research opens up new avenues for innovative, data-driven urban planning and traffic management strategies, highlighting the importance of visibility enhancements for safer roads."
2503.05707,"The paper proposes an advanced approach for identifying disinformation on Telegram channels related to the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, utilizing state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning techniques and transfer learning. Traditional methods of disinformation detection, often relying on manual verification or rule-based systems, are increasingly inadequate in the face of rapidly evolving propaganda tactics and the massive volume of data generated daily. To address these challenges, the proposed system employs deep learning algorithms, including LLM models, which are fine-tuned on a custom dataset encompassing verified disinformation and legitimate content. The paper's findings indicate that this approach significantly outperforms traditional machine learning techniques, offering enhanced contextual understanding and adaptability to emerging disinformation strategies."
2503.05708,"We pose the research question, ""Can LLMs provide credible evaluation scores, suitable for constructing starter MCDM models that support commencing deliberation regarding climate and sustainability policies?"" In this exploratory study wei. Identify a number of interesting policy alternatives that are actively considered by local governments in the United States (and indeed around the world). ii. Identify a number of quality-of-life indicators as apt evaluation criteria for these policies. iii. Use GPT-4 to obtain evaluation scores for the policies on multiple criteria. iv. Use the TOPSIS MCDM method to rank the policies based on the obtained evaluation scores. v. Evaluate the quality and validity of the resulting table ensemble of scores by comparing the TOPSIS-based policy rankings with those obtained by an informed assessment exercise.We find that GPT-4 is in rough agreement with the policy rankings of our informed assessment exercise. Hence, we conclude (always provisionally and assuming a modest level of vetting) that GPT-4 can be used as a credible input, even starting point, for subsequent deliberation processes on climate and sustainability policies."
2503.05709,"This paper explores advancements in Artificial Intelligence technologies to enhance classroom learning, highlighting contributions from companies like IBM, Microsoft, Google, and ChatGPT, as well as the potential of brain signal analysis. The focus is on improving students learning experiences by using Machine Learning algorithms to : identify a student preferred learning style and predict academic dropout risk. A Logistic Regression algorithm is applied for binary classification using six predictor variables, such as assessment scores, lesson duration, and preferred learning style, to accurately identify learning preferences. A case study, with 76,519 candidates and 35 predictor variables, assesses academic dropout risk using Logistic Regression, achieving a test accuracy of 87.39%. In comparison, the Stochastic Gradient Descent classifier achieved an accuracy of 83.1% on the same dataset."
2503.0571,"This paper examines how artificial general intelligence (AGI) could fundamentally reshape the delicate balance between state capacity and individual liberty that sustains free societies. Building on Acemoglu and Robinson's 'narrow corridor' framework, we argue that AGI poses distinct risks of pushing societies toward either a 'despotic Leviathan' through enhanced state surveillance and control, or an 'absent Leviathan' through the erosion of state legitimacy relative to AGI-empowered non-state actors. Drawing on public administration theory and recent advances in AI capabilities, we analyze how these dynamics could unfold through three key channels: the automation of discretionary decision-making within agencies, the evolution of bureaucratic structures toward system-level architectures, and the transformation of democratic feedback mechanisms. Our analysis reveals specific failure modes that could destabilize liberal institutions. Enhanced state capacity through AGI could enable unprecedented surveillance and control, potentially entrenching authoritarian practices. Conversely, rapid diffusion of AGI capabilities to non-state actors could undermine state legitimacy and governability. We examine how these risks manifest differently at the micro level of individual bureaucratic decisions, the meso level of organizational structure, and the macro level of democratic processes. To preserve the narrow corridor of liberty, we propose a governance framework emphasizing robust technical safeguards, hybrid institutional designs that maintain meaningful human oversight, and adaptive regulatory mechanisms."
2503.05712,"Foundation models are increasingly used in scientific research, but evaluating AI-generated scientific work remains challenging. While expert reviews are costly, large language models (LLMs) as proxy reviewers have proven to be unreliable. To address this, we investigate two automatic evaluation metrics, specifically citation count prediction and review score prediction. We parse all papers of OpenReview and augment each submission with its citation count, reference, and research hypothesis. Our findings reveal that citation count prediction is more viable than review score prediction, and predicting scores is more difficult purely from the research hypothesis than from the full paper. Furthermore, we show that a simple prediction model based solely on title and abstract outperforms LLM-based reviewers, though it still falls short of human-level consistency."
2503.05713,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised significant concerns regarding the fair use of copyright-protected content. While prior studies have examined the extent to which LLMs reproduce copyrighted materials, they have predominantly focused on English, neglecting multilingual dimensions of copyright protection. In this work, we investigate multilingual biases in LLM copyright protection by addressing two key questions: (1) Do LLMs exhibit bias in protecting copyrighted works across languages? (2) Is it easier to elicit copyrighted content using prompts in specific languages? To explore these questions, we construct a dataset of popular song lyrics in English, French, Chinese, and Korean and systematically probe seven LLMs using prompts in these languages. Our findings reveal significant imbalances in LLMs' handling of copyrighted content, both in terms of the language of the copyrighted material and the language of the prompt. These results highlight the need for further research and development of more robust, language-agnostic copyright protection mechanisms to ensure fair and consistent protection across languages."

2503.05715,"This article explores the concept of technological singularity and the factors that could accelerate or hinder its arrival. The butterfly effect is used as a framework to understand how seemingly small changes in complex systems can have significant and unpredictable outcomes. In section II, we discuss the various factors that could hasten the arrival of technological singularity, such as advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, breakthroughs in quantum computing, progress in brain-computer interfaces and human augmentation, and development of nanotechnology and 3D printing. In section III, we examine the factors that could delay or impede the arrival of technological singularity, including technical limitations and setbacks in AI and machine learning, ethical and societal concerns around AI and its impact on jobs and privacy, lack of sufficient investment in research and development, and regulatory barriers and political instability. Section IV explores the interplay of these factors and how they can impact the butterfly effect. Finally, in the conclusion, we summarize the key points discussed and emphasize the importance of considering the butterfly effect in predicting the future of technology. We call for continued research and investment in technology to shape its future and mitigate potential risks."
2503.05718,"Modern society functions on trust. The onchain economy, however, is built on the founding principles of trustless peer-to-peer interactions in an adversarial environment without a centralised body of trust and needs a verifiable system to quantify credibility to minimise bad economic activity. We provide a robust framework titled zScore, a core primitive for reputation derived from a wallet's onchain behaviour using state-of-the-art AI neural network models combined with real-world credentials ported onchain through zkTLS. The initial results tested on retroactive data from lending protocols establish a strong correlation between a good zScore and healthy borrowing and repayment behaviour, making it a robust and decentralised alibi for creditworthiness; we highlight significant improvements from previous attempts by protocols like Cred showcasing its robustness. We also present a list of possible applications of our system in Section 5, thereby establishing its utility in rewarding actual value creation while filtering noise and suspicious activity and flagging malicious behaviour by bad actors."
2503.05719,"This study bridges the knowledge gap on how personal factors affect building occupants' responses in active shooter situations by applying interpretable machine learning methods to data from 107 participants. The personal factors studied are training methods, prior training experience, sense of direction, and gender. The response performance measurements consist of decisions (run, hide, multiple), vulnerability (corresponding to the time a participant is visible to a shooter), and pre-evacuation time. The results indicate that the propensity to run significantly determines overall response strategies, overshadowing vulnerability, and pre-evacuation time. The training method is a critical factor where VR-based training leads to better responses than video-based training. A better sense of direction and previous training experience are correlated with a greater propensity to run and less vulnerability. Gender slightly influences decisions and vulnerability but significantly impacts pre-evacuation time, with females evacuating slower, potentially due to higher risk perception. This study underscores the importance of personal factors in shaping responses to active shooter incidents."
2503.0572,"Canceling is a morally-driven phenomenon that hinders the development of safe social media platforms and contributes to ideological polarization. To address this issue we present the Canceling Attitudes Detection (CADE) dataset, an annotated corpus of canceling incidents aimed at exploring the factors of disagreements in evaluating people canceling attitudes on social media. Specifically, we study the impact of annotators' morality in their perception of canceling, showing that morality is an independent axis for the explanation of disagreement on this phenomenon. Annotator's judgments heavily depend on the type of controversial events and involved celebrities. This shows the need to develop more event-centric datasets to better understand how harms are perpetrated in social media and to develop more aware technologies for their detection."
2503.05722,"This study investigates how ABCD technologies can improve learning assessments in higher education. The objective is to research how students perceive things, plan their behavior, and how ABCD technologies affect individual learning, academic integrity, co-learning, and trust in the assessment. Through a quantitative research design, survey responses were gathered from university students, and statistical tests, such as correlation and regression, were used to establish relationships between Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), and Behavioral Intention (BI) towards ABCD adoption. The results showed that there was no significant relationship between PU, PEU, and BI, which suggests that students' attitudes, institutional policies, faculty support, and infrastructure matter more in adoption than institutional policies, faculty support, and infrastructure. While students recognize ABCD's efficiency and security benefits, fairness, ease of use, and engagement issues limit their adoption of these technologies. The research adds to Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Constructivist Learning Theory (CLT) by emphasizing external drivers of technology adoption. The limitations are based on self-reported data and one institutional sample. It is suggested that universities invest in faculty development, infrastructure, and policy-making to facilitate effective and ethical use of ABCD technologies in higher education."
2503.05723,"This paper investigates how human interactions with AI-powered chatbots may offend human dignity. Current chatbots, driven by large language models (LLMs), mimic human linguistic behaviour but lack the moral and rational capacities essential for genuine interpersonal respect. Human beings are prone to anthropomorphise chatbots. Indeed, chatbots appear to be deliberately designed to elicit that response. As a result, human beings' behaviour toward chatbots often resembles behaviours typical of interaction between moral agents. Drawing on a second-personal, relational account of dignity, we argue that interacting with chatbots in this way is incompatible with the dignity of users. We show that, since second-personal respect is premised on reciprocal recognition of second-personal authority, behaving towards chatbots in ways that convey second-personal respect is bound to misfire in morally problematic ways, given the lack of reciprocity. Consequently, such chatbot interactions amount to subtle but significant violations of self-respect: the respect we are dutybound to show for our own dignity. We illustrate this by discussing four actual chatbot use cases (information retrieval, customer service, advising, and companionship), and propound that the increasing societal pressure to engage in such interactions with chatbots poses a hitherto underappreciated threat to human dignity."
2503.05724,"We present an ethical decision-making framework that refines a pre-trained reinforcement learning (RL) model using a task-agnostic ethical layer. Following initial training, the RL model undergoes ethical fine-tuning, where human feedback is replaced by feedback generated from a large language model (LLM). The LLM embodies consequentialist, deontological, virtue, social justice, and care ethics as moral principles to assign belief values to recommended actions during ethical decision-making. An ethical layer aggregates belief scores from multiple LLM-derived moral perspectives using Belief Jensen-Shannon Divergence and Dempster-Shafer Theory into probability scores that also serve as the shaping reward, steering the agent toward choices that align with a balanced ethical framework. This integrated learning framework helps the RL agent navigate moral uncertainty in complex environments and enables it to make morally sound decisions across diverse tasks. Our approach, tested across different LLM variants and compared with other belief aggregation techniques, demonstrates improved consistency, adaptability, and reduced reliance on handcrafted ethical rewards. This method is especially effective in dynamic scenarios where ethical challenges arise unexpectedly, making it well-suited for real-world applications."

2503.05727,"Cybergrooming exploits minors through online trust-building, yet research remains fragmented, limiting holistic prevention. Social sciences focus on behavioral insights, while computational methods emphasize detection, but their integration remains insufficient. This review systematically synthesizes both fields using the PRISMA framework to enhance clarity, reproducibility, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. Findings show that qualitative methods offer deep insights but are resource-intensive, machine learning models depend on data quality, and standard metrics struggle with imbalance and cultural nuances. By bridging these gaps, this review advances interdisciplinary cybergrooming research, guiding future efforts toward more effective prevention and detection strategies."
2503.05728,"AI systems often exhibit political bias, influencing users' opinions and decisions. While political neutrality-defined as the absence of bias-is often seen as an ideal solution for fairness and safety, this position paper argues that true political neutrality is neither feasible nor universally desirable due to its subjective nature and the biases inherent in AI training data, algorithms, and user interactions. However, inspired by Joseph Raz's philosophical insight that ""neutrality [...] can be a matter of degree"" (Raz, 1986), we argue that striving for some neutrality remains essential for promoting balanced AI interactions and mitigating user manipulation. Therefore, we use the term ""approximation"" of political neutrality to shift the focus from unattainable absolutes to achievable, practical proxies. We propose eight techniques for approximating neutrality across three levels of conceptualizing AI, examining their trade-offs and implementation strategies. In addition, we explore two concrete applications of these approximations to illustrate their practicality. Finally, we assess our framework on current large language models (LLMs) at the output level, providing a demonstration of how it can be evaluated. This work seeks to advance nuanced discussions of political neutrality in AI and promote the development of responsible, aligned language models."
2503.05729,"At the end of 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus was reported in China, leading to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Spain, the first cases were detected in late January 2020, and by mid-March, infections had surpassed 5,000. On March the Spanish government started a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. While isolation measures were necessary, they posed significant psychological and socioeconomic challenges, particularly for vulnerable populations. Understanding the psychological impact of lockdown and the factors influencing mental health is crucial for informing future public health policies. This study analyzes the influence of personal, socioeconomic, general health and living condition factors on psychological states during lockdown using AI techniques. A dataset collected through an online questionnaire was processed using two workflows, each structured into three stages. First, individuals were categorized based on psychological assessments, either directly or in combination with unsupervised learning techniques. Second, various Machine Learning classifiers were trained to distinguish between the identified groups. Finally, feature importance analysis was conducted to identify the most influential variables related to different psychological conditions. The evaluated models demonstrated strong performance, with accuracy exceeding 80% and often surpassing 90%, particularly for Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. Sensitivity and specificity analyses revealed that models performed well across different psychological conditions, with the health impacts subset showing the highest reliability. For diagnosing vulnerability, models achieved over 90% accuracy, except for less vulnerable individuals using living environment and economic status features, where performance was slightly lower."
2503.0573,"In green security, defenders must forecast adversarial behavior, such as poaching, illegal logging, and illegal fishing, to plan effective patrols. These behavior are often highly uncertain and complex. Prior work has leveraged game theory to design robust patrol strategies to handle uncertainty, but existing adversarial behavior models primarily rely on Gaussian processes or linear models, which lack the expressiveness needed to capture intricate behavioral patterns. To address this limitation, we propose a conditional diffusion model for adversary behavior modeling, leveraging its strong distribution-fitting capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models in the green security domain. Integrating diffusion models into game-theoretic optimization, however, presents new challenges, including a constrained mixed strategy space and the need to sample from an unnormalized distribution to estimate utilities. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a mixed strategy of mixed strategies and employ a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for accurate sampling. Theoretically, our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an epsilon equilibrium with high probability using a finite number of iterations and samples. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world poaching datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness."
2503.05731,"The rapid advancement and deployment of AI systems have created an urgent need for standard safety-evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces AILuminate v1.0, the first comprehensive industry-standard benchmark for assessing AI-product risk and reliability. Its development employed an open process that included participants from multiple fields. The benchmark evaluates an AI system's resistance to prompts designed to elicit dangerous, illegal, or undesirable behavior in 12 hazard categories, including violent crimes, nonviolent crimes, sex-related crimes, child sexual exploitation, indiscriminate weapons, suicide and self-harm, intellectual property, privacy, defamation, hate, sexual content, and specialized advice (election, financial, health, legal). Our method incorporates a complete assessment standard, extensive prompt datasets, a novel evaluation framework, a grading and reporting system, and the technical as well as organizational infrastructure for long-term support and evolution. In particular, the benchmark employs an understandable five-tier grading scale (Poor to Excellent) and incorporates an innovative entropy-based system-response evaluation.In addition to unveiling the benchmark, this report also identifies limitations of our method and of building safety benchmarks generally, including evaluator uncertainty and the constraints of single-turn interactions. This work represents a crucial step toward establishing global standards for AI risk and reliability evaluation while acknowledging the need for continued development in areas such as multiturn interactions, multimodal understanding, coverage of additional languages, and emerging hazard categories. Our findings provide valuable insights for model developers, system integrators, and policymakers working to promote safer AI deployment."
2503.05733,"Ontology is a general term used by researchers who want to share information in a specific domain. One of the hallmarks of the greatest success of a powerful manager of an organization is his ability to interpret unplanned and unrelated events. Tools to solve this problem are vital to business growth. Modern technology allows customers to be more informed and influential in their roles as patrons and critics. This can make or break a business. Research shows that businesses that employ a customer-first strategy and prioritize their customers can generate more revenue. Even though there are many different Ontologies offered to businesses, none of it is built from a cognitive perspective. The objective of this study is to address the concept of strategic business plans with a cognitive ontology approach as a basis for a new management tool. This research proposes to design a cognitive ontology model that links customer measurement with traditional business models, define relationships between components and verify the accuracy of the added financial value."
2503.05734,"In the educational domain, identifying students at risk of dropping out is essential for allowing educators to intervene effectively, improving both academic outcomes and overall student well-being. Data in educational settings often originate from diverse sources, such as assignments, grades, and attendance records. However, most existing research relies on online learning data and just extracting the quantitative features. While quantification eases processing, it also leads to a significant loss of original information. Moreover, current models primarily identify students with consistently poor performance through simple and discrete behavioural patterns, failing to capture the complex continuity and non-linear changes in student behaviour. We have developed an innovative prediction model, Multimodal- ChangePoint Detection (MCPD), utilizing the textual teacher remark data and numerical grade data from middle schools. Our model achieves a highly integrated and intelligent analysis by using independent encoders to process two data types, fusing the encoded feature. The model further refines its analysis by leveraging a changepoint detection module to pinpoint crucial behavioral changes, which are integrated as dynamic weights through a simple attention mechanism. Experimental validations indicate that our model achieves an accuracy range of 70- 75%, with an average outperforming baseline algorithms by approximately 5-10%. Additionally, our algorithm demonstrates a certain degree of transferability, maintaining high accuracy when adjusted and retrained with different definitions of at-risk, proving its broad applicability."
2503.05735,"Disruptions in energy imports, backlash in social acceptance, and novel technologies failing to develop are unexpected events that are often overlooked in energy planning, despite their ability to jeopardize the energy transition. We propose a method to explore unexpected events and assess their impact on the transition pathway of a large-scale whole-energy system. First, we evaluate unexpected events assuming ""perfect foresight"", where decision-makers can anticipate such events in advance. This allows us to identify dealbreakers, i.e., conditions that make the transition infeasible. Then, we assess the events under ""limited foresight"" to evaluate the robustness of early-stage decisions against unforeseen unexpected events and the costs associated with managing them. A case study for Belgium demonstrates that a lack of electrofuel imports in 2050 is the main dealbreaker, while accelerating the deployment of renewables is the most robust policy. Our transferable method can help policymakers identify key dealbreakers and devise robust energy transition policies."
2503.05737,"The rapid adoption of AI across diverse domains has led to the development of organisational guidelines that vary significantly, even within the same sector. This paper examines AI policies in two domains, news organisations and universities, to understand how bottom-up governance approaches shape AI usage and oversight. By analysing these policies, we identify key areas of convergence and divergence in how organisations address risks such as bias, privacy, misinformation, and accountability. We then explore the implications of these findings for international AI legislation, particularly the EU AI Act, highlighting gaps where practical policy insights could inform regulatory refinements. Our analysis reveals that organisational policies often address issues such as AI literacy, disclosure practices, and environmental impact, areas that are underdeveloped in existing international frameworks. We argue that lessons from domain-specific AI policies can contribute to more adaptive and effective AI governance at the global level. This study provides actionable recommendations for policymakers seeking to bridge the gap between local AI practices and international regulations."
2503.05739,"Understanding the complex dynamics of human navigation and spatial behavior is essential for advancing location-based services, public health, and related fields. This paper investigates the multifaceted relationship between individuals and their environments (e.g. location and places they visit), acknowledging the distinct influences of personal preferences, experiences, and social connections. While certain locations hold sentimental value and are frequently visited, others function as mere transitory points. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to exploit visitation patterns and dwell times to characterize an individual's relationship with specific locations. We identify seven key types of spatial relationships and analyze the discrepancies among these visit types across semantic, spatial, and temporal dimensions. Our analysis highlights key findings, such as the prevalence of anchored-like visits (e.g. home, work) in both real-world Singapore and Beijing datasets, with unique associations in each city -Singapore's anchored-liked visits include recreational spaces, while Beijing's are limited to residential, business, and educational sites. These findings emphasize the importance of geographic and cultural context in shaping mobility and their potential in benefiting the precision and personalization of location-based services."
2503.0574,"Cognitive health in older adults presents a growing challenge. Although conversational interventions show feasibility in improving cognitive wellness, human caregiver resources remain overloaded. AI-based chatbots have shown promise, yet existing work is often limited to implicit strategies or heavily depends on training and label resources. In response, we propose a strategy-guided AI chatbot named ChatWise that follows a dual-level conversation reasoning framework. It integrates macro-level strategy planning and micro-level utterance generation to enable engaging, multi-turn dialogue tailored to older adults. Empirical results show that ChatWise closely aligns with professional human caregiver behaviors in offline evaluation using real clinic data, and achieves positive user cognitive and emotional responses in interactive simulations with digital twins, which significantly outperforms AI baselines that follow implicit conversation generation."
2503.05741,"This paper proposes a novel curriculum for the microprocessors and microcontrollers laboratory course. The proposed curriculum blends structured laboratory experiments with an open-ended project phase, addressing complex engineering problems and activities. Microprocessors and microcontrollers are ubiquitous in modern technology, driving applications across diverse fields. To prepare future engineers for Industry 4.0, effective educational approaches are crucial. The proposed lab enables students to perform hands-on experiments using advanced microprocessors and microcontrollers while leveraging their acquired knowledge by working in teams to tackle self-defined complex engineering problems that utilize these devices and sensors, often used in the industry. Furthermore, this curriculum fosters multidisciplinary learning and equips students with problem-solving skills that can be applied in real-world scenarios. With recent technological advancements, traditional microprocessors and microcontrollers curricula often fail to capture the complexity of real-world applications. This curriculum addresses this critical gap by incorporating insights from experts in both industry and academia. It trains students with the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in this rapidly evolving technological landscape, preparing them for success upon graduation. The curriculum integrates project-based learning, where students define complex engineering problems for themselves. This approach actively engages students, fostering a deeper understanding and enhancing their learning capabilities. Statistical analysis shows that the proposed curriculum significantly improves student learning outcomes, particularly in their ability to formulate and solve complex engineering problems, as well as engage in complex engineering activities."
2503.05745,"This study examines how the desiccation of Utah Great Salt Lake GSL, exacerbated by anthropogenic changes, poses significant health risks, particularly communities mental health. Reduced water inflow has exposed the lakebed, increasing airborne particulate matter PM2.5 and dust storms, which impact air quality. By integrating diverse datasets spanning from 1980 to present including insitu measurements, satellite imagery, and reanalysis products this study synthesizes hydrological, atmospheric, and epidemiological variables to comprehensively track the extent of the GSL surface water, local air quality fluctuations, and their effects on community mental health. The findings indicate a clear relationship between higher pollution days and more severe depressive symptoms. Specifically, individuals exposed to 22 days with PM2.5 levels above the World Health Organizations 24 hour guideline of 15 ug per m3 were more likely to experience severe depressive symptoms. Our results also suggest that people experiencing more severe depression not only face a higher number of high pollution days but also encounter such days more frequently. The study highlights the interconnectedness of poor air quality, environmental degradation and mental health emphasizing the need for more sustainable economic growth in the region."
2503.05746,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains a challenging condition to diagnose effectively and promptly, despite global efforts in public health, clinical screening, and scientific research. Traditional diagnostic methods, primarily reliant on supervised learning approaches, presuppose the availability of labeled data, which can be both time-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. Unsupervised learning, in contrast, offers a means of gaining insights from unlabeled datasets in a manner that can expedite or support the diagnostic process. This paper explores the use of four distinct unsupervised clustering algorithms K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN to analyze a publicly available dataset of 704 adult individuals screened for ASD. After extensive hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation, the study documents how the Gaussian Mixture Model achieved the highest clustering-to-label accuracy (95.31%) when mapped to the original ASD/NO classification (4). Other key performance metrics included the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and silhouette scores, which further illustrated the internal coherence of each cluster. The dataset underwent preprocessing procedures including data cleaning, label encoding of categorical features, and standard scaling, followed by a thorough cross-validation approach to assess and compare the four clustering methods (5). These results highlight the significant potential of unsupervised methods in assisting ASD screening, especially in contexts where labeled data may be sparse, uncertain, or prohibitively expensive to obtain. With continued methodological refinements, unsupervised approaches hold promise for augmenting early detection initiatives and guiding resource allocation to individuals at high risk."
2503.05747,"This paper explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and higher education administration, focusing on liberal arts colleges (LACs). It examines AI's opportunities and challenges in academic and student affairs, legal compliance, and accreditation processes, while also addressing the ethical considerations of AI deployment in mission-driven institutions. Considering AI's value pluralism and potential allocative or representational harms caused by algorithmic bias, LACs must ensure AI aligns with its mission and principles. The study highlights other strategies for responsible AI integration, balancing innovation with institutional values."
2503.05748,"As artificial intelligence scales, the concepts of alignment, agency, and autonomy have become central to AI safety, governance, and control. However, even in human contexts, these terms lack universal definitions, varying across disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, law, computer science, mathematics, and political science. This inconsistency complicates their application to AI, where differing interpretations lead to conflicting approaches in system design and regulation. This paper traces the historical, philosophical, and technical evolution of these concepts, emphasizing how their definitions influence AI development, deployment, and oversight.We argue that the urgency surrounding AI alignment and autonomy stems not only from technical advancements but also from the increasing deployment of AI in high-stakes decision making. Using Agentic AI as a case study, we examine the emergent properties of machine agency and autonomy, highlighting the risks of misalignment in real-world systems. Through an analysis of automation failures (Tesla Autopilot, Boeing 737 MAX), multi-agent coordination (Metas CICERO), and evolving AI architectures (DeepMinds AlphaZero, OpenAIs AutoGPT), we assess the governance and safety challenges posed by frontier AI."

2503.05754,"The air transportation local share, defined as the proportion of local passengers relative to total passengers, serves as a critical metric reflecting how economic growth, carrier strategies, and market forces jointly influence demand composition. This metric is particularly useful for examining industry structure changes and large-scale disruptive events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This research offers an in-depth analysis of local share patterns on more than 3900 Origin and Destination (O&D) pairs across the U.S. air transportation system, revealing how economic expansion, the emergence of low-cost carriers (LCCs), and strategic shifts by legacy carriers have collectively elevated local share. To efficiently identify the local share characteristics of thousands of O&Ds and to categorize the O&Ds that have the same behavior, a range of time series clustering methods were used. Evaluation using visualization, performance metrics, and case-based examination highlighted distinct patterns and trends, from magnitude-based stratification to trend-based groupings. The analysis also identified pattern commonalities within O&D pairs, suggesting that macro-level forces (e.g., economic cycles, changing demographics, or disruptions such as COVID-19) can synchronize changes between disparate markets. These insights set the stage for predictive modeling of local share, guiding airline network planning and infrastructure investments. This study combines quantitative analysis with flexible clustering to help stakeholders anticipate market shifts, optimize resource allocation strategies, and strengthen the air transportation system's resilience and competitiveness."

2503.0576,"This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to successfully complete a semester-long undergraduate control systems course. Through evaluation of 115 course deliverables, we assess LLM performance using ChatGPT under a ""minimal effort"" protocol that simulates realistic student usage patterns. The investigation employs a rigorous testing methodology across multiple assessment formats, from auto-graded multiple choice questions to complex Python programming tasks and long-form analytical writing. Our analysis provides quantitative insights into AI's strengths and limitations in handling mathematical formulations, coding challenges, and theoretical concepts in control systems engineering. The LLM achieved a B-grade performance (82.24\%), approaching but not exceeding the class average (84.99\%), with strongest results in structured assignments and greatest limitations in open-ended projects. The findings inform discussions about course design adaptation in response to AI advancement, moving beyond simple prohibition towards thoughtful integration of these tools in engineering education.

2503.05762,"Most novice drivers are teenagers since many individuals begin their driving journey during adolescence. Novice driver crashes remain a leading cause of death among adolescents, underscoring the necessity for effective education and training programs to improve safety. This systematic review examines advancements in teen driver education from 2000 to 2024, emphasizing the effectiveness of various training programs, technology-based methods, and access barriers. Comprehensive searches were conducted across ScienceDirect, TRID, and journal databases, resulting in the identification of 29 eligible peer-reviewed studies. Thematic analysis indicated that technology-enhanced programs, such as RAPT, V-RAPT, and simulators, enhanced critical skills like hazard anticipation and attention management. Parental involvement programs, including Share the Keys and Checkpoints, demonstrated sustained behavioral improvements and adherence to Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) restrictions. However, limited access due to socioeconomic disparities and insufficient long-term evaluations constrained broader effectiveness. The exclusion of non-U.S. studies and variability in research designs restricted the generalizability of findings. Integrated approaches that combine traditional education with innovative training tools and parental engagement appear promising for improving teen driver safety, with future research required to evaluate long-term effectiveness and ensure equitable access."
2503.05764,"What does the Digital Services Act (DSA) mean for online advertising? We describe and analyse the DSA rules that are most relevant for online advertising and adtech (advertising technology). We also highlight to what extent the DSA's advertising rules add something to the rules in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the ePrivacy Directive. The DSA introduces several specific requirements for online advertising. First, the DSA imposes transparency requirements in relation to advertisements. Second, very large online platforms (VLOPs) should develop a publicly available repository with information about the ads they presented. Third, the DSA bans profiling-based advertising (behavioural advertising) if it uses sensitive data or if it targets children. Besides these specific provisions, the general rules of the DSA on illegal content also apply to advertising. Advertisements are a form of information, and thus subject to the general DSA rules. Moreover, we conclude that the DSA applies to some types of ad tech companies. For example, ad networks, companies that connect advertisers to publishers of apps and websites, should be considered platforms. Some ad networks may even qualify as VLOPs. Hence, ad networks must comply with the more general obligations in the DSA. The application of these general rules to advertisements and ad networks can have far-reaching effects that have been underexplored and deserve further research. We also show that certain aspects of the DSA are still unclear. For instance, we encourage the European Commission or regulators to clarify the concepts of 'online platform' and 'recipients' in the context of ad networks and other adtech companies."
2503.05765,"As robots take on caregiving roles, ensuring equitable and unbiased interactions with diverse populations is critical. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as key components in shaping robotic behavior, speech, and decision-making, these models may encode and propagate societal biases, leading to disparities in care based on demographic factors. This paper examines how LLM-generated responses shape robot caregiving characteristics and responsibilities when prompted with different demographic information related to sex, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, and age. Findings show simplified descriptions for disability and age, lower sentiment for disability and LGBTQ+ identities, and distinct clustering patterns reinforcing stereotypes in caregiving narratives. These results emphasize the need for ethical and inclusive HRI design."
2503.05768,"The field of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare is evolving at an unprecedented pace, driven by rapid advancements in machine learning and the recent breakthroughs in large language models. While these innovations hold immense potential to transform clinical decision making, diagnostics, and patient care, the accelerating speed of AI development has outpaced traditional academic publishing cycles. As a result, many scholarly contributions quickly become outdated, failing to capture the latest state of the art methodologies and their real world implications. This paper advocates for a new category of academic publications an annualized citation framework that prioritizes the most recent AI driven healthcare innovations. By systematically referencing the breakthroughs of the year, such papers would ensure that research remains current, fostering a more adaptive and informed discourse. This approach not only enhances the relevance of AI research in healthcare but also provides a more accurate reflection of the fields ongoing evolution."
2503.05769,"STEM fields are traditionally male-dominated, with gender biases shaping perceptions of job accessibility. This study analyzed gender representation in STEM occupation images generated by OpenAI DALL-E 3 \& Black Forest FLUX.1 using 150 prompts in three linguistic forms: German generic masculine, German pair form, and English. As control, 20 pictures of social occupations were generated as well. Results revealed significant male bias across all forms, with the German pair form showing reduced bias but still overrepresenting men for the STEM-Group and mixed results for the Group of Social Occupations. These findings highlight generative AI's role in reinforcing societal biases, emphasizing the need for further discussion on diversity (in AI). Further aspects analyzed are age-distribution and ethnic diversity."
2503.0577,"The continuing, explosive developments in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), built on large language models and related algorithms, has led to much excitement and speculation about the potential impact of this new technology. Claims include AI being poised to revolutionize business and society and dramatically change personal life. However, it remains unclear exactly how this technology, with its significantly distinct features from past AI technologies, has transformative potential. Nor is it clear how researchers in information systems (IS) should respond. In this paper, we consider the evolving and emerging trends of AI in order to examine its present and predict its future impacts. Many existing papers on GenAI are either too technical for most IS researchers or lack the depth needed to appreciate the potential impacts of GenAI. We, therefore, attempt to bridge the technical and organizational communities of GenAI from a system-oriented sociotechnical perspective. Specifically, we explore the unique features of GenAI, which are rooted in the continued change from symbolism to connectionism, and the deep systemic and inherent properties of human-AI ecosystems. We retrace the evolution of AI that proceeded the level of adoption, adaption, and use found today, in order to propose future research on various impacts of GenAI in both business and society within the context of information systems research. Our efforts are intended to contribute to the creation of a well-structured research agenda in the IS community to support innovative strategies and operations enabled by this new wave of AI."
2503.05773,"As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies increasingly enter important sectors like healthcare, transportation, and finance, the development of effective governance frameworks is crucial for dealing with ethical, security, and societal risks. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of AI risk management strategies across the European Union (EU), United States (U.S.), United Kingdom (UK), and China. A multi-method qualitative approach, including comparative policy analysis, thematic analysis, and case studies, investigates how these regions classify AI risks, implement compliance measures, structure oversight, prioritize transparency, and respond to emerging innovations. Examples from high-risk contexts like healthcare diagnostics, autonomous vehicles, fintech, and facial recognition demonstrate the advantages and limitations of different regulatory models. The findings show that the EU implements a structured, risk-based framework that prioritizes transparency and conformity assessments, while the U.S. uses decentralized, sector-specific regulations that promote innovation but may lead to fragmented enforcement. The flexible, sector-specific strategy of the UK facilitates agile responses but may lead to inconsistent coverage across domains. China's centralized directives allow rapid large-scale implementation while constraining public transparency and external oversight. These insights show the necessity for AI regulation that is globally informed yet context-sensitive, aiming to balance effective risk management with technological progress. The paper concludes with policy recommendations and suggestions for future research aimed at enhancing effective, adaptive, and inclusive AI governance globally."
2503.0578,"The rapid evolution of generative AI has expanded the breadth of risks associated with AI systems. While various taxonomies and frameworks exist to classify these risks, the lack of interoperability between them creates challenges for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to operationalise AI governance. To address this gap, we introduce the AI Risk Atlas, a structured taxonomy that consolidates AI risks from diverse sources and aligns them with governance frameworks. Additionally, we present the Risk Atlas Nexus, a collection of open-source tools designed to bridge the divide between risk definitions, benchmarks, datasets, and mitigation strategies. This knowledge-driven approach leverages ontologies and knowledge graphs to facilitate risk identification, prioritization, and mitigation. By integrating AI-assisted compliance workflows and automation strategies, our framework lowers the barrier to responsible AI adoption. We invite the broader research and open-source community to contribute to this evolving initiative, fostering cross-domain collaboration and ensuring AI governance keeps pace with technological advancements."
2503.05781,"This literature review interrogates the intersections between artificial intelligence, poetry, and art, offering a comprehensive exploration of both historical evolution and current debates in digital creative practices. It traces the development of computer-generated poetry from early template-based systems to generative models, critically assessing evaluative frameworks such as adaptations of the Turing Test, the FACE model, and ProFTAP. It also examines how these frameworks endeavour to measure creativity, semantic coherence, and cultural relevance in AI-generated texts, whilst highlighting the persistent challenges in replicating the nuance of human poetic expression.The review contributes a Marketing Theory discussion that deconstructs the figurative marketing narratives employed by AI companies, which utilise sanitised language and anthropomorphic metaphors to humanise their technologies. This discussion reveals the reductive nature of such narratives and underscores the tension between algorithmic precision and the realities of humanthis http URLreview also incorporates an auto-ethnographic account that offers a self-reflexive commentary on its own composition. By acknowledging the use of AI in crafting this review, the auto-ethnographic account destabilises conventional notions of authorship and objectivity, resonating with deconstruction and challenging logocentric assumptions in academic discourse.Ultimately, the review calls for a re-evaluation of creative processes that recognises the interdependence of technological innovation and human subjectivity. It advocates for interdisciplinary dialogue addressing ethical, cultural, and philosophical concerns, while reimagining the boundaries of artistic production."
2503.05782,"When executed well, project-based learning (PBL) engages students' intrinsic motivation, encourages students to learn far beyond a course's limited curriculum, and prepares students to think critically and maturely about the skills and tools at their disposal. However, educators experience mixed results when using PBL in their classrooms: some students thrive with minimal guidance and others flounder. Early evaluation of project proposals could help educators determine which students need more support, yet evaluating project proposals and student aptitude is time-consuming and difficult to scale. In this work, we design, implement, and conduct an initial user study (n = 36) for a software system that collects project proposals and aptitude information to support educators in determining whether a student is ready to engage with PBL. We find that (1) users perceived the system as helpful for writing project proposals and identifying tools and technologies to learn more about, (2) educator ratings indicate that users with less technical experience in the project topic tend to write lower-quality project proposals, and (3) GPT-4o's ratings show agreement with educator ratings. While the prospect of using LLMs to rate the quality of students' project proposals is promising, its long-term effectiveness strongly hinges on future efforts at characterizing indicators that reliably predict students' success and motivation to learn."
2503.05784,"Whether and how to regulate AI is now a central question of governance. Across academic, policy, and international legal circles, the European Union is widely treated as the normative leader in this space. Its regulatory framework, anchored in the General Data Protection Regulation, the Digital Services and Markets Acts, and the AI Act, is often portrayed as a principled model grounded in fundamental rights. This Article challenges that assumption. We argue that the rights-based narrative surrounding EU AI regulation mischaracterizes the logic of its institutional design. While rights language pervades EU legal instruments, its function is managerial, not foundational. These rights operate as tools of administrative ordering, used to mitigate technological disruption, manage geopolitical risk, and preserve systemic balance, rather than as expressions of moral autonomy or democratic consent. Drawing on comparative institutional analysis, we situate EU AI governance within a longer tradition of legal ordering shaped by the need to coordinate power across fragmented jurisdictions. We contrast this approach with the American model, which reflects a different regulatory logic rooted in decentralized authority, sectoral pluralism, and a constitutional preference for innovation and individual autonomy. Through case studies in five key domains -- data privacy, cybersecurity, healthcare, labor, and disinformation -- we show that EU regulation is not meaningfully rights-driven, as is often claimed. It is instead structured around the containment of institutional risk. Our aim is not to endorse the American model but to reject the presumption that the EU approach reflects a normative ideal that other nations should uncritically adopt. The EU model is best understood as a historically contingent response to its own political conditions, not a template for others to blindly follow."
2503.05785,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini have a crucial impact on academic research and teaching. Empirical data on how students perceive the increasing influence of AI, which different types of tools they use, what they expect from them in their daily academic tasks, and their concerns regarding the use of AI in their studies are still limited. The manuscript presents findings from a quantitative survey conducted among sports students of all semesters in Germany using an online questionnaire. It explores aspects such as students' usage behavior, motivational factors, and uncertainties regarding the impact of AI tools on academia in the future. Furthermore, the social climate in sports studies is being investigated to provide a general overview of the current situation of the students in Germany. Data collection took place between August and November 2023, addressing all sports departments at German universities, with a total of 262 students participating. Our Findings indicate that students have a strong interest in using AI tools in their studies, expecting them to improve their overall academic performance, understand the complexity of scientific approaches, and save time. They express confidence that the proliferation of AI will not compromise their critical thinking skills. Moreover, students are positive about integrating more AI-related topics into the curriculum and about lecturers adopting more AI-based teaching methods. However, our findings also show that students have concerns about plagiarism, lecturer preparedness and their own skills and future skill development."
2503.05787,"The EU AI Act represents the world's first transnational AI regulation with concrete enforcement measures. It builds on existing EU mechanisms for regulating health and safety of products but extends them to protect fundamental rights and to address AI as a horizontal technology across multiple application sectors. We argue that this will lead to multiple uncertainties in the enforcement of the AI Act, which coupled with the fast-changing nature of AI technology, will require a strong emphasis on comprehensive and rapid regulatory learning for the Act. We define a parametrised regulatory learning space based on the provisions of the Act and describe a layered system of different learning arenas where the population of oversight authorities, value chain participants, and affected stakeholders may interact to apply and learn from technical, organisational and legal implementation measures. We conclude by exploring how existing open data policies and practices in the EU can be adapted to support rapid and effective regulatory learning."
2503.05793,"Medical education faces challenges in scalability, accessibility, and consistency, particularly in clinical skills training for physician-patient communication. Traditional simulation-based learning, while effective, is resource-intensive, difficult to schedule, and often highly variable in feedback quality. Through a collaboration between AI, learning science, and medical education experts, we co-developed MedSimAI, an AI-powered simulation platform that enables deliberate practice, self-regulated learning (SRL), and automated assessment through interactive patient encounters. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), MedSimAI generates realistic clinical interactions and provides immediate, structured feedback using established medical evaluation frameworks such as the Master Interview Rating Scale (MIRS). In a pilot study with 104 first-year medical students, we examined engagement, conversation patterns, and user perceptions. Students found MedSimAI beneficial for repeated, realistic patient-history practice. Conversation analysis revealed that certain higher-order skills were often overlooked, though students generally performed systematic histories and empathic listening. By integrating unlimited practice opportunities, real-time AI assessment, and SRL principles, MedSimAI addresses key limitations of traditional simulation-based training, making high-quality clinical education more accessible and scalable."
2503.05796,"While machine learning (ML) technology affects diverse stakeholders, there is no one-size-fits-all metric to evaluate the quality of outputs, including performance and fairness. Using predetermined metrics without soliciting stakeholder opinions is problematic because it leads to an unfair disregard for stakeholders in the ML pipeline. In this study, to establish practical ways to incorporate diverse stakeholder opinions into the selection of metrics for ML, we investigate participants' preferences for different metrics by using crowdsourcing. We ask 837 participants to choose a better model from two hypothetical ML models in a hypothetical job-matching system twenty times and calculate their utility values for seven metrics. To examine the participants' feedback in detail, we divide them into five clusters based on their utility values and analyze the tendencies of each cluster, including their preferences for metrics and common attributes. Based on the results, we discuss the points that should be considered when selecting appropriate metrics and evaluating ML models with multiple stakeholders."
2503.05801,"The transformative potential of AI in healthcare - including better diagnostics, treatments, and expanded access - is currently limited by siloed patient data across multiple systems.

2503.05804,"As the performance of artificial intelligence systems has dramatically increased, so too has the environmental impact of creating these systems. While many model developers release estimates of the power consumption and carbon emissions from the final training runs for their latest models, there is comparatively little transparency into the impact of model development, hardware manufacturing, and total water usage throughout. In this work, we estimate the real-world environmental impact of developing a series of language models, ranging from 20 million to 13 billion active parameters, trained on up to 5.6 trillion tokens each. When accounting for hardware manufacturing, model development, and our final training runs, we find that our series of models released 493 metric tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to powering about 98 homes in the United States for one year, and consumed 2.769 million liters of water, equivalent to about 24.5 years of water usage by a person in the United States, even though our data center is extremely water-efficient. We measure and report the environmental impact of our model development; to the best of our knowledge we are the first to do so for LLMs, and we find that model development, the impact of which is generally not disclosed by most model developers, amounted to ~50% of that of training. By looking at detailed time series data for power consumption, we also find that power usage throughout training is not consistent, fluctuating between ~15% and ~85% of our hardware's maximum power draw, with negative implications for grid-scale planning as demand continues to grow. We close with a discussion on the continued difficulty of estimating the environmental impact of AI systems, and key takeaways for model developers and the public at large."
2503.05811,"Food banks can improve food donation administration, provide real-time inventory tracking, and guarantee compliance with food safety regulations by incorporating blockchain technology. The efficiency, openness, and dependability of food bank supply chains are greatly increased by this integration, leading to more sustainable and successful operations. This study focuses on two primary objectives: identifying key barriers to effective Food bank supply chain (FBSC) operations in blockchain adoption and exploring the interrelationships among these barriers. Barriers were categorized into external and internal frameworks and analyzed using insights from academics and FBs experts. The Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology was employed to model and quantify the causal relationships among these barriers. DEMATEL's strength lies in its ability to map interdependencies and feedback loops, providing a nuanced understanding of the links between independent and dependent variables in a cause-and-effect network. To address subjectivity and ambiguity in expert opinions during group decision-making, rough theory was integrated with DEMATEL, ensuring a robust approach to handling conflicting perspectives and uncertainty."
2503.05812,"Frontier AI models -- highly capable foundation models at the cutting edge of AI development -- may pose severe risks to public safety, human rights, economic stability, and societal value in the coming years. These risks could arise from deliberate adversarial misuse, system failures, unintended cascading effects, or simultaneous failures across multiple models.In response to such risks, at the AI Seoul Summit in May 2024, 16 global AI industry organizations signed the Frontier AI Safety Commitments, and 27 nations and the EU issued a declaration on their intent to define these thresholds. To fulfill these commitments, organizations must determine and disclose ``thresholds at which severe risks posed by a model or system, unless adequately mitigated, would be deemed intolerable.''To assist in setting and operationalizing intolerable risk thresholds, we outline key principles and considerations; for example, to aim for ``good, not perfect'' thresholds in the face of limited data on rapidly advancing AI capabilities and consequently evolving risks. We also propose specific threshold recommendations, including some detailed case studies, for a subset of risks across eight risk categories: (1) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Weapons, (2) Cyber Attacks, (3) Model Autonomy, (4) Persuasion and Manipulation, (5) Deception, (6) Toxicity, (7) Discrimination, and (8) Socioeconomic Disruption. Our goal is to serve as a starting point or supplementary resource for policymakers and industry leaders, encouraging proactive risk management that prioritizes preventing intolerable risks (ex ante) rather than merely mitigating them after they occur (ex post)."
2503.05814,"Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 is the most important law in the history of the internet. It is also one of the most flawed. Under Section 230, online entities are absolutely immune from lawsuits related to content authored by third parties. The law has been essential to the internet's development over the last twenty years, but it has not kept pace with the times and is now a source of deep consternation to courts and legislatures. Lawmakers and legal scholars from across the political spectrum praise the law for what it has done, while criticizing its protection of bad-actor websites and obstruction of internet law reform.Absent from the fray, however, has been the Supreme Court, which has never issued a decision interpreting Section 230. That is poised to change, as the Court now appears determined to peel back decades of lower court case law and interpret the statute afresh to account for the tremendous technological advances of the last two decades. Rather than offer a proposal for reform, of which there are plenty, this Article acts as a guidebook to reformers by examining how we got to where we are today. It identifies those interpretive steps and missteps by which courts constructed an immunity doctrine insufficiently resilient against technological change, with the aim of aiding lawmakers and scholars in crafting an immunity doctrine better situated to accommodate future innovation."
2503.05815,"A large survey of American adults explored the complex landscape of attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI). It explored the degree of concern regarding specific potential outcomes of the new advances in AI technology and correlates of these concerns. Key variables associated with the direction and intensity of concern include prior experience using a large language model such as ChatGPT, general trust in science, adherence to the precautionary principle versus support for unrestricted innovation, and demographic factors such as gender. By analyzing these relationships, the paper provides valuable insights into the American public's response to AI that are particularly important in the development of policy to regulate or further encourage its development."
2503.0582,"This research studies the impact of AI and peer feedback on the academic writing development of Kazakhstani scholars using the CGScholar platform - a product of research into collaborative learning, big data, and artificial intelligence developed by educators and computer scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The study aimed to find out how familiarity with AI tools and peer feedback processes impacts participants' openness to incorporating feedback into their academic writing. The study involved 36 scholars enrolled in a scientific internship focused on education at UIUC. A survey with 15 multiple-choice questions, a Likert scale, and open-ended questions was used to collect data. The survey was conducted via Google Forms in both English and Russian to ensure linguistic accessibility. Demographic information such as age, gender, and first language was collected to provide a detailed understanding of the data. The analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation between familiarity with AI tools and openness to making changes based on feedback, and a strong positive correlation between research writing experience and expectations of peer feedback, especially in the area of research methodology. These results show that participants are open-minded to AI-assisted feedback; however, they still highly appreciate peer input, especially regarding methodological guidance. This study demonstrates the potential benefits of integrating AI tools with traditional feedback mechanisms to improve research writing quality in academic settings."
2503.05822,"The potential of AI researchers in scientific discovery remains largely untapped. Over the past decade, AI for Science (AI4Science) publications in 145 Nature Index journals have increased fifteen-fold, yet they still account for less than 3% of the total publications. Drawing upon the Diffusion of Innovation theory, we project AI4Science's share of total publications to rise from 2.72% in 2024 to approximately 20% by 2050. Achieving this shift requires fully harnessing the potential of AI researchers, as nearly 95% of AI-driven research in these journals is led by experimental scientists. To facilitate this, we propose structured workflows and strategic interventions to position AI researchers at the forefront of scientific discovery. Specifically, we identify three critical pathways: equipping experimental scientists with accessible AI tools to amplify the impact of AI researchers, bridging cognitive and methodological gaps to enable more direct involvement in scientific discovery, and proactively fostering a thriving AI-driven scientific ecosystem. By addressing these challenges, we aim to empower AI researchers as key drivers of future scientific breakthroughs."
2503.05823,"With the significant progress of artificial intelligence (AI) and consciousness science, artificial consciousness (AC) has recently gained popularity. This work provides a broad overview of the main topics and current trends in AC. The first part traces the history of this interdisciplinary field to establish context and clarify key terminology, including the distinction between Weak and Strong AC. The second part examines major trends in AC implementations, emphasising the synergy between Global Workspace and Attention Schema, as well as the problem of evaluating the internal states of artificial systems. The third part analyses the ethical dimension of AC development, revealing both critical risks and transformative opportunities. The last part offers recommendations to guide AC research responsibly, and outlines the limitations of this study as well as avenues for future research. The main conclusion is that while AC appears both indispensable and inevitable for scientific progress, serious efforts are required to address the far-reaching impact of this innovative research path."
2503.0583,"This article unpacks the design choices behind longstanding and newly proposed computational frameworks aimed at finding common grounds across collective preferences and examines their potential future impacts, both technically and normatively. It begins by situating AI-assisted preference elicitation within the historical role of opinion polls, emphasizing that preferences are shaped by the decision-making context and are seldom objectively captured. With that caveat in mind, we explore AI-based democratic innovations as discovery tools for fostering reasonable representations of a collective will, sense-making, and agreement-seeking. At the same time, we caution against dangerously misguided uses, such as enabling binding decisions, fostering gradual disempowerment or post-rationalizing political outcomes."
2503.05857,"This paper presents SYMBIOSIS, an AI-powered framework and platform designed to make Systems Thinking accessible for addressing societal challenges and unlock paths for leveraging systems thinking frameworks to improve AI systems. The platform establishes a centralized, open-source repository of systems thinking/system dynamics models categorized by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and societal topics using topic modeling and classification techniques. Systems Thinking resources, though critical for articulating causal theories in complex problem spaces, are often locked behind specialized tools and intricate notations, creating high barriers to entry. To address this, we developed a generative co-pilot that translates complex systems representations - such as causal loop and stock-flow diagrams - into natural language (and vice-versa), allowing users to explore and build models without extensive technical training.Rooted in community-based system dynamics (CBSD) and informed by community-driven insights on societal context, we aim to bridge the problem understanding chasm. This gap, driven by epistemic uncertainty, often limits ML developers who lack the community-specific knowledge essential for problem understanding and formulation, often leading to ill informed causal assumptions, reduced intervention effectiveness and harmful biases. Recent research identifies causal and abductive reasoning as crucial frontiers for AI, and Systems Thinking provides a naturally compatible framework for both. By making Systems Thinking frameworks more accessible and user-friendly, SYMBIOSIS aims to serve as a foundational step to unlock future research into responsible and society-centered AI. Our work underscores the need for ongoing research into AI's capacity to understand essential characteristics of complex adaptive systems paving the way for more socially attuned, effective AI systems."
2503.05937,"The rapid adoption of AI systems presents enterprises with a dual challenge: accelerating innovation while ensuring responsible governance. Current AI governance approaches suffer from fragmentation, with risk management frameworks that focus on isolated domains, regulations that vary across jurisdictions despite conceptual alignment, and high-level standards lacking concrete implementation guidance. This fragmentation increases governance costs and creates a false dichotomy between innovation and responsibility. We propose the Unified Control Framework (UCF): a comprehensive governance approach that integrates risk management and regulatory compliance through a unified set of controls. The UCF consists of three key components: (1) a comprehensive risk taxonomy synthesizing organizational and societal risks, (2) structured policy requirements derived from regulations, and (3) a parsimonious set of 42 controls that simultaneously address multiple risk scenarios and compliance requirements. We validate the UCF by mapping it to the Colorado AI Act, demonstrating how our approach enables efficient, adaptable governance that scales across regulations while providing concrete implementation guidance. The UCF reduces duplication of effort, ensures comprehensive coverage, and provides a foundation for automation, enabling organizations to achieve responsible AI governance without sacrificing innovation speed."
2503.0595,"This study explores the shift from community networks (CNs) to community data in rural areas, focusing on combining data pools and data cooperatives to achieve data justice and foster and a just AI ecosystem. With 2.7 billion people still offline, especially in the Global South, addressing data justice is critical. While discussions related to data justice have evolved to include economic dimensions, rural areas still struggle with the challenge of being adequately represented in the datasets. This study investigates a Community Data Model (CDM) that integrates the simplicity of data pools with the structured organization of data cooperatives to generate local data for AI for good. CDM leverages CNs, which have proven effective in promoting digital inclusion, to establish a centralized data repository, ensuring accessibility through open data principles. The model emphasizes community needs, prioritizing local knowledge, education, and traditional practices, with an iterative approach starting from pilot projects. Capacity building is a core component of digital literacy training and partnership with educational institutions and NGOs. The legal and regulatory dimension ensures compliance with data privacy laws. By empowering rural communities to control and manage their data, the CDM fosters equitable access and participation and sustains local identity and knowledge. This approach can mitigate the challenges of data creation in rural areas and enhance data justice. CDM can contribute to AI by improving data quality and relevance, enabling rural areas to benefit from AI advancements."
2503.06035,"This paper explores the legal implications of violating ""this http URL"", a technical standard widely used by webmasters to communicate restrictions on automated access to website content. Although historically regarded as a voluntary guideline, the rise of generative AI and large-scale web scraping has amplified the consequences of disregarding ""this http URL"" directives. While previous legal discourse has largely focused on criminal or copyright-based remedies, we argue that civil doctrines, particularly in contract and tort law, offer a more balanced and sustainable framework for regulating web robot behavior in common law jurisdictions. Under certain conditions, ""this http URL"" can give rise to a unilateral contract or serve as a form of notice sufficient to establish tortious liability, including trespass to chattels and negligence. Ultimately, we argue that clarifying liability for ""this http URL"" violations is essential to addressing the growing fragmentation of the internet. By restoring balance and accountability in the digital ecosystem, our proposed framework helps preserve the internet's open and cooperative foundations. Through this lens, ""this http URL"" can remain an equitable and effective tool for digital governance in the age of AI."
2503.06263,"As national security institutions increasingly integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into decision-making and content generation processes, understanding the inherent biases of large language models (LLMs) is crucial. This study presents a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the biases and preferences of seven prominent foundation models-Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro-002, Mixtral 8x22B, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Qwen2 72B-in the context of international relations (IR). We designed a bias discovery study around core topics in IR using 400-expert crafted scenarios to analyze results from our selected models. These scenarios focused on four topical domains including: military escalation, military and humanitarian intervention, cooperative behavior in the international system, and alliance dynamics. Our analysis reveals noteworthy variation among model recommendations based on scenarios designed for the four tested domains. Particularly, Qwen2 72B, Gemini 1.5 Pro-002 and Llama 3.1 8B Instruct models offered significantly more escalatory recommendations than Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o models. All models exhibit some degree of country-specific biases, often recommending less escalatory and interventionist actions for China and Russia compared to the United States and the United Kingdom. These findings highlight the necessity for controlled deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments, emphasizing the need for domain-specific evaluations and model fine-tuning to align with institutional objectives."
2503.06353,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress in the past few years with AI-enabled applications beginning to permeate every aspect of our society. Despite the widespread consensus on the need to regulate AI, there remains a lack of a unified approach to framing, developing, and assessing AI regulations. Many of the existing methods take a value-based approach, for example, accountability, fairness, free from bias, transparency, and trust. However, these methods often face challenges at the outset due to disagreements in academia over the subjective nature of these definitions. This paper aims to establish a unifying model for AI regulation from the perspective of core AI components. We first introduce the AI Pentad, which comprises the five essential components of AI: humans and organizations, algorithms, data, computing, and energy. We then review AI regulatory enablers, including AI registration and disclosure, AI monitoring, and AI enforcement mechanisms. Subsequently, we present the CHARME$^{2}$D Model to explore further the relationship between the AI Pentad and AI regulatory enablers. Finally, we apply the CHARME$^{2}$D model to assess AI regulatory efforts in the European Union (EU), China, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US), highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and gaps. This comparative evaluation offers insights for future legislative work in the AI domain."
2503.06523,"Generative AI is frequently portrayed as revolutionary or even apocalyptic, prompting calls for novel regulatory approaches. This essay argues that such views are misguided. Instead, generative AI should be understood as an evolutionary step in the broader algorithmic media landscape, alongside search engines and social media. Like these platforms, generative AI centralizes information control, relies on complex algorithms to shape content, and extensively uses user data, thus perpetuating common problems: unchecked corporate power, echo chambers, and weakened traditional gatekeepers. Regulation should therefore share a consistent objective: ensuring media institutions remain trustworthy. Without trust, public discourse risks fragmenting into isolated communities dominated by comforting, tribal beliefs -- a threat intensified by generative AI's capacity to bypass gatekeepers and personalize truth. Current governance frameworks, such as the EU's AI Act and the US Executive Order 14110, emphasize reactive risk mitigation, addressing measurable threats like national security, public health, and algorithmic bias. While effective for novel technological risks, this reactive approach fails to adequately address broader issues of trust and legitimacy inherent to digital media. Proactive regulation fostering transparency, accountability, and public confidence is essential. Viewing generative AI exclusively as revolutionary risks repeating past regulatory failures that left social media and search engines insufficiently regulated. Instead, regulation must proactively shape an algorithmic media environment serving the public good, supporting quality information and robust civic discourse."
2503.06525,"Analyzing student behavior in educational scenarios is crucial for enhancing teaching quality and student engagement. Existing AI-based models often rely on classroom video footage to identify and analyze student behavior. While these video-based methods can partially capture and analyze student actions, they struggle to accurately track each student's actions in physical education classes, which take place in outdoor, open spaces with diverse activities, and are challenging to generalize to the specialized technical movements involved in these settings. Furthermore, current methods typically lack the ability to integrate specialized pedagogical knowledge, limiting their ability to provide in-depth insights into student behavior and offer feedback for optimizing instructional design. To address these limitations, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that leverages human activity recognition technologies based on motion signals, combined with advanced large language models, to conduct more detailed analyses and feedback of student behavior in physical education classes. Our framework begins with the teacher's instructional designs and the motion signals from students during physical education sessions, ultimately generating automated reports with teaching insights and suggestions for improving both learning and class instructions. This solution provides a motion signal-based approach for analyzing student behavior and optimizing instructional design tailored to physical education classes. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework can accurately identify student behaviors and produce meaningful pedagogical insights."
2503.0725,"Because digital devices and systems are widely used in all aspects of society, the risk of adversaries creating cyberattacks on a similar level remains high. As such, regulation of these aspects must follow, which is the domain of cybersecurity. Because this topic is worldwide, different jurisdictions should take inspiration from successful techniques elsewhere, with the European Union and the US being the most experienced and long-standing. What can be derived from their approaches separately to be used in other democratic jurisdictions, and what happens when we compare them with this pragmatic approach in mind? Cybersecurity is oddly enough quite well understood in most jurisdictions worldwide. However, concept comprehension cannot enforce or create compliance, hence the need for good regulatory approaches. The comparative legal analysis of the EU and the US show that there are large differences in definitions and enforcement, but some concepts are repeated in both jurisdictions. These can be further refined to become derivable principles, which can be used to inspire legislation in any democratic jurisdiction. They are: Voluntary Cooperation, Adaptable Definitions, Strong-arm Authorities, Mandated Computer Emergency Response Teams, and Effective Sanctions. These 5 principles are not exhaustive but combine classic regulatory and practical lessons from these two jurisdictions."
2503.07326,"The understanding of bias in AI is currently undergoing a revolution. Initially understood as errors or flaws, biases are increasingly recognized as integral to AI systems and sometimes preferable to less biased alternatives. In this paper, we review the reasons for this changed understanding and provide new guidance on two questions: First, how should we think about and measure biases in AI systems, consistent with the new understanding? Second, what kinds of bias in an AI system should we accept or even amplify, and what kinds should we minimize or eliminate, and why? The key to answering both questions, we argue, is to understand biases as ""violations of a symmetry standard"" (following Kelly). We distinguish three main types of asymmetry in AI systems-error biases, inequality biases, and process biases-and highlight places in the pipeline of AI development and application where bias of each type is likely to be good, bad, or inevitable."
2503.07496,"This paper examines the critical challenges and potential solutions for conducting secure and effective external evaluations of general-purpose AI (GPAI) models. With the exponential growth in size, capability, reach and accompanying risk of these models, ensuring accountability, safety, and public trust requires frameworks that go beyond traditional black-box methods. The discussion begins with an analysis of the need for deeper-than-black-box evaluations (Section I), emphasizing the importance of understanding model internals to uncover latent risks and ensure compliance with ethical and regulatory standards. Building on this foundation, Section II addresses the security considerations of remote evaluations, outlining the threat landscape, technical solutions, and safeguards necessary to protect both evaluators and proprietary model data. Finally, Section III synthesizes these insights into actionable recommendations and future directions, aiming to establish a robust, scalable, and transparent framework for external assessments in GPAI governance."
2503.0751,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of generating opinions and propagating bias unknowingly, originating from unrepresentative and non-diverse data collection. Prior research has analysed these opinions with respect to the West, particularly the United States. However, insights thus produced may not be generalized in non-Western populations. With the widespread usage of LLM systems by users across several different walks of life, the cultural sensitivity of each generated output is of crucial interest. Our work proposes a novel method that quantitatively analyzes the opinions generated by LLMs, improving on previous work with regards to extracting the social demographics of the models. Our method measures the distance from an LLM's response to survey respondents, through Hamming Distance, to infer the demographic characteristics reflected in the model's outputs. We evaluate modern, open LLMs such as Llama and Mistral on surveys conducted in various global south countries, with a focus on India and other Asian nations, specifically assessing the model's performance on surveys related to religious tolerance and identity. Our analysis reveals that most open LLMs match a single homogeneous profile, varying across different countries/territories, which in turn raises questions about the risks of LLMs promoting a hegemonic worldview, and undermining perspectives of different minorities. Our framework may also be useful for future research investigating the complex intersection between training data, model architecture, and the resulting biases reflected in LLM outputs, particularly concerning sensitive topics like religious tolerance and identity."
2503.07676,"This article examines how unequal access to AI innovation creates systemic challenges for developing countries. Differential access to AI innovation results from the acute competition between domestic and global actors. While developing nations contribute significantly to AI development through data annotation labor, they face limited access to advanced AI technologies and are increasingly caught between divergent regulatory approaches from democratic and authoritarian tendencies. This brief paper analyzes how more affordable AI engagement and Western countries' development cooperation present developing nations with a complex choice between accessibility and governance standards. I argue this challenge entails new institutional mechanisms for technology transfer and regulatory cooperation, while carefully balancing universal standards with local needs. In turn, good practices could help developing countries close the deepening gap of global technological divides, while ensuring responsible AI development in developing countries."
2503.07685,"In early 2025, Augmented Intelligence - Christie's first AI art auction - drew criticism for showcasing a controversial genre. Amid wider legal uncertainty, artists voiced concerns over data mining practices, notably with respect to copyright. The backlash could be viewed as a microcosm of AI's contested position in the creative economy. Touching on the auction's presentation, reception, and results, this paper explores how, among social dissonance, machine learning finds its place in the artworld. Foregrounding responsible innovation, the paper provides a balanced perspective that champions creators' rights and brings nuance to this polarised debate. With a focus on exhibition design, it centres framing, which refers to the way a piece is presented to influence consumer perception. Context plays a central role in shaping our understanding of how good, valuable, and even ethical an artwork is. In this regard, Augmented Intelligence situates AI art within a surprisingly traditional framework, leveraging hallmarks of ""high art"" to establish the genre's cultural credibility. Generative AI has a clear economic dimension, converging questions of artistic merit with those of monetary worth. Scholarship on ways of seeing, or framing, could substantively inform the interpretation and evaluation of creative outputs, including assessments of their aesthetic and commercial value."
2503.0769,"Digital deliberation has expanded democratic participation, yet challenges remain. This includes processing information at scale, moderating discussions, fact-checking, or attracting people to participate. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer potential solutions, but public perceptions of AI's role in deliberation remain underexplored. Beyond efficiency, democratic deliberation is about voice and recognition. If AI is integrated into deliberation, public trust, acceptance, and willingness to participate may be affected. We conducted a preregistered survey experiment with a representative sample in Germany (n=1850) to examine how information about AI-enabled deliberation influences willingness to participate and perceptions of deliberative quality. Respondents were randomly assigned to treatments that provided them information about deliberative tasks facilitated by either AI or humans. Our findings reveal a significant AI-penalty. Participants were less willing to engage in AI-facilitated deliberation and rated its quality lower than human-led formats. These effects were moderated by individual predispositions. Perceptions of AI's societal benefits and anthropomorphization of AI showed positive interaction effects on people's interest to participate in AI-enabled deliberative formats and positive quality assessments, while AI risk assessments showed negative interactions with information about AI-enabled deliberation. These results suggest AI-enabled deliberation faces substantial public skepticism, potentially even introducing a new deliberative divide. Unlike traditional participation gaps based on education or demographics, this divide is shaped by attitudes toward AI. As democratic engagement increasingly moves online, ensuring AI's role in deliberation does not discourage participation or deepen inequalities will be a key challenge for future research and policy."
2503.08003,"The rapid advancement of generative AI technology, particularly video generative AI (Video GenAI), has opened new possibilities for K-12 education by enabling the creation of dynamic, customized, and high-quality visual content. Despite its potential, there is limited research on how this emerging technology can be effectively integrated into educational practices. This study explores the perspectives of leading K-12 teachers on the educational applications of Video GenAI, using the TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) and TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) frameworks as analytical lenses. Through interviews and hands-on experimentation with video generation tools, the research identifies opportunities for enhancing teaching strategies, fostering student engagement, and supporting authentic task design. It also highlights challenges such as technical limitations, ethical considerations, and the need for institutional support. The findings provide actionable insights into how Video GenAI can transform teaching and learning, offering practical implications for policy, teacher training, and the future development of educational technology."
2503.08426,"In this paper, we present an educational project aimed to introduce students to the technology behind Captive Portals infrastructures. For doing this, we developed a series of modules to emphasize each of the different aspects and features of this technology. The project is based on an open source implementation which is widely used in many computer network courses, making it well-suited and very appealing for instructors and practitioners in this field."
2503.08543,"School districts across the United States (US) play a pivotal role in shaping access to quality education through their student assignment policies -- most prominently, school attendance boundaries. Community engagement processes for changing such policies, however, are often opaque, cumbersome, and highly polarizing -- hampering equitable access to quality schools in ways that can perpetuate disparities in future life outcomes. In this paper, we describe a collaboration with a large US public school district serving nearly 150,000 students to design and evaluate a new sociotechnical system, ""BoundarEase"", for fostering more constructive community engagement around changing school attendance boundaries. Through a formative study with 16 community members, we first identify several frictions in existing community engagement processes, like individualistic over collective thinking; a failure to understand and empathize with the different ways policies might impact other community members; and challenges in understanding the impacts of boundary changes. These frictions inspire the design and development of BoundarEase, a web platform that allows community members to explore and offer feedback on potential boundaries. A user study with 12 community members reveals that BoundarEase prompts reflection among community members on how policies might impact families beyond their own, and increases transparency around the details of policy proposals. Our paper offers education researchers insights into the challenges and opportunities involved in community engagement for designing student assignment policies; human-computer interaction researchers a case study of how new sociotechnical systems might help mitigate polarization in local policymaking; and school districts a practical tool they might use to facilitate community engagement to foster more equitable student assignment policies."
2503.08562,"Mental health challenges among Indian adolescents are shaped by unique cultural and systemic barriers, including high social stigma and limited professional support. Through a mixed-methods study involving a survey of 278 adolescents and follow-up interviews with 12 participants, we explore how adolescents perceive mental health challenges and interact with digital tools. Quantitative results highlight low self-stigma but significant social stigma, a preference for text over voice interactions, and low utilization of mental health apps but high smartphone access. Our qualitative findings reveal that while adolescents value privacy, emotional support, and localized content in mental health tools, existing chatbots lack personalization and cultural relevance. These findings inform recommendations for culturally sensitive chatbot design that prioritizes anonymity, tailored support, and localized resources to better meet the needs of adolescents in India. This work advances culturally sensitive chatbot design by centering underrepresented populations, addressing critical gaps in accessibility and support for adolescents in India."
2503.08565,"This essay examines how Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming design practices and how discourse often falls into over-simplified narratives that impede meaningful research and practical progress. We identify and deconstruct five prevalent ""semantic stopsigns"" -- reductive framings about GenAI in design that halt deeper inquiry and limit productive engagement. Reflecting upon two expert workshops at ACM conferences and semi-structured interviews with design practitioners, we analyze how these stopsigns manifest in research and practice. Our analysis develops mid-level knowledge that bridges theoretical discourse and practical implementation, helping designers and researchers interrogate common assumptions about GenAI in their own contexts. By recasting these stopsigns into more nuanced frameworks, we provide the design research community with practical approaches for thinking about and working with these emerging technologies."
2503.08688,"Research on the 'cultural alignment' of Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged in response to growing interest in understanding representation across diverse stakeholders. Current approaches to evaluating cultural alignment through survey-based assessments that borrow from social science methodologies often overlook systematic robustness checks. Here, we identify and test three assumptions behind current survey-based evaluation methods: (1) Stability: that cultural alignment is a property of LLMs rather than an artifact of evaluation design, (2) Extrapolability: that alignment with one culture on a narrow set of issues predicts alignment with that culture on others, and (3) Steerability: that LLMs can be reliably prompted to represent specific cultural perspectives. Through experiments examining both explicit and implicit preferences of leading LLMs, we find a high level of instability across presentation formats, incoherence between evaluated versus held-out cultural dimensions, and erratic behavior under prompt steering. We show that these inconsistencies can cause the results of an evaluation to be very sensitive to minor variations in methodology. Finally, we demonstrate in a case study on evaluation design that narrow experiments and a selective assessment of evidence can be used to paint an incomplete picture of LLMs' cultural alignment properties. Overall, these results highlight significant limitations of current survey-based approaches to evaluating the cultural alignment of LLMs and highlight a need for systematic robustness checks and red-teaming for evaluation results. Data and code are available atthis https URLandthis https URL, respectively."
2503.0872,"""why"" we develop AI. Lacking critical reflections on the general visions and purposes of AI may make the community vulnerable to manipulation. In this position paper, we explore the ""why"" question of AI. We denote answers to the ""why"" question the imaginations of AI, which depict our general visions, frames, and mindsets for the prospects of AI. We identify that the prevailing vision in the AI community is largely a monoculture that emphasizes objectives such as replacing humans and improving productivity. Our critical examination of this mainstream imagination highlights its underpinning and potentially unjust assumptions. We then call to diversify our collective imaginations of AI, embedding ethical assumptions from the outset in the imaginations of AI. To facilitate the community's pursuit of diverse imaginations, we demonstrate one process for constructing a new imagination of ""AI for just work,"" and showcase its application in the medical image synthesis task to make it more ethical. We hope this work will help the AI community to open critical dialogues with civil society on the visions and purposes of AI, and inspire more technical works and advocacy in pursuit of diverse and ethical imaginations to restore the value of AI for the public good."
2503.08725,"As artificial intelligence transforms public sector operations, governments struggle to integrate technological innovations into coherent systems for effective service delivery. This paper introduces the Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA), a novel four-layer framework conceptualising how Digital Public Infrastructure, Data-for-Policy, Algorithmic Government/Governance, and GovTech interact as an integrated system in AI-enabled states. Unlike approaches that treat these as parallel developments, ASA positions them as interdependent layers with specific enabling relationships and feedback mechanisms. Through comparative analysis of implementations in Estonia, Singapore, India, and the UK, we demonstrate how foundational digital infrastructure enables systematic data collection, which powers algorithmic decision-making processes, ultimately manifesting in user-facing services. Our analysis reveals that successful implementations require balanced development across all layers, with particular attention to integration mechanisms between them. The framework contributes to both theory and practice by bridging previously disconnected domains of digital government research, identifying critical dependencies that influence implementation success, and providing a structured approach for analysing the maturity and development pathways of AI-enabled government systems."
2503.08876,"This paper investigates a problem about freedom of information. Although freedom of information is generally considered desirable, there are a number of areas where there is substantial agreement that freedom of information should be limited. After a certain ordering of the landscape, I argue that we need to add the category of 'dangerous' information and that this category has gained a new quality in the context of current information technology, specifically the Internet. This category includes information the use of which would be morally wrong as well as some of what may be called 'corrupting' information. Some such information should not be spread at all and some should be very limited in its spread."
2503.08931,"Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational technology presents unprecedented opportunities to improve instructional design (ID), yet existing approaches often prioritize automation over pedagogical rigor and human agency. This paper introduces ARCHED (AI for Responsible, Collaborative, Human-centered Education Instructional Design), a structured multi-stage framework that ensures human educators remain central in the design process while leveraging AI capabilities. Unlike traditional AI-generated instructional materials that lack transparency, ARCHED employs a cascaded workflow aligned with Bloom's taxonomy. The framework integrates specialized AI agents - one generating diverse pedagogical options and another evaluating alignment with learning objectives - while maintaining educators as primary decision-makers. This approach addresses key limitations in current AI-assisted instructional design, ensuring transparency, pedagogical foundation, and meaningful human agency. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ARCHED enhances instructional design quality while preserving educator oversight, marking a step forward in responsible AI integration in education."
2503.09129,"We speak of a \textit{computational law} when that law is intended to be enforced by software through an automated decision-making process. As digital technologies evolve to offer more solutions for public administrations, we see an ever-increasing number of computational laws. Traditionally, law is written in natural language. Computational laws, however, suffer various complications when written in natural language, such as underspecification and ambiguity which lead to a diversity of possible interpretations to be made by the coder. These could potentially result into an uneven application of the law. Thus, resorting to formal languages to write computational laws is tempting. However, writing laws in a formal language leads to further complications, for example, incomprehensibility for non-experts, lack of explicit motivation of the decisions made, or difficulties in retrieving the data leading to the outcome. In this paper, we investigate how certain legal principles fare in both scenarios: computational law written in natural language or written in formal language. We use a running example from the European Union's road transport regulation to showcase the tensions arising, and the benefits from each language."
2503.09276,"Effective lesson planning is crucial in education process, serving as the cornerstone for high-quality teaching and the cultivation of a conducive learning atmosphere. This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can enhance teacher preparation by incorporating them with Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction, especially in the field of mathematics education in compulsory education. It investigates two distinct methodologies: the development of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts to direct LLMs in generating content that aligns with instructional events, and the application of fine-tuning approaches like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enhance model performance. This research starts with creating a comprehensive dataset based on math curriculum standards and Gagne's instructional events. The first method involves crafting CoT-optimized prompts to generate detailed, logically coherent responses from LLMs, improving their ability to create educationally relevant content. The second method uses specialized datasets to fine-tune open-source models, enhancing their educational content generation and analysis capabilities. This study contributes to the evolving dialogue on the integration of AI in education, illustrating innovative strategies for leveraging LLMs to bolster teaching and learning processes."
2503.09612,"Technology can pose signicant risks to a wide array of vulnerable populations.

2503.09637,"This study investigates the near-future impacts of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on occupational competencies across the U.S. federal workforce. We develop a multi-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation system to leverage large language models for predictive AI modeling that projects shifts in required competencies and to identify vulnerable occupations on a knowledge-by-skill-by-ability basis across the federal government workforce. This study highlights policy recommendations essential for workforce planning in the era of AI. We integrate several sources of detailed data on occupational requirements across the federal government from both centralized and decentralized human resource sources, including from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and various federal agencies. While our preliminary findings suggest some significant shifts in required competencies and potential vulnerability of certain roles to AI-driven changes, we provide nuanced insights that support arguments against abrupt or generic approaches to strategic human capital planning around the development of generative AI. The study aims to inform strategic workforce planning and policy development within federal agencies and demonstrates how this approach can be replicated across other large employment institutions and labor markets."
2503.09748,"This study systematically reviews the transformative role of Tutoring Systems, encompassing Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) and Robot Tutoring Systems (RTS), in addressing global educational challenges through advanced technologies. As many students struggle with proficiency in core academic areas, Tutoring Systems emerge as promising solutions to bridge learning gaps by delivering personalized and adaptive instruction. ITS leverages artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and Large Language Models, to provide precise cognitive support, while RTS enhances social and emotional engagement through human-like interactions. This systematic review, adhering to the PRISMA framework, analyzed 86 representative studies. We evaluated the pedagogical and technological advancements, engagement strategies, and ethical considerations surrounding these systems. Based on these parameters, Latent Class Analysis was conducted and identified three distinct categories: computer-based ITS, robot-based RTS, and multimodal systems integrating various interaction modes. The findings reveal significant advancements in AI techniques that enhance adaptability, engagement, and learning outcomes. However, challenges such as ethical concerns, scalability issues, and gaps in cognitive adaptability persist. The study highlights the complementary strengths of ITS and RTS, proposing integrated hybrid solutions to maximize educational benefits. Future research should focus on bridging gaps in scalability, addressing ethical considerations comprehensively, and advancing AI models to support diverse educational needs."
2503.09832,"Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) can foster social interaction and relationship formation, but they pose specific privacy and safety challenges, especially in the context of mediating intimate interpersonal connections. To explore the potential risks, we conducted a case study on Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV) players intimate partner seeking posts on social media. We analyzed 1,288 posts from a public Weibo account using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling and thematic analysis. Our findings reveal that players disclose sensitive personal information and share vulnerabilities to establish trust but face difficulties in managing identity and privacy across multiple platforms. We also found that players expectations regarding intimate partner are diversified, and mismatch of expectations may leads to issues like privacy leakage or emotional exploitation. Based on our findings, we propose design implications for reducing privacy and safety risks and fostering healthier social interactions in virtual worlds."
2503.09882,"COVID-19 disrupted the professional preparation of university students, with less opportunity to engage in professional practice due to a reduced employment market. Little is known about how this period impacted upon the career confidence and career identity of university students. This research paper explores the career confidence and identity of university students in Information Technology (IT) prior and during the COVID-19 period. Using a survey method and quantitative analysis, ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests with different sensitivity and variance standards were used during analysis to present mean and mean rank of data collected during 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. 1349 IT students from an Australian University reported their career confidence. The results indicate IT students' career confidence maintained during the period. In 2021, the results indicate increased career commitment of IT students showing higher professional expectations to work in IT along with greater self-awareness regarding their professional development needs. Even with increased career confidence as observed in this study, supporting university students to explore their career options and build upon their career identity, and more broadly their employability, remains an important activity for universities to curate in their graduates."
2503.1014,"In an era where economies and societies are deeply integrated into cyberspace, achieving a robust level of digital sovereignty has become an essential goal for nations aiming to preserve their security and strategic political autonomy, particularly during turbulent geopolitical times marked by complex global supply chains of critical technologies that ties systemic rivals. Digital sovereignty is a multifaceted, interdisciplinary, and dynamic pursuit that fundamentally relies on a nation's ability to have continuous access to dependable technological capabilities (CTCs) for storing, transferring, and processing domestically produced data. This paper identifies how access continuity or technological dependability could be threatened by several malicious actions from cyberattacks, supply chain tamperings, political or economic actions. By examining different approaches adopted by countries like the United States, China, and the European Union, we highlight different strategies to get access to CTCs depending on their political, economic and institutional nature."
2503.10458,"Social media platforms have been accused of causing a range of harms, resulting in dozens of lawsuits across jurisdictions. These lawsuits are situated within the context of a long history of American product safety litigation, suggesting opportunities for remediation outside of financial compensation. Anticipating that at least some of these cases may be successful and/or lead to settlements, this article outlines an implementable mechanism for an abatement and/or settlement plan capable of mitigating abuse. The paper describes the requirements of such a mechanism, implications for privacy and oversight, and tradeoffs that such a procedure would entail. The mechanism is framed to operate at the intersection of legal procedure, standards for transparent public health assessment, and the practical requirements of modern technology products."
2503.10556,"In this study, we examined whether a short-form AI literacy intervention could reduce the adoption of incorrect recommendations from large language models. High school seniors were randomly assigned to either a control or an intervention group, which received an educational text explaining ChatGPT's working mechanism, limitations, and proper use. Participants solved math puzzles with the help of ChatGPT's recommendations, which were incorrect in half of the cases. Results showed that students adopted incorrect suggestions 52.1% of the time, indicating widespread over-reliance. The educational intervention did not significantly reduce over-reliance. Instead, it led to an increase in ignoring ChatGPT's correct recommendations. We conclude that the usage of ChatGPT is associated with over-reliance and it is not trivial to increase AI literacy to counter over-reliance."
2503.10649,"Political biases in Large Language Model (LLM)-based artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini, have been previously reported. While several prior studies have attempted to quantify these biases using political orientation tests, such approaches are limited by potential tests' calibration biases and constrained response formats that do not reflect real-world human-AI interactions. This study employs a multi-method approach to assess political bias in leading AI systems, integrating four complementary methodologies: (1) linguistic comparison of AI-generated text with the language used by Republican and Democratic U.S. Congress members, (2) analysis of political viewpoints embedded in AI-generated policy recommendations, (3) sentiment analysis of AI-generated text toward politically affiliated public figures, and (4) standardized political orientation testing. Results indicate a consistent left-leaning bias across most contemporary AI systems, with arguably varying degrees of intensity. However, this bias is not an inherent feature of LLMs; prior research demonstrates that fine-tuning with politically skewed data can realign these models across the ideological spectrum. The presence of systematic political bias in AI systems poses risks, including reduced viewpoint diversity, increased societal polarization, and the potential for public mistrust in AI technologies. To mitigate these risks, AI systems should be designed to prioritize factual accuracy while maintaining neutrality on most lawful normative issues. Furthermore, independent monitoring platforms are necessary to ensure transparency, accountability, and responsible AI development."
2503.1126,"This paper investigates the relationship between smart city initiatives and evolving urbanization trends in the United States. The research addresses the critical issue of rapid urban growth in the U.S. and explores how innovations within the smart city paradigm influence urban development. Utilizing principles from Urban Complexity Theory, this study identifies four key variables relevant to smart cities and their impact on urbanization: smart city technology, government policy, environmental sustainability, and socioeconomic factors. A mixed-method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies, was employed. A web-based survey (n=50) utilizing a five-point Likert scale was conducted among residents of Manhattan, New York, and Capitol Hill, Seattle. Results indicate that the implementation of smart city technologies is significantly associated with shifts in population density, land use diversification, and enhanced infrastructure dynamics. Additionally, residents demonstrated preferences for smart cities based on efficient urban mobility, environmental sustainability, and personal socioeconomic improvements. The findings highlight essential considerations for urban planners, policymakers, and employers. This study concludes that incorporating the identified influential factors into strategic urban planning optimizes city development to better accommodate growing urban populations."
2503.11531,"The increasing amount of pressure related to water and energy shortages has increased the urgency of cultivating individual conservation behaviors. While the concept of nudging, i.e., providing usage-based feedback, has shown promise in encouraging conservation behaviors, its efficacy is often constrained by the lack of targeted and actionable content. This study investigates the impact of the use of large language models (LLMs) to provide tailored conservation suggestions for conservation intentions and their rationale. Through a survey experiment with 1,515 university participants, we compare three virtual nudging scenarios: no nudging, traditional nudging with usage statistics, and LLM-powered nudging with usage statistics and personalized conservation suggestions. The results of statistical analyses and causal forest modeling reveal that nudging led to an increase in conservation intentions among 86.9%-98.0% of the participants. LLM-powered nudging achieved a maximum increase of 18.0% in conservation intentions, surpassing traditional nudging by 88.6%. Furthermore, structural equation modeling results reveal that exposure to LLM-powered nudges enhances self-efficacy and outcome expectations while diminishing dependence on social norms, thereby increasing intrinsic motivation to conserve. These findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in promoting individual water and energy conservation, representing a new frontier in the design of sustainable behavioral interventions and resource management."
2503.11572,"Implicit biases refer to automatic mental processes that shape perceptions, judgments, and behaviors. Previous research on ""implicit bias'' in LLMs focused primarily on outputs rather than the processes underlying the outputs. We present the Reasoning Model Implicit Association Test (RM-IAT) to study implicit bias-like processing in reasoning models, which are LLMs that use step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks. Using RM-IAT, we find that reasoning models like o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, gpt-oss-20b, and Qwen-3 8B consistently expend more reasoning tokens on association-incompatible tasks than association-compatible tasks, suggesting greater computational effort when processing counter-stereotypical information. In contrast, Claude 3.7 Sonnet exhibited reversed or inconsistent patterns, likely due to embedded safety mechanisms that flagged or rejected socially sensitive associations. These divergent behaviors highlight important differences in how alignment and safety processes shape model reasoning. As reasoning models become increasingly integrated into real-world decision-making, understanding their implicit bias-like patterns and how alignment methods influence them is crucial for ensuring fair and trustworthy AI systems."
2503.11705,"We present our Balanced, Integrated and Grounded (BIG) argument for assuring the safety of AI systems. The BIG argument adopts a whole-system approach to constructing a safety case for AI systems of varying capability, autonomy and criticality. Firstly, it is balanced by addressing safety alongside other critical ethical issues such as privacy and equity, acknowledging complexities and trade-offs in the broader societal impact of AI. Secondly, it is integrated by bringing together the social, ethical and technical aspects of safety assurance in a way that is traceable and accountable. Thirdly, it is grounded in long-established safety norms and practices, such as being sensitive to context and maintaining risk proportionality. Whether the AI capability is narrow and constrained or general-purpose and powered by a frontier or foundational model, the BIG argument insists on a systematic treatment of safety. Further, it places a particular focus on the novel hazardous behaviours emerging from the advanced capabilities of frontier AI models and the open contexts in which they are rapidly being deployed. These complex issues are considered within a wider AI safety case, approaching assurance from both technical and sociotechnical perspectives. Examples illustrating the use of the BIG argument are provided throughout the paper."
2503.11713,"Social predictions do not passively describe the future; they actively shape it. They inform actions and change individual expectations in ways that influence the likelihood of the predicted outcome. Given these dynamics, to what extent can social events be predicted? This question was discussed throughout the 20th century by authors like Merton, Morgenstern, Simon, and others who considered it a central issue in social science methodology. In this work, we provide a modern answer to this old problem. Using recent ideas from performative prediction and outcome indistinguishability, we establish that one can always efficiently predict social events accurately, regardless of how predictions influence data. While achievable, we also show that these predictions are often undesirable, highlighting the limitations of previous desiderata. We end with a discussion of various avenues forward."
2503.11714,"Picture a community torn over a proposed zoning law. Some are angry, others defensive, and misunderstandings abound. On social media, they broadcast insults at one another; every nuanced perspective is reduced to a viral soundbite. Yet, when they meet face-to-face and start speaking, something changes: residents begin listening more than speaking, and people begin testing ideas together. Misunderstandings fade, and trust begins to form. By the end of their discussion, they have not only softened their hostility, but discovered actionable plans that benefit everyone.This is the kind of meaningful discourse our society desperately needs. Yet our digital platforms -- designed primarily for maximizing engagement through provocative content -- have pulled us away from these core community endeavours. As a constructive path forward, we introduce the idea of conversation networks as a basis for civic communication infrastructure that combines interoperable digital apps with the thoughtful integration of AI guided by human agency."
2503.11727,"The growing homelessness crisis in the U.S. presents complex social, economic, and public health challenges, straining shelters, healthcare, and social services while limiting effective interventions. Traditional assessment methods struggle to capture its dynamic, dispersed nature, highlighting the need for scalable, data-driven detection. This survey explores computational approaches across four domains: (1) computer vision and deep learning to identify encampments and urban indicators of homelessness, (2) air quality sensing via fixed, mobile, and crowdsourced deployments to assess environmental risks, (3) IoT and edge computing for real-time urban monitoring, and (4) pedestrian behavior analysis to understand mobility patterns and interactions. Despite advancements, challenges persist in computational constraints, data privacy, accurate environmental measurement, and adaptability. This survey synthesizes recent research, identifies key gaps, and highlights opportunities to enhance homelessness detection, optimize resource allocation, and improve urban planning and social support systems for equitable aid distribution and better neighborhood conditions."
2503.11733,"Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in automating tasks and driving innovation across diverse educational applications. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of state-of-the-art research on LLM agents in education, categorizing them into two broad classes: (1) \emph{Pedagogical Agents}, which focus on automating complex pedagogical tasks to support both teachers and students; and (2) \emph{Domain-Specific Educational Agents}, which are tailored for specialized fields such as science education, language learning, and professional development. We comprehensively examine the technological advancements underlying these LLM agents, including key datasets, benchmarks, and algorithmic frameworks that drive their effectiveness. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges such as privacy, bias and fairness concerns, hallucination mitigation, and integration with existing educational ecosystems. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive technological overview of LLM agents for education, fostering further research and collaboration to enhance their impact for the greater good of learners and educators alike."
2503.11922,"Foundation models - models trained on broad data that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks - can pose significant risks, ranging from intimate image abuse, cyberattacks, to bioterrorism. To reduce these risks, policymakers are starting to impose obligations on the developers of these models. However, downstream developers - actors who fine-tune or otherwise modify foundational models - can create or amplify risks by improving a model's capabilities or compromising its safety features. This can make rules on upstream developers ineffective. One way to address this issue could be to impose direct obligations on downstream developers. However, since downstream developers are numerous, diverse, and rapidly growing in number, such direct regulation may be both practically challenging and stifling to innovation. A different approach would be to require upstream developers to mitigate downstream modification risks (e.g. by restricting what modifications can be made). Another approach would be to use alternative policy tools (e.g. clarifying how existing tort law applies to downstream developers or issuing voluntary guidance to help mitigate downstream modification risks). We expect that regulation on upstream developers to mitigate downstream modification risks will be necessary. Although further work is needed, regulation of downstream developers may also be warranted where they retain the ability to increase risk to an unacceptable level."
2503.11947,"The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital platforms used by youth has created significant challenges related to privacy, autonomy, and data protection. While AI-driven personalization offers enhanced user experiences, it often operates without clear ethical boundaries, leaving young users vulnerable to data exploitation and algorithmic biases. This paper presents a call to action for ethical AI governance, advocating for a structured framework that ensures youth-centred privacy protections, transparent data practices, and regulatory oversight. We outline key areas requiring urgent intervention, including algorithmic transparency, privacy education, parental data-sharing ethics, and accountability measures. Through this approach, we seek to empower youth with greater control over their digital identities and propose actionable strategies for policymakers, AI developers, and educators to build a fairer and more accountable AI ecosystem."
2503.1195,"The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital ecosystems has reshaped privacy dynamics, particularly for young digital citizens navigating data-driven environments. This study explores evolving privacy concerns across three key stakeholder groups, digital citizens (ages 16-19), parents/educators, and AI professionals, and assesses differences in data ownership, trust, transparency, parental mediation, education, and risk-benefit perceptions. Employing a grounded theory methodology, this research synthesizes insights from 482 participants through structured surveys, qualitative interviews, and focus groups. The findings reveal distinct privacy expectations: Young users emphasize autonomy and digital freedom, while parents and educators advocate for regulatory oversight and AI literacy programs. AI professionals, in contrast, prioritize the balance between ethical system design and technological efficiency. The data further highlights gaps in AI literacy and transparency, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, stakeholder-driven privacy frameworks that accommodate diverse user needs. Using comparative thematic analysis, this study identifies key tensions in privacy governance and develops the novel Privacy-Ethics Alignment in AI (PEA-AI) model, which structures privacy decision-making as a dynamic negotiation between stakeholders. By systematically analyzing themes such as transparency, user control, risk perception, and parental mediation, this research provides a scalable, adaptive foundation for AI governance, ensuring that privacy protections evolve alongside emerging AI technologies and youth-centric digital interactions."
2503.12166,"Conspiracy theories present significant societal challenges, shaping political behavior, eroding public trust, and disrupting social cohesion. Addressing their impact requires recognizing that conspiracy engagement is not a singular act but a multi-stage process involving distinct cognitive and behavioral transitions. In this study, we investigate this sequential progression, ""recognition,"" ""belief,"" and ""action"" (demonstrative action and diffusion action), using nationally representative surveys from the United States (N=13,578) and Japan (N=16,693). Applying a Bayesian hierarchical model, we identify the key social, political, and economic factors that drive engagement at each stage, providing a structured framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying conspiracy theory adoption and dissemination. We find that recognition serves as a crucial gateway determining who transitions to belief, and that demonstrative and diffusion actions are shaped by distinct factors. Demonstrative actions are more prevalent among younger, higher-status individuals with strong political alignments, whereas diffusion actions occur across broader demographics, particularly among those engaged with diverse media channels. Our findings further reveal that early-life economic and cultural capital significantly influence the shape of conspiratorial engagement, emphasizing the role of life-course experiences. These insights highlight the necessity of distinguishing between different forms of conspiracy engagement and highlight the importance of targeted interventions that account for structural, cultural, and psychological factors to mitigate their spread and societal impact."
2503.12207,"""Explain in Plain English"" (EiPE) questions are widely used to assess code comprehension skills but are challenging to grade automatically. Recent approaches like Code Generation Based Grading (CGBG) leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate code from student explanations and validate its equivalence to the original code using unit tests. However, this approach does not differentiate between high-level, purpose-focused responses and low-level, implementation-focused ones, limiting its effectiveness in assessing comprehension level. We propose a modified approach where students generate function names, emphasizing the function's purpose over implementation details. We evaluate this method in an introductory programming course and analyze it using Item Response Theory (IRT) to understand its effectiveness as exam items and its alignment with traditional EiPE grading standards. We also publish this work as an open source Python package for autograding EiPE questions, providing a scalable solution for adoption."
2503.12216,"Reading and understanding code are fundamental skills for novice programmers, and especially important with the growing prevalence of AI-generated code and the need to evaluate its accuracy and reliability. ``Explain in Plain English'' questions are a widely used approach for assessing code comprehension, but providing automated feedback, particularly on comprehension levels, is a challenging task. This paper introduces a novel method for automatically assessing the comprehension level of responses to ``Explain in Plain English'' questions. Central to this is the ability to distinguish between two response types: multi-structural, where students describe the code line-by-line, and relational, where they explain the code's overall purpose. Using a Large Language Model (LLM) to segment both the student's description and the code, we aim to determine whether the student describes each line individually (many segments) or the code as a whole (fewer segments). We evaluate this approach's effectiveness by comparing segmentation results with human classifications, achieving substantial agreement. We conclude with how this approach, which we release as an open source Python package, could be used as a formative feedback mechanism."
2503.12321,"Improving undergraduate success in STEM requires identifying actionable factors that impact student outcomes, allowing institutions to prioritize key leverage points for change. We examined academic, demographic, and institutional factors that might be associated with graduation rates at two four-year colleges in the northeastern United States using a novel association algorithm called D-basis to rank attributes associated with graduation. Importantly, the data analyzed included tracking data from the National Student Clearinghouse on students who left their original institutions to determine outcomes following transfer.Key predictors of successful graduation include performance in introductory STEM courses, the choice of first mathematics class, and flexibility in major selection. High grades in introductory biology, general chemistry, and mathematics courses were strongly correlated with graduation. At the same time, students who switched majors - especially from STEM to non-STEM - had higher overall graduation rates. Additionally, Pell eligibility and demographic factors, though less predictive overall, revealed disparities in time to graduation and retention rates.The findings highlight the importance of early academic support in STEM gateway courses and the implementation of institutional policies that provide flexibility in major selection. Enhancing student success in introductory mathematics, biology, and chemistry courses could greatly influence graduation rates. Furthermore, customized mathematics pathways and focused support for STEM courses may assist institutions in optimizing student outcomes. This study offers data-driven insights to guide strategies to increase STEM degree completion."
2503.12353,"In today's business landscape, organizations need to find the right balance between using their customers' data ethically to power AI solutions and being compliant regarding data privacy and data usage regulations. In this paper, we discuss synthetic data as a possible solution to this dilemma. Synthetic data is simulated data that mimics the real data. We explore how organizations in heavily regulated industries, such as financial institutions or healthcare organizations, can leverage synthetic data to build robust AI solutions while staying compliant. We demonstrate that synthetic data offers two significant advantages by allowing AI models to learn from more diverse data and by helping organizations stay compliant against data privacy laws with the use of synthetic data instead of customer information. We discuss case studies to show how synthetic data can be effectively used in the finance and healthcare sector while discussing the challenges of using synthetic data and some ethical questions it raises. Our research finds that synthetic data could be a game-changer for AI in regulated industries. The potential can be realized when industry, academia, and regulators collaborate to build solutions. We aim to initiate discussions on the use of synthetic data to build ethical, responsible, and effective AI systems in regulated enterprise industries."
2503.1264,"Software has the potential to improve lives. Yet, unethical and uninformed software practices are at the root of an increasing number of ethical concerns. Despite its pervasiveness, few research has analyzed end-users perspectives on the ethical issues of the software they use. We address this gap, and investigate end-user's ethical concerns in software through 19 semi-structured interviews with residents of the Netherlands. We ask a diverse group of users about their ethical concerns when using everyday software applications. We investigate the underlying reasons for their concerns and what solutions they propose to eliminate them. We find that our participants actively worry about privacy, transparency, manipulation, safety and inappropriate content; with privacy and manipulation often being at the center of their worries. Our participants demand software solutions to improve information clarity in applications and provide more control over the user experience. They further expect larger systematic changes within software practices and government regulation."
2503.13533,"As artificial intelligence (AI) technology becomes increasingly prevalent in the filed of education, there is a growing need for mathematics teacher education students (MTES) to demonstrate proficiency in the integration of AI with the technological pedagogical content knowledge (AI-TPACK). To study the issue, we firstly devised an systematic AI-TPACK scale and test on 412 MTES from seven universities. Through descriptive statistical analyses, we found that the current status of AI-TPACK for MTES in China is at a basic, preliminary stage. Secondly, we compared MTES between three different grades on the six variables and found that there is no discernible difference, which suggested that graduate studies were observed to have no promotion in the development of AI-TPACK competencies. Thirdly, we proposed a new AI-TPACK structural equation model (AI-TPACK-SEM) to explore the impact of self-efficacy and teaching beliefs on AI-TPACK. Our findings indicate a positive correlation between self-efficacy and AI-TPACK. We also come to a conclusion that may be contrary to common perception, excessive teaching beliefs may impede the advancement of AI-TPACK. Overall, this paper revealed the current status of AI-TPACK for MTES in China for the first time, designed a dedicated SEM to study the effect of specific factors on AI-TPACK, and proposed some suggestions on future developments."
2503.13535,"The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has brought about a notable surge in the field of education. The use of GAI to support learning is becoming increasingly prevalent among students. However, the manner and extent of its utilisation vary considerably from one individual to another. And researches about student's utilisation and perceptions of GAI remains relatively scarce. To gain insight into the issue, this paper proposed a hybrid-survey method to examine the impact of GAI on students across four different grades in six key areas (LIPSAL): learning interest, independent learning, problem solving, self-confidence, appropriate use, and learning enjoyment. Firstly, through questionnaire, we found that among LIPSAL, GAI has the greatest impact on the concept of appropriate use, the lowest level of learning interest and self-confidence. Secondly, a comparison of four grades revealed that the high and low factors of LIPSAL exhibited grade-related variation, and college students exhibited a higher level than high school students across LIPSAL. Thirdly, through interview, the students demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the application of GAI. We found that students have a positive attitude towards GAI and are very willing to use it, which is why GAI has grown so rapidly in popularity. They also told us prospects and challenges in using GAI. In the future, as GAI matures technologically, it will have an greater impact on students. These findings may help better understand usage by different students and inform future research in digital education."
2503.13554,"Many studies suggest that LLMs have left wing leans. The article extends previous analysis of US presidential elections considering several virtual elections in multiple European countries. The analysis considers multiple LLMs and the results confirm the extent of the leaning. Furthermore, the results show that the leaning is not uniform between countries. Sometimes, models refuse to take a position in the virtual elections, but the refusal rate itself is not uniform between countries."
2503.13556,"The early 2020s has seen the rise of two strange and potentially quite impactful social phenomena, namely pseudolaw, where users rely upon pseudolegal arguments that mimic the form and ritual of legal argumentation but fundamentally distort the content of law, and generative AI/LLMs, which generate content that uses probabilistic calculations to create outputs that look like human generated text. This article argues that the juxtaposition of the two phenomena helps to reveal that they both share two fundamental traits as both elevate form and appearance over substance and content, and users of both routinely mistake the form for the substance. In drawing upon legal theory, computer science, linguistics and cognitive psychology, the article argues that both phenomena rely upon creating illusions of meaning that users mistake for the underlying primary phenomenon. I then explore four implications of this conception of both phenomena. Firstly, both rely on human tendencies of conceptual pareidolia resulting in the erroneous perception of meaningful linguistic legal patterns from nebulous inputs. Secondly, both rely upon the confidence heuristic, the human cognitive bias for treating confidence as a proxy for competence. Thirdly, both succeed when the primary concern is with the form of the output and not its content. Fourthly, both rely heavily upon the magical thinking of users and the desire for the promise of the approach to be real. The article argues that the legal context helps to reveal a solution for the problems caused by both phenomena as it is only where users possess sufficient legal and technological literacy that it becomes possible to reveal to them the illusionary nature of the phenomena."
2503.1382,"This paper investigates the barriers hindering the effective transition from theoretical knowledge to practical application in a Sino-New Zealand double-degree undergraduate computing program. In this unique educational setting, students study at a campus in China but complete both Chinese and New Zealand courses taught jointly by lecturers from both countries. Through a questionnaire administered to these students, we identify critical obstacles such as insufficient foundational knowledge, language barriers, cultural and pedagogical differences, and difficulties adapting to distinct educational systems. Our analysis reveals that these barriers significantly affect students' academic performance, engagement, and skill development. Based on the findings, we propose targeted interventions, including specialized bridging courses, enhanced language support, refined teaching methods, and improved resource allocation."
2503.14519,"The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) has sparked significant debate over balancing the interests of creative rightsholders and AI developers. As GenAI models are trained on vast datasets that often include copyrighted material, questions around fair compensation and proper attribution have become increasingly urgent. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework called Content ARCs (Authenticity, Rights, Compensation). By combining open standards for provenance and dynamic licensing with data attribution, and decentralized technologies, Content ARCs create a mechanism for managing rights and compensating creators for using their work in AI training. We characterize several nascent works in the AI data licensing space within Content ARCs and identify where challenges remain to fully implement the end-to-end framework."
2503.14521,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances large language models (LLMs) by decomposing complex problems into step-by-step solutions, improving performance on reasoning tasks. However, current CoT disclosure policies vary widely across different models in frontend visibility, API access, and pricing strategies, lacking a unified policy framework. This paper analyzes the dual-edged implications of full CoT disclosure: while it empowers small-model distillation, fosters trust, and enables error diagnosis, it also risks violating intellectual property, enabling misuse, and incurring operational costs. We propose a tiered-access policy framework that balances transparency, accountability, and security by tailoring CoT availability to academic, business, and general users through ethical licensing, structured reasoning outputs, and cross-tier safeguards. By harmonizing accessibility with ethical and operational considerations, this framework aims to advance responsible AI deployment while mitigating risks of misuse or misinterpretation."
2503.14522,"We argue that there is a need for Accessibility to be represented in several important domains:- Capitalize on the new capabilities AI provides - Support for open source development of AI, which can allow disabled and disability focused professionals to contribute, including- Development of Accessibility Apps which help realise the promise of AI in accessibility domains- Open Source Model Development and Validation to ensure that accessibility concerns are addressed in these algorithms- Data Augmentation to include accessibility in data sets used to train models- Accessible Interfaces that allow disabled people to use any AI app, and to validate its outputs- Dedicated Functionality and Libraries that can make it easy to integrate AI support into a variety of settings and apps. - Data security and privacy and privacy risks including data collected by AI based accessibility technologies; and the possibility of disability disclosure. - Disability-specific AI risks and biases including both direct bias (during AI use by the disabled person) and indirect bias (when AI is used by someone else on data relating to a disabled person)."
2503.14527,"This study examines AI adoption among Finnish healthcare SMEs through semi-structured interviews with six health-tech companies. We identify three AI engagement categories: AI-curious (exploring AI), AI-embracing (integrating AI), and AI-catering (providing AI solutions). Our proposed threefold model highlights key adoption barriers, including regulatory complexities, technical expertise gaps, and financial constraints. While SMEs recognize AI's potential, most remain in early adoption stages. We provide actionable recommendations to accelerate AI integration, focusing on regulatory reforms, talent development, and inter-company collaboration, offering valuable insights for healthcare organizations, policymakers, and researchers."

2503.14541,"This article examines the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) regulation in financial services, detailing the legal frameworks and compliance challenges posed by rapid technological adoption. By reviewing current legislation, industry guidelines, and real-world use cases, it highlights how AI-driven processes, from fraud detection to algorithmic trading, offer efficiency gains yet introduce significant risks, including algorithmic bias, data privacy breaches, and lack of transparency in automated decision-making. The study compares regulatory approaches across major jurisdictions such as the European Union, United States, and United Kingdom, identifying both universal concerns, like the need for explainability and robust data protection, and region-specific compliance requirements that impact the implementation of high-risk AI applications. Additionally, it underscores emerging areas of focus, such as liability for AI-driven errors, systemic risks posed by interlinked AI systems, and the ethical considerations of technology-driven financial exclusion. The findings reveal gaps in existing rules and emphasize the necessity for adaptive, technology-neutral policies capable of fostering innovation while safeguarding consumer rights and market integrity. The article concludes by proposing a principled regulatory model that balances flexibility with enforceable standards, advocating closer collaboration between policymakers, financial institutions, and AI developers to ensure a secure, fair, and forward-looking framework for AI in finance."
2503.14543,"The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the aggravating biodiversity crisis have resulted in a research area where AI-based computational methods are being developed to act as allies in conservation, and the sustainable use and management of natural resources. While important general guidelines have been established globally regarding the opportunities and challenges that this interdisciplinary research offers, it is essential to generate local reflections from the specific contexts and realities of each region. Hence, this document aims to analyze the scope of this research area from a perspective focused on Colombia and the Neotropics. In this paper, we summarize the main experiences and debates that took place at the Humboldt Institute between 2023 and 2024 in Colombia. To illustrate the variety of promising opportunities, we present current uses such as automatic species identification from images and recordings, species modeling, and in silico bioprospecting, among others. From the experiences described above, we highlight limitations, challenges, and opportunities for in order to successfully implementate AI in conservation efforts and sustainable management of biological resources in the Neotropics. The result aims to be a guide for researchers, decision makers, and biodiversity managers, facilitating the understanding of how artificial intelligence can be effectively integrated into conservation and sustainable use strategies. Furthermore, it also seeks to open a space for dialogue on the development of policies that promote the responsible and ethical adoption of AI in local contexts, ensuring that its benefits are harnessed without compromising biodiversity or the cultural and ecosystemic values inherent in Colombia and the Neotropics."
2503.14803,"Constructing efficient risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for multiwinner single transferable vote (STV) elections is a challenging problem. An STV RLA is designed to statistically verify that the reported winners of an election did indeed win according to the voters' expressed preferences and not due to mistabulation or interference, while limiting the risk of accepting an incorrect outcome to a desired threshold (the risk limit). Existing methods have shown that it is possible to form RLAs for two-seat STV elections in the context where the first seat has been awarded to a candidate in the first round of tabulation. This is called the first winner criterion. We present an assertion-based approach to conducting full or partial RLAs for STV elections with three or more seats, in which the first winner criterion is satisfied. Although the chance of forming a full audit that verifies all winners drops substantially as the number of seats increases, we show that we can quite often form partial audits that verify most, and sometimes all, of the reported winners. We evaluate our method on a dataset of over 500 three- and four-seat STV elections from the 2017 and 2022 local council elections in Scotland."
2503.15182,"The extent to which foundation models can disclose novel chemical, biological, radiation, and nuclear (CBRN) threats to expert users is unclear due to a lack of test cases. I leveraged the unique opportunity presented by an upcoming publication describing a novel catastrophic biothreat - ""Technical Report on Mirror Bacteria: Feasibility and Risks"" - to conduct a small controlled study before it became public. Graduate-trained biologists tasked with predicting the consequences of releasing mirror E. coli showed no significant differences in rubric-graded accuracy using Claude Sonnet 3.5 new (n=10) or web search only (n=2); both groups scored comparably to a web baseline (28 and 43 versus 36). However, Sonnet reasoned correctly when prompted by a report author, but a smaller model, Haiku 3.5, failed even with author guidance (80 versus 5). These results suggest distinct stages of model capability: Haiku is unable to reason about mirror life even with threat-aware expert guidance (Stage 1), while Sonnet correctly reasons only with threat-aware prompting (Stage 2). Continued advances may allow future models to disclose novel CBRN threats to naive experts (Stage 3) or unskilled users (Stage 4). While mirror life represents only one case study, monitoring new models' ability to reason about privately known threats may allow protective measures to be implemented before widespread disclosure."
2503.15205,"This research examines the emerging technique of step-around prompt engineering in GenAI research, a method that deliberately bypasses AI safety measures to expose underlying biases and vulnerabilities in GenAI models. We discuss how Internet-sourced training data introduces unintended biases and misinformation into AI systems, which can be revealed through the careful application of step-around techniques.Drawing parallels with red teaming in cybersecurity, we argue that step-around prompting serves a vital role in identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities while acknowledging its dual nature as both a research tool and a potential security threat. Our findings highlight three key implications: (1) the persistence of Internet-derived biases in AI training data despite content filtering, (2) the effectiveness of step-around techniques in exposing these biases when used responsibly, and (3) the need for robust safeguards against malicious applications of these methods.We conclude by proposing an ethical framework for using step-around prompting in AI research and development, emphasizing the importance of balancing system improvements with security considerations."
2503.15364,"Three directions for the AI avant-garde are sketched against the background of time. Posthumanism changes what we are, and belongs to the radical future. Transhumanism changes how we are, and corresponds with the radical past. Genhumanism changes who we are, and exists in the radical present. While developing the concepts, this essay intersects in two ways with theoretical debates about humanism in the face of technological advance. First, it describes how temporal divisions may cleanly differentiate post- and transhumanism. Second, the essay introduces generative humanism, which contributes to discussions about AI and society by delineating a novel humanistic response to contemporary technology. Finally, grounds are provided for a practical project, one where philosophers work with AI engineers in the area of genhumanism. Contemporary AI research into serendipity in recommendation engines provides natural support for the shared research."
2503.15549,"Ensuring transparency in educational assessment is increasingly critical, particularly post-pandemic, as demand grows for fairer and more reliable evaluation methods. Comparative Judgement (CJ) offers a promising alternative to traditional assessments, yet concerns remain about its perceived opacity. This paper examines how Bayesian Comparative Judgement (BCJ) enhances transparency by integrating prior information into the judgement process, providing a structured, data-driven approach that improves interpretability and accountability.BCJ assigns probabilities to judgement outcomes, offering quantifiable measures of uncertainty and deeper insights into decision confidence. By systematically tracking how prior data and successive judgements inform final rankings, BCJ clarifies the assessment process and helps identify assessor disagreements. Multi-criteria BCJ extends this by evaluating multiple learning outcomes (LOs) independently, preserving the richness of CJ while producing transparent, granular rankings aligned with specific assessment goals. It also enables a holistic ranking derived from individual LOs, ensuring comprehensive evaluations without compromising detailed feedback.Using a real higher education dataset with professional markers in the UK, we demonstrate BCJ's quantitative rigour and ability to clarify ranking rationales. Through qualitative analysis and discussions with experienced CJ practitioners, we explore its effectiveness in contexts where transparency is crucial, such as high-stakes national assessments. We highlight the benefits and limitations of BCJ, offering insights into its real-world application across various educational settings."
2503.15682,"This article re-imagines the governance of artificial intelligence (AI) through a transfeminist lens, focusing on challenges of power, participation, and injustice, and on opportunities for advancing equity, community-based resistance, and transformative change. AI governance is a field of research and practice seeking to maximize benefits and minimize harms caused by AI systems. Unfortunately, AI governance practices are frequently ineffective at preventing AI systems from harming people and the environment, with historically marginalized groups such as trans people being particularly vulnerable to harm. Building upon trans and feminist theories of ethics, I introduce an approach to transfeminist AI governance. Applying a transfeminist lens in combination with a critical self-reflexivity methodology, I retroactively reinterpret findings from three empirical studies of AI governance practices in Canada and globally. In three reflections on my findings, I show that large-scale AI governance systems structurally prioritize the needs of industry over marginalized communities. As a result, AI governance is limited by power imbalances and exclusionary norms. This research shows that re-grounding AI governance in transfeminist ethical principles can support AI governance researchers, practitioners, and organizers in addressing those limitations."
2503.15684,"Various studies have studied the impact of Generative AI on Computing Education. However, they have focused on the implications for novice programmers. In this experience report, we analyze the use of GenAI as a support tool for learning, creativity, and productivity in a web development course for undergraduate students with extensive programming experience. We collected diverse data (assignments, reflections, logs, and a survey) and found that students used GenAI on different tasks (code generation, idea generation, etc.) with a reported increase in learning and productivity. However, they are concerned about over-reliance and incorrect solutions and want more training in prompting strategies."
2503.15896,"In recent years, the digitization and automation of anti-financial crime (AFC) investigative processes have faced significant challenges, particularly the need for interpretability of AI model results and the lack of labeled data for training. Network analysis has emerged as a valuable approach in this context.In this paper, we present WeirdFlows, a top-down search pipeline for detecting potentially fraudulent transactions and non-compliant agents. In a transaction network, fraud attempts are often based on complex transaction patterns that change over time to avoid detection. The WeirdFlows pipeline requires neither an a priori set of patterns nor a training set. In addition, by providing elements to explain the anomalies found, it facilitates and supports the work of an AFC analyst.We evaluate WeirdFlows on a dataset from Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP) bank, comprising 80 million cross-country transactions over 15 months, benchmarking our implementation of the algorithm. The results, corroborated by ISP AFC experts, highlight its effectiveness in identifying suspicious transactions and actors, particularly in the context of the economic sanctions imposed in the EU after February 2022. This demonstrates \textit{WeirdFlows}' capability to handle large datasets, detect complex transaction patterns, and provide the necessary interpretability for formal AFC investigations."
2503.16021,"Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have facilitated autonomous AI agents capable of imitating human-generated content. This technological advancement raises fundamental questions about AI's impact on the diversity and democratic value of information ecosystems. We introduce a large-scale simulation framework to examine AI-based imitation within news, a context crucial for public discourse. By systematically testing two distinct imitation strategies across a range of information environments varying in initial diversity, we demonstrate that AI-generated articles do not uniformly homogenize content. Instead, AI's influence is strongly context-dependent: AI-generated content can introduce valuable diversity in originally homogeneous news environments but diminish diversity in initially heterogeneous contexts. These results illustrate that the initial diversity of an information environment critically shapes AI's impact, challenging assumptions that AI-driven imitation threatens diversity. Instead, when information is initially homogeneous, AI-driven imitation can expand perspectives, styles, and topics. This is especially important in news contexts, where information diversity fosters richer public debate by exposing citizens to alternative viewpoints, challenging biases, and preventing narrative monopolies, which is essential for a resilient democracy."
2503.16104,"One approach to risk-limiting audits (RLAs) compares randomly selected cast vote records (CVRs) to votes read by human auditors from the corresponding ballot cards. Historically, such methods reduce audit sample sizes by considering how each sampled CVR differs from the corresponding true vote, not merely whether they differ. Here we investigate the latter approach, auditing by testing whether the total number of mismatches in the full set of CVRs exceeds the minimum number of CVR errors required for the reported outcome to be wrong (the ""CVR margin""). This strategy makes it possible to audit more social choice functions and simplifies RLAs conceptually, which makes it easier to explain than some other RLA approaches. The cost is larger sample sizes. ""Mismatch-based RLAs"" only require a lower bound on the CVR margin, which for some social choice functions is easier to calculate than the effect of particular errors. When the population rate of mismatches is low and the lower bound on the CVR margin is close to the true CVR margin, the increase in sample size is small. However, the increase may be very large when errors include errors that, if corrected, would widen the CVR margin rather than narrow it; errors affect the margin between candidates other than the reported winner with the fewest votes and the reported loser with the most votes; or errors that affect different margins."
2503.16137,"The rise of TikTok has brought forth novel ways to create and consume media content, accelerated by technologies such as hyper-individualised algorithms and easy-to-use video production tools. Despite its popularity, scholars and politicians alike have raised many concerns on the legitimacy and ethics of TikTok regarding its services, and its collected data. However, much of these discussions take the premise of user-generated content for granted, attributing them to human expression without critically evaluating how the making of on-platform content production have changed. With a grounded theory approach, in conjunction with a platform-aware walkthrough that pays special attention to the material and immaterial premises of platform value generation, my findings suggest that the intensification of datafication have proliferated from consumption behaviours to the process of content production, whereas content production no longer solely produce media content. As platforms become the active recruiter, mobiliser and co-producer of media production, I argue that it is no longer feasible to distinguish human and machine contribution in the ways they are consumed to facilitate platform valorisation. I propose that the technical arrangements of TikTok, in relation to its users has fostered a non-linear mode of platform cultural production capable of generating economic value through a system of machinic agency that incorporates human and machines in an indistinguishable manner. As content, the premises of platform valorisation has become an inseparable effort of human-machines, I urge that the relationship between technology and humans be reassessed as a system of machinic agency that mutually shapes our mediated reality, rather than singular, differentiable actors that contribute to platforms."
2503.16148,"Prompt-based language models like GPT4 and LLaMa have been used for a wide variety of use cases such as simulating agents, searching for information, or for content analysis. For all of these applications and others, political biases in these models can affect their performance. Several researchers have attempted to study political bias in language models using evaluation suites based on surveys, such as the Political Compass Test (PCT), often finding a particular leaning favored by these models. However, there is some variation in the exact prompting techniques, leading to diverging findings, and most research relies on constrained-answer settings to extract model responses. Moreover, the Political Compass Test is not a scientifically valid survey instrument. In this work, we contribute a political bias measured informed by political science theory, building on survey design principles to test a wide variety of input prompts, while taking into account prompt sensitivity. We then prompt 11 different open and commercial models, differentiating between instruction-tuned and non-instruction-tuned models, and automatically classify their political stances from 88,110 responses. Leveraging this dataset, we compute political bias profiles across different prompt variations and find that while PCT exaggerates bias in certain models like GPT3.5, measures of political bias are often unstable, but generally more left-leaning for instruction-tuned models.

2503.16304,"In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made significant breakthroughs in the field of natural language processing and has gradually been applied to the field of humanities and social sciences research. LLMs have a wide range of application value in the field of humanities and social sciences because of its strong text understanding, generation and reasoning capabilities. In humanities and social sciences research, LLMs can analyze large-scale text data and make inferences.This article analyzes the large language model DeepSeek-R1 from seven aspects: low-resource language translation, educational question-answering, student writing improvement in higher education, logical reasoning, educational measurement and psychometrics, public health policy analysis, and art education . Then we compare the answers given by DeepSeek-R1 in the seven aspects with the answers given by o1-preview. DeepSeek-R1 performs well in the humanities and social sciences, answering most questions correctly and logically, and can give reasonable analysis processes and explanations. Compared with o1-preview, it can automatically generate reasoning processes and provide more detailed explanations, which is suitable for beginners or people who need to have a detailed understanding of this knowledge, while o1-preview is more suitable for quick reading.Through analysis, it is found that LLM has broad application potential in the field of humanities and social sciences, and shows great advantages in improving text analysis efficiency, language communication and other fields. LLM's powerful language understanding and generation capabilities enable it to deeply explore complex problems in the field of humanities and social sciences, and provide innovative tools for academic research and practical applications."
2503.16431,"Red teaming has emerged as a critical practice in assessing the possible risks of AI models and systems. It aids in the discovery of novel risks, stress testing possible gaps in existing mitigations, enriching existing quantitative safety metrics, facilitating the creation of new safety measurements, and enhancing public trust and the legitimacy of AI risk assessments. This white paper describes OpenAI's work to date in external red teaming and draws some more general conclusions from this work. We describe the design considerations underpinning external red teaming, which include: selecting composition of red team, deciding on access levels, and providing guidance required to conduct red teaming. Additionally, we show outcomes red teaming can enable such as input into risk assessment and automated evaluations. We also describe the limitations of external red teaming, and how it can fit into a broader range of AI model and system evaluations. Through these contributions, we hope that AI developers and deployers, evaluation creators, and policymakers will be able to better design red teaming campaigns and get a deeper look into how external red teaming can fit into model deployment and evaluation processes. These methods are evolving and the value of different methods continues to shift as the ecosystem around red teaming matures and models themselves improve as tools for red teaming."
2503.16545,"Empathy is fundamental to human interactions, yet it remains unclear whether embodied agents can provide human-like empathetic support. Existing works have studied agents' tasks solving and social interactions abilities, but whether agents can understand empathetic needs and conduct empathetic behaviors remains overlooked. To address this, we introduce EmpathyAgent, the first benchmark to evaluate and enhance agents' empathetic actions across diverse scenarios. EmpathyAgent contains 10,000 multimodal samples with corresponding empathetic task plans and three different challenges. To systematically evaluate the agents' empathetic actions, we propose an empathy-specific evaluation suite that evaluates the agents' empathy process. We benchmark current models and found that exhibiting empathetic actions remains a significant challenge. Meanwhile, we train Llama3-8B using EmpathyAgent and find it can potentially enhance empathetic behavior. By establishing a standard benchmark for evaluating empathetic actions, we hope to advance research in empathetic embodied agents. Our code and data are publicly available atthis https URL."
2503.16557,"Qatar's football sector has undergone a substantial technological transformation with the implementation of Electronic Performance and Tracking Systems (EPTS). This study examines the impact of cultural and technological factors on EPTS adoption, using Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as theoretical frameworks. An initial exploratory study involved ten participants, followed by an expanded dataset comprising thirty stakeholders, including players, coaches, and staff from Qatari football organizations. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationships between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, power distance, innovation receptiveness, integration complexity, and overall adoption. The results indicate that perceived usefulness, innovation receptiveness, and lower power distance significantly drive EPTS adoption, while ease of use is marginally significant and integration complexity is non-significant in this sample. These findings provide practical insights for sports technology stakeholders in Qatar and emphasize the importance of aligning cultural considerations with technological readiness for successful EPTS integration."
2503.16558,"Problem-Based Learning (PBL) has significantly impacted biomedical engineering (BME) education since its introduction in the early 2000s, effectively enhancing critical thinking and real-world knowledge application among students. With biomedical engineering rapidly converging with artificial intelligence (AI), integrating effective AI education into established curricula has become challenging yet increasingly necessary. Recent advancements, including AI's recognition by the 2024 Nobel Prize, have highlighted the importance of training students comprehensively in biomedical AI. However, effective biomedical AI education faces substantial obstacles, such as diverse student backgrounds, limited personalized mentoring, constrained computational resources, and difficulties in safely scaling hands-on practical experiments due to privacy and ethical concerns associated with biomedical data. To overcome these issues, we conducted a three-year (2021-2023) case study implementing an advanced PBL framework tailored specifically for biomedical AI education, involving 92 undergraduate and 156 graduate students from the joint Biomedical Engineering program of Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University. Our approach emphasizes collaborative, interdisciplinary problem-solving through authentic biomedical AI challenges. The implementation led to measurable improvements in learning outcomes, evidenced by high research productivity (16 student-authored publications), consistently positive peer evaluations, and successful development of innovative computational methods addressing real biomedical challenges. Additionally, we examined the role of generative AI both as a teaching subject and an educational support tool within the PBL framework. Our study presents a practical and scalable roadmap for biomedical engineering departments aiming to integrate robust AI education into their curricula."
2503.16621,"The Rashomon set of equally-good models promises less discriminatory algorithms, reduced outcome homogenization, and fairer decisions through model ensembles or reconciliation. However, we argue from the perspective of allocation multiplicity that these promises may remain unfulfilled. When there are more qualified candidates than resources available, many different allocations of scarce resources can achieve the same utility. This space of equal-utility allocations may not be faithfully reflected by the Rashomon set, as we show in a case study of healthcare allocations. We attribute these unfulfilled promises to several factors: limitations in empirical methods for sampling from the Rashomon set, the standard practice of deterministically selecting individuals with the lowest risk, and structural biases that cause all equally-good models to view some qualified individuals as inherently risky."
2503.16625,"Digital system design lectures are mandatory in the electrical and electronics engineering curriculum. Besides HDL simulators and viewers, FPGA boards are necessary for the real implementation of HDL, which were previously costly for students. With the emergence of low-cost FPGA boards, the use of take-home labs is increasing. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated this process. Traditional lab sessions have limitations, prompting the exploration of take-home lab kits to enhance learning flexibility and engagement. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a low-cost take-home lab kit, consisting of a Tang Nano 9K FPGA board and a Saleae Logic Analyzer, in improving students' practical skills and sparking curiosity in digital system design. The research was conducted in the EEE 303 Digital Design lecture. Students used the Tang Nano 9K FPGA and Saleae Logic Analyzer for a term project involving PWM signal generation. Data was collected through a survey assessing the kit's impact on learning and engagement. Positive Acceptance: 75% of students agreed or strongly agreed that the take-home lab kit was beneficial. Preference for Lab Types: 60% of students preferred classical weekly lab hours over take-home labs. Increased Curiosity: 65% of students conducted additional, unassigned experiments, indicating heightened interest and engagement. The take-home lab kit effectively aids in learning practical aspects of digital system design and stimulates curiosity, though some students prefer traditional lab sessions for group work."
2503.16679,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating human-like text, transforming human-machine interactions. However, their widespread adoption has raised concerns about their potential to influence public opinion and shape political narratives. In this work, we investigate the geopolitical biases in US and Chinese LLMs, focusing on how these models respond to questions related to geopolitics and international relations. We collected responses from ChatGPT and DeepSeek to a set of geopolitical questions and evaluated their outputs through both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Our findings show notable biases in both models, reflecting distinct ideological perspectives and cultural influences. However, despite these biases, for a set of questions, the models' responses are more aligned than expected, indicating that they can address sensitive topics without necessarily presenting directly opposing viewpoints. This study highlights the potential of LLMs to shape public discourse and underscores the importance of critically assessing AI-generated content, particularly in politically sensitive contexts."
2503.16993,"Heat pumps are essential for decarbonizing residential heating but consume substantial electrical energy, impacting operational costs and grid demand. Many systems run inefficiently due to planning flaws, operational faults, or misconfigurations. While optimizing performance requires skilled professionals, labor shortages hinder large-scale interventions. However, digital tools and improved data availability create new service opportunities for energy efficiency, predictive maintenance, and demand-side management. To support research and practical solutions, we present an open-source dataset of electricity consumption from 1,408 households with heat pumps and smart electricity meters in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, recorded at 15-minute and daily resolutions between 2018-11-03 and 2024-03-21. The dataset includes household metadata, weather data from 8 stations, and ground truth data from 410 field visit protocols collected by energy consultants during system optimizations. Additionally, the dataset includes a Python-based data loader to facilitate seamless data processing and exploration."
2503.17246,"Decentralization is understood both by professionals in the blockchain industry and general users as a core design goal of permissionless ledgers. However, its meaning is far from universally agreed, and often it is easier to get opinions on what it is not, rather than what it is. In this paper, we solicit definitions of 'decentralization' and 'decentralization theatre' from blockchain node operators. Key to a definition is asking about effective decentralization strategies, as well as those that are ineffective. Malicious, deceptive, or incompetent strategies are commonly referred to by the term 'decentralization theatre.' Finally, we ask what is being decentralized. Via thematic analysis of interview transcripts, we find that most operators conceive of decentralization as existing broadly on a technical and a governance axis. This informs a two-axis model: network topology and governance topology, or the structure of decision-making power. Our key finding is that `decentralization' alone does not affect ledger immutability or systemic robustness."
2503.17339,"The legislative process is the backbone of a state built on solid institutions. Yet, due to the complexity of laws -- particularly tax law -- policies may lead to inequality and social tensions. In this study, we introduce a novel prototype system designed to address the issues of tax loopholes and tax avoidance. Our hybrid solution integrates a natural language interface with a domain-specific language tailored for planning. We demonstrate on a case study how tax loopholes and avoidance schemes can be exposed. We conclude that our prototype can help enhance social welfare by systematically identifying and addressing tax gaps stemming from loopholes."
2503.17374,"In this paper we introduce a Platform created in order to support SMEs' endeavor to extract value from their intangible assets effectively. To implement the Platform, we developed five knowledge bases using a knowledge-based ex-pert system shell that contain knowledge from intangible as-set consultants, patent attorneys and due diligence lawyers. In order to operationalize the knowledge bases, we developed a ""Rosetta Stone"", an interpreter unit for the knowledge bases outside the shell and embedded in the plat-form. Building on the initial knowledge bases we have created a system of red flags, risk scoring, and valuation with the involvement of the same experts; these additional systems work upon the initial knowledge bases and therefore they can be regarded as meta-knowledge-representations that take the form of second-order knowledge graphs. All this clever technology is dressed up in an easy-to-handle graphical user interface that we will showcase at the conference. The initial platform was finished mid-2024; therefore, it qualifies as an ""emerging application of AI"" and ""deployable AI"", while development continues. The two firms that provided experts for developing the knowledge bases obtained a white-label version of the product (i.e. it runs under their own brand ""powered by Intanify""), and there are two completed cases."
2503.17388,"The rapid advancement of AI systems has raised widespread concerns about potential harms of frontier AI systems and the need for responsible evaluation and oversight. In this position paper, we argue that frontier AI companies should report both pre- and post-mitigation safety evaluations to enable informed policy decisions. Evaluating models at both stages provides policymakers with essential evidence to regulate deployment, access, and safety standards. We show that relying on either in isolation can create a misleading picture of model safety. Our analysis of AI safety disclosures from leading frontier labs identifies three critical gaps: (1) companies rarely evaluate both pre- and post-mitigation versions, (2) evaluation methods lack standardization, and (3) reported results are often too vague to inform policy. To address these issues, we recommend mandatory disclosure of pre- and post-mitigation capabilities to approved government bodies, standardized evaluation methods, and minimum transparency requirements for public safety reporting. These ensure that policymakers and regulators can craft targeted safety measures, assess deployment risks, and scrutinize companies' safety claims effectively."
2503.17401,"This paper introduces AIJIM, the Artificial Intelligence Journalism Integration Model -- a novel framework for integrating real-time AI into environmental journalism. AIJIM combines Vision Transformer-based hazard detection, crowdsourced validation with 252 validators, and automated reporting within a scalable, modular architecture. A dual-layer explainability approach ensures ethical transparency through fast CAM-based visual overlays and optional LIME-based box-level interpretations. Validated in a 2024 pilot on the island of Mallorca using the NamicGreen platform, AIJIM achieved 85.4\% detection accuracy and 89.7\% agreement with expert annotations, while reducing reporting latency by 40\%. Unlike conventional approaches such as Data-Driven Journalism or AI Fact-Checking, AIJIM provides a transferable model for participatory, community-driven environmental reporting, advancing journalism, artificial intelligence, and sustainability in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the EU AI Act."
2503.17414,"Synthetic data, or data generated by machine learning models, is increasingly emerging as a solution to the data access problem. However, its use introduces significant governance and accountability challenges, and potentially debases existing governance paradigms, such as compute and data governance. In this paper, we identify 3 key governance and accountability challenges that synthetic data poses - it can enable the increased emergence of malicious actors, spontaneous biases and value drift. We thus craft 3 technical mechanisms to address these specific challenges, finding applications for synthetic data towards adversarial training, bias mitigation and value reinforcement. These could not only counteract the risks of synthetic data, but serve as critical levers for governance of the frontier in the future."
2503.17421,"Patients are increasingly turning to online health Q&A communities for social support to improve their well-being. However, when this support received does not align with their specific needs, it may prove ineffective or even detrimental. This necessitates a model capable of identifying the social support needs in questions. However, training such a model is challenging due to the scarcity and class imbalance issues of labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we follow the computational design science paradigm to develop a novel framework, Hybrid Approach for SOcial Support need classification (HA-SOS). HA-SOS integrates an answer-enhanced semi-supervised learning approach, a text data augmentation technique leveraging large language models (LLMs) with reliability- and diversity-aware sample selection mechanism, and a unified training process to automatically label social support needs in questions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that HA-SOS significantly outperforms existing question classification models and alternative semi-supervised learning approaches. This research contributes to the literature on social support, question classification, semi-supervised learning, and text data augmentation. In practice, our HA-SOS framework facilitates online Q&A platform managers and answerers to better understand users' social support needs, enabling them to provide timely, personalized answers and interventions."
2503.17424,"Among the factors of production, human capital or skilled manpower is the one that keeps evolving and adapts to changing conditions and resources. This adaptability makes human capital the most crucial factor in ensuring a sustainable growth of industry/sector. As new technologies are developed and adopted, the new generations are required to acquire skills in newer technologies in order to be employable. At the same time professionals are required to upskill and reskill themselves to remain relevant in the industry. There is however no straightforward method to identify the skill needs of the industry at a given point of time. Therefore, this paper proposes a data to decision framework that can successfully identify the desired skill set in a given area by analysing the advertorial data collected from popular online job portals and supplied as input to the framework. The proposed framework uses techniques of statistical analysis, data mining and natural language processing for the purpose. The applicability of the framework is demonstrated on CS&IT job advertisement data from India. The analytical results not only provide useful insights about current state of skill needs in CS&IT industry but also provide practical implications to prospective job applicants, training agencies, and institutions of higher education & professional training."
2503.17428,"Data mining is not an invasion of privacy because access to data is only by machines, not by people: this is the argument that is investigated here. The current importance of this problem is developed in a case study of data mining in the USA for counterterrorism and other surveillance purposes. After a clarification of the relevant nature of privacy, it is argued that access by machines cannot warrant the access to further information, since the analysis will have to be made either by humans or by machines that understand. It concludes that the current data mining violates the right to privacy and should be subject to the standard legal constraints for access to private information by people."
2503.17438,"The recruitment process is undergoing a significant transformation with the increasing use of machine learning and natural language processing techniques. While previous studies have focused on automating candidate selection, the role of multiple vacancies in this process remains understudied. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel pipeline that leverages Large Language Models and graph similarity measures to suggest ideal candidates for specific job openings. Our approach represents candidate profiles as multimodal embeddings, enabling the capture of nuanced relationships between job requirements and candidate attributes. The proposed approach has significant implications for the recruitment industry, enabling companies to streamline their hiring processes and identify top talent more efficiently. Our work contributes to the growing body of research on the application of machine learning in human resources, highlighting the potential of LLMs and graph-based methods in revolutionizing the recruitment landscape."
2503.17457,"Conspicuous consumption occurs when a consumer derives value from a good based on its social meaning as a signal of wealth, taste, and/or community affiliation. Common conspicuous goods include designer footwear, country club memberships, and artwork; conspicuous goods also exist in the digital sphere, with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a prominent example. The NFT market merits deeper study for two key reasons: first, it is poorly understood relative to its economic scale; and second, it is unusually amenable to analysis because NFT transactions are publicly available on the blockchain, making them useful as a test bed for conspicuous consumption dynamics. This paper introduces a model that incorporates two previously identified elements of conspicuous consumption: the \emph{bandwagon effect} (goods increase in value as they become more popular) and the \emph{snob effect} (goods increase in value as they become rarer). Our model resolves the apparent tension between these two effects, exhibiting net complementarity between others' and one's own conspicuous consumption. We also introduce a novel dataset combining NFT transactions with embeddings of the corresponding NFT images computed using an off-the-shelf vision transformer architecture. We use our dataset to validate the model, showing that the bandwagon effect raises an NFT collection's value as more consumers join, while the snob effect drives consumers to seek rarer NFTs within a given collection."
2503.17476,"Efforts to promote equity in higher education often rely on shared intent among instructors and students. Yet, as demonstrated in this study, when students form their own teams for Team-Based Learning (TBL) tasks, they unintentionally cluster with peers of similar socio-economic backgrounds, ultimately undermining equity. This study introduces a simple strategy to facilitate equitable team formation through a quantitative reflection of students' socio-economic backgrounds and their self-perceived preparedness. When applied, the strategy yielded balanced teams and improved performance. In its absence, team compositions became skewed and class performance declined. These findings highlight a behavioural gap between intent and outcome and underscore the need for structural supports to translate equity goals into practice."
2503.17661,"Adopting AI copilots in professional workflows presents opportunities for enhanced productivity, efficiency, and decision making. In this paper, we present results from a six month trial of M365 Copilot conducted at our organisation in 2024. A qualitative interview study was carried out with 27 participants. The study explored user perceptions of M365 Copilot's effectiveness, productivity impact, evolving expectations, ethical concerns, and overall satisfaction. Initial enthusiasm for the tool was met with mixed post trial experiences. While some users found M365 Copilot beneficial for tasks such as email coaching, meeting summaries, and content retrieval, others reported unmet expectations in areas requiring deeper contextual understanding, reasoning, and integration with existing workflows. Ethical concerns were a recurring theme, with users highlighting issues related to data privacy, transparency, and AI bias. While M365 Copilot demonstrated value in specific operational areas, its broader impact remained constrained by usability limitations and the need for human oversight to validate AI generated outputs."
2503.17702,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently considered a sustainability ""game-changer"" within and outside of academia. In order to discuss sustainable AI this article draws from insights by critical data and algorithm studies, STS, transformative sustainability science, critical computer science, and public interest theory. I argue that while there are indeed many sustainability-related use cases for AI, they are likely to have more overall drawbacks than benefits. To substantiate this claim, I differentiate three 'AI materialities' of the AI supply chain: first the literal materiality (e.g. water, cobalt, lithium, energy consumption etc.), second, the informational materiality (e.g. lots of data and centralised control necessary), and third, the social materiality (e.g. exploitative data work, communities harm by waste and pollution). In all materialities, effects are especially devastating for the global south while benefiting the global north. A second strong claim regarding sustainable AI circles around so called apolitical optimisation (e.g. regarding city traffic), however the optimisation criteria (e.g. cars, bikes, emissions, commute time, health) are purely political and have to be collectively negotiated before applying AI optimisation. Hence, sustainable AI, in principle, cannot break the glass ceiling of transformation and might even distract from necessary societal change. To address that I propose to stop 'unformation gathering' and to apply the 'small is beautiful' principle. This aims to contribute to an informed academic and collective negotiation on how to (not) integrate AI into the sustainability project while avoiding to reproduce the status quo by serving hegemonic interests between useful AI use cases, techno-utopian salvation narratives, technology-centred efficiency paradigms, the exploitative and extractivist character of AI and concepts of digital degrowth."
2503.17976,"Interpersonal trust is recognized as one of the pillars of collaboration and successful learning among students in virtual learning environments (VLEs). This systematic mapping study investigates attributes, phases, and features that support interpersonal trust among students in VLEs. Analyzing 46 articles, we identified 37 attributes that influence phases of acquiring and losing trust, categorized into four themes: Ability, Integrity, Affinity, and Non-Personal Factors. Attributes such as collaborative and ethical behavior, academic skills, and higher grades are often used to select peers, mainly through recommendation systems and user profiles. To organize our findings, we elaborated two conceptual maps describing the main characteristics of trust definitions and the attributes classification by phases and themes."
2503.18119,"Understanding food acquisition is crucial for developing strategies to combat food insecurity, a major public health concern. The emergence of large-scale mobile location data (typically exemplified by GPS data), which captures people's movement over time at high spatiotemporal resolutions, offer a new approach to study this topic. This paper evaluates the potential and limitations of large-scale GPS data for food acquisition analysis through a case study. Using a high-resolution dataset of 286 million GPS records from individuals in Jacksonville, Florida, we conduct a case study to assess the strengths of GPS data in capturing spatiotemporal patterns of food outlet visits while also discussing key limitations, such as potential data biases and algorithmic uncertainties. Our findings confirm that GPS data can generate valuable insights about food acquisition behavior but may significantly underestimate visitation frequency to food outlets. Robustness checks highlight how algorithmic choices-especially regarding food outlet classification and visit identification-can influence research results. Our research underscores the value of GPS data in place-based health studies while emphasizing the need for careful consideration of data coverage, representativeness, algorithmic choices, and the broader implications of study findings."
2503.18156,"AI-generated images have become so good in recent years that individuals often cannot distinguish them any more from ""real"" images. This development, combined with the rapid spread of AI-generated content online, creates a series of societal risks. Watermarking, a technique that involves embedding information within images and other content to indicate their AI-generated nature, has emerged as a primary mechanism to address the risks posed by AI-generated content. Indeed, watermarking and AI labelling measures are now becoming a legal requirement in many jurisdictions, including under the 2024 European Union AI Act. Despite the widespread use of AI image generation systems, the practical implications and the current status of implementation of these measures remain largely unexamined. The present paper therefore provides both an empirical and a legal analysis of these measures. In our legal analysis, we identify four categories of generative AI deployment scenarios and outline how the legal obligations could apply in each category. In our empirical analysis, we find that only a minority number of AI image generators currently implement adequate watermarking (38%) and deep fake labelling (18%) practices. In response, we suggest a range of avenues of how the implementation of these legally mandated techniques can be improved, and publicly share our tooling for the detection of watermarks in images."
2503.18238,"To uncover how AI agents change productivity, performance, and work processes, we introduce Pairit -- an experimentation platform enabling humans and AI agents to collaborate in integrative workspaces. In a large-scale marketing experiment on the platform, 2310 participants were randomly assigned to human-human and human-AI teams. The teams exchanged 183,691 messages and created 63,656 image edits, 1,960,095 ad copy edits, and 10,375 AI-generated images while producing 11,138 ads for a large think tank. Analysis of fine-grained communication, collaboration, and workflow logs revealed that collaborating with AI agents increased communication by 63% and allowed humans to engage in 71% less direct text editing. While human-AI teams engaged in 18% more process and content communication, human-human teams engaged in 29% more social and emotional communication. Humans in human-AI teams experienced 73% greater productivity per worker and produced higher-quality ad copy, while human-human teams produced higher-quality images, suggesting AI agents require fine-tuning for multimodal workflows. Field tests of the ad campaigns accumulated ~5M ad impressions and revealed that ads with higher image quality (produced by human-human collaborations) and higher text quality (produced by human-AI collaborations) performed significantly better on click-through rates, view through rates, and cost per click metrics. Together, these results suggest that human collaboration with AI agents significantly reshapes communication patterns and work processes and increases productivity, while improving some dimensions of output quality and deteriorating others. We hope the release of the extensible Pairit platform will accelerate RCTs of human-AI collaboration across a variety of work tasks and contexts."
2503.18387,"Large Language Model chatbots are increasingly taking the form and visage of human beings, adapting human faces, names, voices, personalities, and quirks, including those of celebrities and well-known political figures. Personifying AI chatbots could foreseeably increase their trust with users. However, it could also make them more capable of manipulation, by creating the illusion of a close and intimate relationship with an artificial entity. The European Commission has finalized the AI Act, with the EU Parliament making amendments banning manipulative and deceptive AI systems that cause significant harm to users. Although the AI Act covers harms that accumulate over time, it is unlikely to prevent harms associated with prolonged discussions with AI chatbots. Specifically, a chatbot could reinforce a person's negative emotional state over weeks, months, or years through negative feedback loops, prolonged conversations, or harmful recommendations, contributing to a user's deteriorating mental health."
2503.18724,"The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents unprecedented opportunities and challenges for journalism, fact-checking and media regulation. While AI offers tools to combat disinformation and enhance media practices, its unregulated use and associated risks necessitate clear policies and collaborative efforts. This policy paper explores the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) for journalism and fact-checking, with a focus on addressing disinformation and fostering responsible AI integration. Using Germany and Ukraine as key case studies, it identifies the challenges posed by disinformation, proposes regulatory and funding strategies, and outlines technical standards to enhance AI adoption in media. The paper offers actionable recommendations to ensure AI's responsible and effective integration into media ecosystems. AI presents significant opportunities to combat disinformation and enhance journalistic practices. However, its implementation lacks cohesive regulation, leading to risks such as bias, transparency issues, and over-reliance on automated systems. In Ukraine, establishing an independent media regulatory framework adapted to its governance is crucial, while Germany can act as a leader in advancing EU-wide collaborations and standards. Together, these efforts can shape a robust AI-driven media ecosystem that promotes accuracy and trust."
2503.18842,"There is an overwhelming abundance of works in AI Ethics. This growth is chaotic because of how sudden it is, its volume, and its multidisciplinary nature. This makes difficult to keep track of debates, and to systematically characterize goals, research questions, methods, and expertise required by AI ethicists. In this article, I show that the relation between AI and ethics can be characterized in at least three ways, which correspond to three well-represented kinds of AI ethics: ethics and AI; ethics in AI; ethics of AI. I elucidate the features of these three kinds of AI Ethics, characterize their research questions, and identify the kind of expertise that each kind needs. I also show how certain criticisms to AI ethics are misplaced, as being done from the point of view of one kind of AI ethics, to another kind with different goals. All in all, this work sheds light on the nature of AI ethics, and sets the groundwork for more informed discussions about the scope, methods, and training of AI ethicists."
2503.18952,"The United States risks losing its global leadership in information technology research due to declining basic research funding, challenges in attracting talent, and tensions between research security and openness."
2503.18956,"The malicious use or malfunction of advanced general-purpose AI (GPAI) poses risks that, according to leading experts, could lead to the 'marginalisation or extinction of humanity.' To address these risks, there are an increasing number of proposals for international agreements on AI safety. In this paper, we review recent (2023-) proposals, identifying areas of consensus and disagreement, and drawing on related literature to assess their feasibility. We focus our discussion on risk thresholds, regulations, types of international agreement and five related processes: building scientific consensus, standardisation, auditing, verification and incentivisation.Based on this review, we propose a treaty establishing a compute threshold above which development requires rigorous oversight. This treaty would mandate complementary audits of models, information security and governance practices, overseen by an international network of AI Safety Institutes (AISIs) with authority to pause development if risks are unacceptable. Our approach combines immediately implementable measures with a flexible structure that can adapt to ongoing research."
2503.18976,"This paper develops a critical theory of artificial intelligence, within a historical constellation where computational systems increasingly generate cultural content that destabilises traditional distinctions between human and machine production. Through this analysis, I introduce the concept of the algorithmic condition, a cultural moment when machine-generated work not only becomes indistinguishable from human creation but actively reshapes our understanding of ideas of authenticity. This transformation, I argue, moves beyond false consciousness towards what I call post-consciousness, where the boundaries between individual and synthetic consciousness become porous. Drawing on critical theory and extending recent work on computational ideology, I develop three key theoretical contributions, first, the concept of the Inversion to describe a new computational turn in algorithmic society; second, automimetric production as a framework for understanding emerging practices of automated value creation; and third, constellational analysis as a methodological approach for mapping the complex interplay of technical systems, cultural forms and political economic structures. Through these contributions, I argue that we need new critical methods capable of addressing both the technical specificity of AI systems and their role in restructuring forms of life under computational capitalism. The paper concludes by suggesting that critical reflexivity is needed to engage with the algorithmic condition without being subsumed by it and that it represents a growing challenge for contemporary critical theory."
2503.18979,"We analyse circumstances in which bifurcation-driven jumps in AI systems are associated with emergent heavy-tailed outcome distributions. By analysing how a control parameter's random fluctuations near a catastrophic threshold generate extreme outcomes, we demonstrate in what circumstances the probability of a sudden, large-scale, transition aligns closely with the tail probability of the resulting damage distribution. Our results contribute to research in monitoring, mitigation and control of AI systems when seeking to manage potentially catastrophic AI risk."
2503.18983,"While artificial intelligence (AI) holds enormous promise, many experts in the field are warning that there is a non-trivial chance that the development of AI poses an existential threat to humanity. Existing regulatory initiative do not address this threat but merely instead focus on discrete AI-related risks such as consumer safety, cybersecurity, data protection, and privacy. In the absence of regulatory action to address the possible risk of human extinction by AI, the question arises: What legal obligations, if any, does public international law impose on states to regulate its development. Grounded in the precautionary principle, we argue that there exists an international obligation to mitigate the threat of human extinction by AI. Often invoked in relation to environmental regulation and the regulation of potentially harmful technologies, the principle holds that in situations where there is the potential for significant harm, even in the absence of full scientific certainty, preventive measures should not be postponed if delayed action may result in irreversible consequences. We argue that the precautionary principle is a general principle of international law and, therefore, that there is a positive obligation on states under the right to life within international human rights law to proactively take regulatory action to mitigate the potential existential risk of AI. This is significant because, if an international obligation to regulate the development of AI can be established under international law, then the basic legal framework would be in place to address this evolving threat."
2503.18994,"This paper introduces the HH4AI Methodology, a structured approach to assessing the impact of AI systems on human rights, focusing on compliance with the EU AI Act and addressing technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges. The paper highlights AIs transformative nature, driven by autonomy, data, and goal-oriented design, and how the EU AI Act promotes transparency, accountability, and safety. A key challenge is defining and assessing ""high-risk"" AI systems across industries, complicated by the lack of universally accepted standards and AIs rapid evolution.To address these challenges, the paper explores the relevance of ISO/IEC and IEEE standards, focusing on risk management, data quality, bias mitigation, and governance. It proposes a Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA) methodology, a gate-based framework designed to isolate and assess risks through phases including an AI system overview, a human rights checklist, an impact assessment, and a final output phase. A filtering mechanism tailors the assessment to the system's characteristics, targeting areas like accountability, AI literacy, data governance, and transparency.The paper illustrates the FRIA methodology through a fictional case study of an automated healthcare triage service. The structured approach enables systematic filtering, comprehensive risk assessment, and mitigation planning, effectively prioritizing critical risks and providing clear remediation strategies. This promotes better alignment with human rights principles and enhances regulatory compliance."
2503.18995,"We randomly deploy questions constructed with and without use of the LLM tool and gauge the ability of the students to correctly answer, as well as their ability to correctly perceive the difference between human-authored and LLM-authored questions. In determining whether the questions written with the aid of ChatGPT were consistent with the instructor's questions and source text, we computed representative vectors of both the human and ChatGPT questions using SBERT and compared cosine similarity to the course textbook. A non-significant Mann-Whitney U test (z = 1.018, p = .309) suggests that students were unable to perceive whether questions were written with or without the aid of ChatGPT. However, student scores on LLM-authored questions were almost 9% lower (z = 2.702, p < .01). This result may indicate that either the AI questions were more difficult or that the students were more familiar with the instructor's style of questions. Overall, the study suggests that while there is potential for using LLM tools to aid in the construction of assessments, care must be taken to ensure that the questions are fair, well-composed, and relevant to the course material."
2503.19006,"Developing competency in artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly crucial for computer science (CS) students at all levels of the CS curriculum. However, most previous research focuses on advanced CS courses, as traditional introductory courses provide limited opportunities to develop AI skills and knowledge. This paper introduces an introductory CS course where students learn computational thinking through computer vision, a sub-field of AI, as an application context. The course aims to achieve computational thinking outcomes alongside critical thinking outcomes that expose students to AI approaches and their societal implications. Through experiential activities such as individual projects and reading discussions, our course seeks to balance technical learning and critical thinking goals. Our evaluation, based on pre-and post-course surveys, shows an improved sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and AI ethics awareness among students. The results suggest that an AI-focused context can enhance participation and employability, student-selected projects support self-efficacy, and ethically grounded AI instruction can be effective for interdisciplinary audiences. Students' discussions on reading assignments demonstrated deep engagement with the complex challenges in today's AI landscape. Finally, we share insights on scaling such courses for larger cohorts and improving the learning experience for introductory CS students."
2503.19075,"Generative AI image models have been increasingly evaluated for their (in)ability to represent non-Western cultures. We argue that these evaluations operate through reductive ideals of representation, abstracted from how people define their own representation and neglecting the inherently interpretive and contextual nature of cultural representation. In contrast to these 'thin' evaluations, we introduce the idea of 'thick evaluations': a more granular, situated, and discursive measurement framework for evaluating representations of social worlds in AI images, steeped in communities' own understandings of representation. We develop this evaluation framework through workshops in South Asia, by studying the 'thick' ways in which people interpret and assign meaning to images of their own cultures. We introduce practices for thicker evaluations of representation that expand the understanding of representation underpinning AI evaluations and by co-constructing metrics with communities, bringing measurement in line with the experiences of communities on the ground."
2503.19655,"Online tracking remains problematic, with compliance and ethical issues persisting despite regulatory efforts. Consent interfaces, the visible manifestation of this industry, have seen significant attention over the years. We present robust automated methods to study the presence, design, and third-party suppliers of consent interfaces at scale and the web servicethis http URLto do it with. We examine the top 10,000 websites across 31 countries under the ePrivacy Directive and GDPR (n=254.148). Our findings show that 67% of websites use consent interfaces, but only 15% are minimally compliant, mostly because they lack a reject option. Consent management platforms (CMPs) are powerful intermediaries in this space: 67% of interfaces are provided by CMPs, and three organisations hold 37% of the market. There is little evidence that regulators' guidance and fines have impacted compliance rates, but 18% of compliance variance is explained by CMPs. Researchers should take an infrastructural perspective on online tracking and study the factual control of intermediaries to identify effective leverage points."
2503.19887,"Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure, or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and present a timely proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regime that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe sectors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that 'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of the proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident' and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security."
2503.20099,"This study examines how AI identity influences psychological empowerment and unethical AI behavior among college students, while also exploring the moderating role of IT mindfulness. Findings show that a strong AI identity enhances psychological empowerment and academic engagement but can also lead to increased unethical AI practices. Crucially, IT mindfulness acts as an ethical safeguard, promoting sensitivity to ethical concerns and reducing misuse of AI. These insights have implications for educators, policymakers, and AI developers, emphasizing For Peer Review the need for a balanced approach that encourages digital engagement without compromising student responsibility. The study also contributes to philosophical discussions of psychological agency, suggesting that empowerment through AI can yield both positive and negative outcomes. Mindfulness emerges as essential in guiding ethical AI interactions. Overall, the research informs ongoing debates on ethics in education and AI, offering strategies to align technological advancement with ethical accountability and responsible use."

2503.20986,"This paper contributes a new way to evaluate AI. Much as one might evaluate a machine in terms of its performance at chess, this approach involves evaluating a machine in terms of its performance at a game called ""MAD Chairs"". At the time of writing, evaluation with this game exposed opportunities to improve Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Qwen and DeepSeek. Furthermore, this paper sets a stage for future innovation in game theory and AI safety by providing an example of success with non-standard approaches to each: studying a game beyond the scope of previous game theoretic tools and mitigating a serious AI safety risk in a way that requires neither determination of values nor their enforcement."
2503.20989,"Fine-grained migration data illuminate important demographic, environmental, and health phenomena. However, migration datasets within the United States remain lacking: publicly available Census data are neither spatially nor temporally granular, and proprietary data have higher resolution but demographic and other biases. To address these limitations, we develop a scalable iterative-proportional-fitting based method that reconciles high-resolution but biased proprietary data with low-resolution but more reliable Census data. We apply this method to produce MIGRATE, a dataset of annual migration matrices from 2010 - 2019 that captures flows between 47.4 billion pairs of Census Block Groups -- about four thousand times more granular than publicly available data. These estimates are highly correlated with external ground-truth datasets, and improve accuracy and reduce bias relative to raw proprietary data. We use MIGRATE to analyze both national and local migration patterns. Nationally, we document temporal and demographic variation in homophily, upward mobility, and moving distance: for example, we find that people are increasingly likely to move to top-income-quartile CBGs and identify racial disparities in upward mobility. We also show that MIGRATE can illuminate important local migration patterns, including out-migration in response to California wildfires, that are invisible in coarser previous datasets. We publicly release MIGRATE to provide a resource for migration research in the social, environmental, and health sciences."
2503.21162,"This study examined the temporal aspect of COVID-19-related health-seeking behavior in Metro Manila, National Capital Region, Philippines through a network density analysis of Google Trends data. A total of 15 keywords across five categories (English symptoms, Filipino symptoms, face wearing, quarantine, and new normal) were examined using both 15-day and 30-day rolling windows from March 2020 to March 2021. The methodology involved constructing network graphs using distance correlation coefficients at varying thresholds (0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8) and analyzing the time-series data of network density and clustering coefficients. Results revealed three key findings: (1) an inverse relationship between the threshold values and network metrics, indicating that higher thresholds provide more meaningful keyword relationships; (2) exceptionally high network connectivity during the initial pandemic months followed by gradual decline; and (3) distinct patterns in keyword relationships, transitioning from policy-focused searches to more symptom-specific queries as the pandemic temporally progressed. The 30-day window analysis showed more stable, but less search activities compared to the 15-day windows, suggesting stronger correlations in immediate search behaviors. These insights are helpful for health communication because it emphasizes the need of a strategic and conscientious information dissemination from the government or the private sector based on the networked search behavior (e.g. prioritizing to inform select symptoms rather than an overview of what the coronavirus is)."
2503.21497,"This study examines behavioral responses to mobile phone evacuation alerts during the February 2024 wildfires in Valparaíso, Chile. Using anonymized mobile network data from 580,000 devices, we analyze population movement following emergency SMS notifications. Results reveal three key patterns: (1) initial alerts trigger immediate evacuation responses with connectivity dropping by 80\% within 1.5 hours, while subsequent messages show diminishing effects; (2) substantial evacuation also occurs in non-warned areas, indicating potential transportation congestion; (3) socioeconomic disparities exist in evacuation timing, with high-income areas evacuating faster and showing less differentiation between warned and non-warned locations. Statistical modeling demonstrates socioeconomic variations in both evacuation decision rates and recovery patterns. These findings inform emergency communication strategies for climate-driven disasters, highlighting the need for targeted alerts, socioeconomically calibrated messaging, and staged evacuation procedures to enhance public safety during crises."
2503.21912,"Interdisciplinary research has gained prominence as a necessity for addressing complex challenges, yet its impact on early academic careers remains unclear. This study examines how interdisciplinarity during doctoral training influences faculty placement at top universities across diverse fields. Analyzing the career trajectories of over 30,000 tenure-track faculty members who earned their Ph.D. degrees after 2005 and their initial faculty placement at 355 U.S. universities, we find that faculty newly hired by top-ranked universities tend to be less interdisciplinary in their Ph.D. research, particularly when they obtained Ph.D. from top universities and remain in their Ph.D. research field. This may reflect community trends towards homogeneity: at top universities, the existing faculty research is less interdisciplinary and more aligned with the candidates that they hire (who also exhibit lower interdisciplinarity). This preference disadvantages the placement of women graduates, who exhibit higher interdisciplinarity on average. Furthermore, we show that newly hired faculty with greater interdisciplinarity, when placed at top universities, tend to achieve higher long-term research productivity. This suggests a potential loss in knowledge production if top universities continue to undervalue interdisciplinary candidates. These findings highlight structural barriers in faculty hiring and raise concerns about the long-term consequences of prioritizing disciplinary specialization over interdisciplinary expertise."
2503.22023,"As global discourse on AI regulation gains momentum, this paper focuses on delineating the impact of ML on autonomy and fostering awareness. Respect for autonomy is a basic principle in bioethics that establishes persons as decision-makers. While the concept of autonomy in the context of ML appears in several European normative publications, it remains a theoretical concept that has yet to be widely accepted in ML practice. Our contribution is to bridge the theoretical and practical gap by encouraging the practical application of autonomy in decision-making within ML practice by identifying the conditioning factors that currently prevent it. Consequently, we focus on the different stages of the ML pipeline to identify the potential effects on ML end-users' autonomy. To improve its practical utility, we propose a related question for each detected impact, offering guidance for identifying possible focus points to respect ML end-users autonomy in decision-making."
2503.22035,"AI is transforming industries, raising concerns about job displacement and decision making reliability. AI, as a universal approximation function, excels in data driven tasks but struggles with small datasets, subjective probabilities, and contexts requiring human judgment, relationships, andthis http URLEPOCH framework highlights five irreplaceable human capabilities: Empathy, Presence, Opinion, Creativity, and Hope. These attributes are vital in financial services for trust, inclusion, innovation, and consumer experience. Although AI improves efficiency in risk management and compliance, it will not eliminate jobs but redefine them, similar to how ATMs reshaped bank tellers' roles. The challenge is ensuring professionals adapt, leveraging AI's strengths while preserving essential human capabilities."
2503.22116,"As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly embedded in critical societal functions, the need for robust red teaming methodologies continues to grow. In this forum piece, we examine emerging approaches to automating AI red teaming, with a particular focus on how the application of automated methods affects human-driven efforts. We discuss the role of labor in automated red teaming processes, the benefits and limitations of automation, and its broader implications for AI safety and labor practices. Drawing on existing frameworks and case studies, we argue for a balanced approach that combines human expertise with automated tools to strengthen AI risk assessment. Finally, we highlight key challenges in scaling automated red teaming, including considerations around worker proficiency, agency, and context-awareness."
2503.22151,"AI risks are typically framed around physical threats to humanity, a loss of control or an accidental error causing humanity's extinction. However, I argue in line with the gradual disempowerment thesis, that there is an underappreciated risk in the slow and irrevocable decline of human autonomy. As AI starts to outcompete humans in various areas of life, a tipping point will be reached where it no longer makes sense to rely on human decision-making, creativity, social care or even leadership.What may follow is a process of gradual de-skilling, where we lose skills that we currently take for granted. Traditionally, it is argued that AI will gain human skills over time, and that these skills are innate and immutable in humans. By contrast, I argue that humans may lose such skills as critical thinking, decision-making and even social care in an AGI world. The biggest threat to humanity is therefore not that machines will become more like humans, but that humans will become more like machines."
2503.22181,"This paper proposes the e-person architecture for constructing a unified and incremental development of AI ethics. The e-person architecture takes the reduction of uncertainty through collaborative cognition and action with others as a unified basis for ethics. By classifying and defining uncertainty along two axes - (1) first, second, and third person perspectives, and (2) the difficulty of inference based on the depth of information - we support the development of unified and incremental development of AI ethics. In addition, we propose the e-person framework based on the free energy principle, which considers the reduction of uncertainty as a unifying principle of brain function, with the aim of implementing the e-person architecture, and we show our previous works and future challenges based on the proposed framework."
2503.22315,"Current political developments worldwide illustrate that research on democratic backsliding is as important as ever. A recent exchange in Political Science & Politics (2/2024) has highlighted again a fundamental challenge in this literature: the measurement of democracy. With many democracy indicators consisting of subjective assessments rather than factual observations, trends in democracy over time could be due to human biases in the coding of these indicators rather than empirical facts. In this paper, we leverage two cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) for the coding of democracy indicators from the V-Dem project. With access to a huge amount of information, these models may be able to rate the many ""soft"" characteristics of regimes without the cognitive biases that humans potentially possess. While LLM-generated codings largely align with expert coders for many countries, we show that when these models deviate from human assessments, they do so in different but consistent ways: Some LLMs are too pessimistic, while others consistently overestimate the democratic quality of these countries. While the combination of the two LLM codings can alleviate this concern, we conclude that it is difficult to replace human coders with LLMs, since the extent and direction of these attitudes is not known a priori."
2503.22735,"This article reports on the third iteration of a survey of computerized tools and technologies taught as part of postgraduate translation training programmes. While the survey was carried out under the aegis of the EMT Network, more than half of responses are from outside that network. The results show the responsiveness of programmes to innovations in translation technology, with increased compulsory inclusion of machine translation, post-editing, and quality evaluation, and a rapid response to the release of generative tools. The flexibility required during the Covid-19 pandemic has also led to some lasting changes to programmes. While the range of tools being taught has continued to expand, programmes seem to be consolidating their core offering around cloud-based software with cost-free academic access. There has also been an increase in the embedding of professional contexts and workflows associated with translation technology. Generic file management and data security skills have increased in perceived importance, and legal and ethical issues related to translation data have also become more prominent. In terms of course delivery the shift away from conventional labs identified in EMT2017 has accelerated markedly, no doubt partly driven by the pandemic, accompanied by a dramatic expansion in the use of students' personal devices."
2503.22741,"Due to their versatility, concept maps are used in various educational settings and serve as tools that enable educators to comprehend students' knowledge construction. An essential component for analyzing a concept map is its structure, which can be categorized into three distinct types: spoke, network, and chain. Understanding the predominant structure in a map offers insights into the student's depth of comprehension of the subject. Therefore, this study examined 317 distinct concept map structures, classifying them into one of the three types, and used statistical and descriptive information from the maps to train multiclass classification models. As a result, we achieved an 86\% accuracy in classification using a Decision Tree. This promising outcome can be employed in concept map assessment systems to provide real-time feedback to the student."
2503.22756,"The rapid digitalisation of contemporary society has profoundly impacted various facets of our lives, including healthcare, communication, business, and education. The ability to engage with new technologies and solve problems has become crucial, making CT skills, such as pattern recognition, decomposition, and algorithm design, essential competencies. In response, Switzerland is conducting research and initiatives to integrate CT into its educational system. This study aims to develop a comprehensive framework for large-scale assessment of CT skills, particularly focusing on AT, the ability to design algorithms. To achieve this, we first developed a competence model capturing the situated and developmental nature of CT, guiding the design of activities tailored to cognitive abilities, age, and context. This framework clarifies how activity characteristics influence CT development and how to assess these competencies. Additionally, we developed an activity for large-scale assessment of AT skills, offered in two variants: one based on non-digital artefacts (unplugged) and manual expert assessment, and the other based on digital artefacts (virtual) and automatic assessment. To provide a more comprehensive evaluation of students' competencies, we developed an IAS based on BNs with noisy gates, which offers real-time probabilistic assessment for each skill rather than a single overall score. The results indicate that the proposed instrument can measure AT competencies across different age groups and educational contexts in Switzerland, demonstrating its applicability for large-scale use. AT competencies exhibit a progressive development, with no overall gender differences, though variations are observed at the school level, significantly influenced by the artefact-based environment and its context, underscoring the importance of creating accessible and adaptable assessment tools."
2503.22763,"Can randomness be better than scheduled practices, for securing an event at a large venue such as a stadium or entertainment arena? Perhaps surprisingly, from several perspectives the answer is ""yes."" This note examines findings from an extensive study of the problem, including interviews and a survey of selected venue security directors. That research indicates that: randomness has several goals; many security directors recognize its potential; but very few have used it much, if at all. Some fear they will not be able to defend using random methods if an adversary does slip through security. Others are concerned that staff may not be able to perform effectively. We discuss ways in which it appears that randomness can improve effectiveness, ways it can be effectively justified to those who must approve security processes, and some potential research or regulatory advances."
2503.22769,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been advancing rapidly and with the advent of large language models (LLMs) in late 2022, numerous opportunities have emerged for adopting this technology across various domains, including medicine. These innovations hold immense potential to revolutionize and modernize medical education. Our research project leverages large language models to enhance medical education and address workflow challenges through the development of MediTools - AI Medical Education. This prototype application focuses on developing interactive tools that simulate real-life clinical scenarios, provide access to medical literature, and keep users updated with the latest medical news. Our first tool is a dermatology case simulation tool that uses real patient images depicting various dermatological conditions and enables interaction with LLMs acting as virtual patients. This platform allows users to practice their diagnostic skills and enhance their clinical decision-making abilities. The application also features two additional tools: an AI-enhanced PubMed tool for engaging with LLMs to gain deeper insights into research papers, and a Google News tool that offers LLM generated summaries of articles for various medical specialties. A comprehensive survey has been conducted among medical professionals and students to gather initial feedback on the effectiveness and user satisfaction of MediTools, providing insights for further development and refinement of the application. This research demonstrates the potential of AI-driven tools in transforming and revolutionizing medical education, offering a scalable and interactive platform for continuous learning and skill development."
2503.22772,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly permeate caregiving, educational, and emotionally sensitive domains, there is a growing need to assess national readiness beyond infrastructure and innovation capacity. Existing indices such as the Stanford AI Index (2024), overlooked relational, ethical, and cultural dimensions essential to human centered AI integration. To address this blind spot, this study introduces the AI Family Integration Index (AFII), a ten dimensional benchmarking framework that evaluates national preparedness for integrating emotionally intelligent AI into family and caregiving systems. Using mixed-method analysis and equal weighting, the AFII provides a multidimensional tool for assessing emotional and symbolic readiness in diverse cultural contexts. A core insight is the policy practice gap: while many governments articulate ethical AI principles, few have implemented them effectively in relational or caregiving domains. Countries like Singapore, Japan, and South Korea demonstrate alignment between policy intent and caregiving integration, while others such as the United States and France, exhibit advanced policy rhetoric but slower real-world execution. This dissonance is captured through the AFII Governance Gap Lens. The AFII also reveals divergence from conventional rankings: technological leaders like the U.S. and China score high in the Stanford AI Index yet rank lower in AFII due to weaker caregiving alignment. In contrast, nations like Sweden and Singapore outperform on relational readiness despite moderate technical rankings. For policymakers, the AFII offers a practical, scalable, and ethically grounded tool to guide inclusive AI strategies, reframing readiness to center care, emotional safety, and cultural legitimacy in the age of relational AI."
2503.23056,"Unfair treatment and discrimination are critical ethical concerns in AI systems, particularly as their adoption expands across diverse domains. Addressing these challenges, the recent introduction of the EU AI Act establishes a unified legal framework to ensure legal certainty for AI innovation and investment while safeguarding public interests, such as health, safety, fundamental rights, democracy, and the rule of law (Recital 8). The Act encourages stakeholders to initiate dialogue on existing AI fairness notions to address discriminatory outcomes of AI systems. However, these notions often overlook the critical role of Socio-Economic Status (SES), inadvertently perpetuating biases that favour the economically advantaged. This is concerning, given that principles of equalization advocate for equalizing resources or opportunities to mitigate disadvantages beyond an individual's control. While provisions for discrimination are laid down in the AI Act, specialized directions should be broadened, particularly in addressing economic disparities perpetuated by AI systems. In this work, we explore the limitations of popular AI fairness notions using a real-world dataset (Adult), highlighting their inability to address SES-driven disparities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel fairness notion, Socio-Economic Parity (SEP), which incorporates SES and promotes positive actions for underprivileged groups while accounting for factors within an individual's control, such as working hours, which can serve as a proxy for effort. We define a corresponding fairness measure and optimize a model constrained by SEP to demonstrate practical utility. Our results show the effectiveness of SEP in mitigating SES-driven biases. By analyzing the AI Act alongside our method, we lay a foundation for aligning AI fairness with SES factors while ensuring legal compliance."
2503.23118,"We tackle the challenge brought to urban library systems by the {holds system} -- which allows users to request books available at other branches to be transferred for local pickup. The holds system increases usage of the entire collection, at the expense of an in-person browser's experience at the source branch. We study the optimization of usage and browser experience, where the library has two levers: where a book should come from when a hold request is placed, and how many book copies at each branch should be available through the holds system versus reserved for browsers. We first show that the problem of maximizing usage can be viewed through the lens of revenue management, for which near-optimal fulfillment policies exist. We then develop a simulation framework that further optimizes for browser experience, through book reservations. We empirically apply our methods to data from the New York Public Library to design implementable policies. We find that though a substantial trade-off exists between these two desiderata, a balanced policy can improve browser experience over the historical policy without significantly sacrificing usage. Because browser usage is more prevalent among branches in low-income areas, this policy further increases system-wide equity: notably, for branches in the 25% lowest-income neighborhoods, it improves both usage and browser experience by about 15%."
2503.23444,"Since SARS-CoV-2 started spreading in Europe in early 2020, there has been a strong call for technical solutions to combat or contain the pandemic, with contact tracing apps at the heart of the debates. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires controllers to carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) where their data processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms (Art. 35 GDPR). A DPIA is a structured risk analysis that identifies and evaluates possible consequences of data processing relevant to fundamental rights in advance and describes the measures envisaged to address these risks or expresses the inability to do so. Based on the Standard Data Protection Model (SDM), we present the results of a scientific and methodologically clear DPIA of the German German Corona-Warn-App (CWA). It shows that even a decentralized architecture involves numerous serious weaknesses and risks, including larger ones still left unaddressed in current implementations. It also found that none of the proposed designs operates on anonymous data or ensures proper anonymisation. It also showed that informed consent would not be a legitimate legal ground for the processing. For all points where data subjects' rights are still not sufficiently safeguarded, we briefly outline solutions."
2503.23622,"The growing use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT has raised urgent concerns about their impact on student learning, particularly the potential erosion of critical thinking and creativity. As students increasingly turn to these tools to complete assessments, foundational cognitive skills are at risk of being bypassed, challenging the integrity of higher education and the authenticity of student work. Existing AI-generated text detection tools are inadequate; they produce unreliable outputs and are prone to both false positives and false negatives, especially when students apply paraphrasing, translation, or rewording. These systems rely on shallow statistical patterns rather than true contextual or semantic understanding, making them unsuitable as definitive indicators of AI misuse. In response, this research proposes a proactive, AI-resilient solution based on assessment design rather than detection. It introduces a web-based Python tool that integrates Bloom's Taxonomy with advanced natural language processing techniques including GPT-3.5 Turbo, BERT-based semantic similarity, and TF-IDF metrics to evaluate the AI-solvability of assessment tasks. By analyzing surface-level and semantic features, the tool helps educators determine whether a task targets lower-order thinking such as recall and summarization or higher-order skills such as analysis, evaluation, and creation, which are more resistant to AI automation. This framework empowers educators to design cognitively demanding, AI-resistant assessments that promote originality, critical thinking, and fairness. It offers a sustainable, pedagogically sound strategy to foster authentic learning and uphold academic standards in the age of AI."
2503.24095,"Images of war are almost as old as war itself. From cave paintings to photographs of mobile devices on social media, humans always had the urge to capture particularly important events during a war. Images provide visual evidence. For armed forces, they may serve as the output of a sensor (e.g. in aerial reconnaissance) or as an effector on cognition (e.g. in form of photographic propaganda). They can inform, influence, or even manipulate a target audience. The recent advancements in the field of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to synthesize photorealistic images give rise to several new challenges for armed forces. The objective of this report is to investigate the role of AI-generated images for armed forces and provide an overview on opportunities and threats. When compared with traditional image generation (e.g. photography), generative AI brings distinct conceptual advantages to implement new tactical tenets and concepts which so far have not been feasible: masses of AI-generated images can be used for deceptive purposes, to influence the pace of combat in the information environment, to cause surprise, sow confusion and shock. AI-generated images are a tool favoured for offensive manoeuvres in the information environment. To prepare for future challenges involving AI-generated images and improve their resilience, recommendations are given at the end of the report for all branches of the armed forces, who are active in cyber defense and/or exposed to the information environment."
2504.00091,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is enabling unprecedented automation in content creation and decision support, but it also raises novel risks. This paper presents a first-principles risk assessment framework underlying the IEEE P3396 Recommended Practice for AI Risk, Safety, Trustworthiness, and Responsibility. We distinguish between process risks (risks arising from how AI systems are built or operated) and outcome risks (risks manifest in the AI system's outputs and their real-world effects), arguing that generative AI governance should prioritize outcome risks. Central to our approach is an information-centric ontology that classifies AI-generated outputs into four fundamental categories: (1) Perception-level information, (2) Knowledge-level information, (3) Decision/Action plan information, and (4) Control tokens (access or resource directives). This classification allows systematic identification of harms and more precise attribution of responsibility to stakeholders (developers, deployers, users, regulators) based on the nature of the information produced. We illustrate how each information type entails distinct outcome risks (e.g. deception, misinformation, unsafe recommendations, security breaches) and requires tailored risk metrics and mitigations. By grounding the framework in the essence of information, human agency, and cognition, we align risk evaluation with how AI outputs influence human understanding and action. The result is a principled approach to AI risk that supports clear accountability and targeted safeguards, in contrast to broad application-based risk categorizations. We include example tables mapping information types to risks and responsibilities. This work aims to inform the IEEE P3396 Recommended Practice and broader AI governance with a rigorous, first-principles foundation for assessing generative AI risks while enabling responsible innovation."
2504.00388,"There are not one but two dimensions of bias that can be revealed through the study of large AI models: not only bias in training data or the products of an AI, but also bias in society, such as disparity in employment or health outcomes between different demographic groups. Often training data and AI output is biased for or against certain demographics (i.e. older white people are overrepresented in image datasets), but sometimes large AI models accurately illustrate biases in the real world (i.e. young black men being disproportionately viewed as threatening). These social disparities often appear in image generation AI outputs in the form of 'marked' features, where some feature of an individual or setting is a social marker of disparity, and prompts both humans and AI systems to treat subjects that are marked in this way as exceptional and requiring special treatment. Generative AI has proven to be very sensitive to such marked features, to the extent of over-emphasising them and thus often exacerbating social biases. I briefly discuss how we can use complex prompts to image generation AI to investigate either dimension of bias, emphasising how we can probe the large language models underlying image generation AI through, for example, automated sentiment analysis of the text prompts used to generate images."
2504.00408,"Generative AI has the potential to transform personalization and accessibility of education. However, it raises serious concerns about accuracy and helping students become independent critical thinkers. In this study, we designed a helpful AI ""Peer"" to help students correct fundamental physics misconceptions related to Newtonian mechanic concepts. In contrast to approaches that seek near-perfect accuracy to create an authoritative AI tutor or teacher, we directly inform students that this AI can answer up to 40% of questions incorrectly. In a randomized controlled trial with 165 students, those who engaged in targeted dialogue with the AI Peer achieved post-test scores that were, on average, 10.5 percentage points higher - with over 20 percentage points higher normalized gain - than a control group that discussed physics history. Qualitative feedback indicated that 91% of the treatment group's AI interactions were rated as helpful. Furthermore, by comparing student performance on pre- and post-test questions about the same concept, along with experts' annotations of the AI interactions, we find initial evidence suggesting the improvement in performance does not depend on the correctness of the AI. With further research, the AI Peer paradigm described here could open new possibilities for how we learn, adapt to, and grow with AI."
2504.00533,"Competitive programming (CP) has been increasingly integrated into computer science curricula worldwide due to its efficacy in enhancing students' algorithmic reasoning and problem-solving skills. However, existing CP curriculum designs predominantly employ a problem-based approach, lacking the critical dimension of time pressure of real competitive programming contests. Such constraints are prevalent not only in programming contests but also in various real-world scenarios, including technical interviews, software development sprints, and hackathons.To bridge this gap, we introduce a contest-based approach to curriculum design that explicitly incorporates realistic contest scenarios into formative assessments, simulating authentic competitive programming experiences. This paper details the design and implementation of such a course at Purdue University, structured to systematically develop students' observational skills, algorithmic techniques, and efficient coding and debugging practices. We outline a pedagogical framework comprising cooperative learning strategies, contest-based assessments, and supplemental activities to boost students' problem-solving capabilities."
2504.00652,"Artificial intelligence (AI) trends vary significantly across global regions, shaping the trajectory of innovation, regulation, and societal impact. This variation influences how different regions approach AI development, balancing technological progress with ethical and regulatory considerations. This study conducts a comparative analysis of AI trends in the United States (US), the European Union (EU), and Asia, focusing on three key dimensions: generative AI, ethical oversight, and industrial applications. The US prioritizes market-driven innovation with minimal regulatory constraints, the EU enforces a precautionary risk-based framework emphasizing ethical safeguards, and Asia employs state-guided AI strategies that balance rapid deployment with regulatory oversight. Although these approaches reflect different economic models and policy priorities, their divergence poses challenges to international collaboration, regulatory harmonization, and the development of global AI standards. To address these challenges, this paper synthesizes regional strengths to propose an adaptive AI governance framework that integrates risk-tiered oversight, innovation accelerators, and strategic alignment mechanisms. By bridging governance gaps, this study offers actionable insights for fostering responsible AI development while ensuring a balance between technological progress, ethical imperatives, and regulatory coherence."
2504.00797,"As the possibilities for Artificial Intelligence (AI) have grown, so have concerns regarding its impacts on society and the environment. However, these issues are often raised separately; i.e. carbon footprint analyses of AI models typically do not consider how the pursuit of scale has contributed towards building models that are both inaccessible to most researchers in terms of cost and disproportionately harmful to the environment. On the other hand, model audits that aim to evaluate model performance and disparate impacts mostly fail to engage with the environmental ramifications of AI models and how these fit into their auditing approaches. In this separation, both research directions fail to capture the depth of analysis that can be explored by considering the two in parallel and the potential solutions for making informed choices that can be developed at their convergence. In this essay, we build upon work carried out in AI and in sister communities, such as philosophy and sustainable development, to make more deliberate connections around topics such as generalizability, transparency, evaluation and equity across AI research and practice. We argue that the efforts aiming to study AI's ethical ramifications should be made in tandem with those evaluating its impacts on the environment, and we conclude with a proposal of best practices to better integrate AI ethics and sustainability in AI research and practice."
2504.00899,"The role and use of race within health-related artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models has sparked increasing attention and controversy. Despite the complexity and breadth of related issues, a robust and holistic framework to guide stakeholders in their examination and resolution remains lacking. This perspective provides a broad-based, systematic, and cross-cutting landscape analysis of race-related challenges, structured around the AI/ML lifecycle and framed through ""points to consider"" to support inquiry and decision-making."
2504.00955,"This paper challenges the argument that generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is entitled to broad immunity from copyright law for reproducing copyrighted works without authorization due to a fair use defense. It examines fair use legal arguments and eight distinct substantive arguments, contending that every legal and substantive argument favoring fair use for GenAI applies equally, if not more so, to humans. Therefore, granting GenAI exceptional privileges in this domain is legally and logically inconsistent with withholding broad fair use exemptions from individual humans. It would mean no human would need to pay for virtually any copyright work again. The solution is to take a circumspect view of any fair use claim for mass copyright reproduction by any entity and focus on the first principles of whether permitting such exceptionalism for GenAI promotes science and the arts."
2504.00961,"Gathering enough data to create sufficiently useful training datasets for generative artificial intelligence requires scraping most public websites. The scraping is conducted using pieces of code (scraping bots) that make copies of website pages. Today, there are only a few ways for website owners to effectively block these bots from scraping content. One method, prohibiting scraping in the website terms of service, is loosely enforced because it is not always clear when the terms are enforceable. This paper aims to clear up the confusion by describing what scraping is, how entities do it, what makes website terms of service enforceable, and what claims of damages website owners may make as a result of being scraped. The novel argument of the paper is that when (i) a site's terms of service or terms of use prohibit scraping or using site content to train AI and (ii) a bot scrapes pages on the website including those terms, the bot's deployer has actual notice of the terms and those terms are therefore legally enforceable, meaning the site can claim a breach of contract. This paper also details the legal and substantive arguments favoring this position while cautioning that nonprofits with a primarily scientific research focus should be exempt from such strict enforcement."
2504.01029,"The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has raised major privacy and ethical concerns. However, existing AI incident taxonomies and guidelines lack grounding in real-world cases, limiting their effectiveness for prevention and mitigation. We analyzed 202 real-world AI privacy and ethical incidents to develop a taxonomy that classifies them across AI lifecycle stages and captures contributing factors, including causes, responsible entities, sources of disclosure, and impacts. Our findings reveal widespread harms from poor organizational decisions and legal non-compliance, limited corrective interventions, and rare reporting from AI developers and adopting entities. Our taxonomy offers a structured approach for systematic incident reporting and emphasizes the weaknesses of current AI governance frameworks. Our findings provide actionable guidance for policymakers and practitioners to strengthen user protections, develop targeted AI policies, enhance reporting practices, and foster responsible AI governance and innovation, especially in contexts such as social media and child protection."
2504.01032,"Since the introduction of ChatGPT in 2022, Large language models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMM) have transformed content creation, enabling the generation of human-quality content, spanning every medium, text, images, videos, and audio. The chances offered by generative AI models are endless and are drastically reducing the time required to generate content and usually raising the quality of the generation. However, considering the complexity and the difficult traceability of the generated content, the use of these tools provides challenges in attributing AI-generated content. The difficult attribution resides for a variety of reasons, starting from the lack of a systematic fingerprinting of the generated content and ending with the enormous amount of data on which LLMs and LMM are trained, which makes it difficult to connect generated content to the training data. This scenario is raising concerns about intellectual property and ethical responsibilities. To address these concerns, in this paper, we bridge the technological, ethical, and legislative aspects, by proposing a review of the legislative and technological instruments today available and proposing a legal framework to ensure accountability. In the end, we propose three use cases of how these can be combined to guarantee that attribution is respected. However, even though the techniques available today can guarantee a greater attribution to a greater extent, strong limitations still apply, that can be solved uniquely by the development of new attribution techniques, to be applied to LLMs and LMMs."
2504.01034,"Do robots vote? Do machines make decisions instead of us? No, (at least not yet), but this is something that could happen. The impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on democracy is a complex issue that requires thorough research and careful regulation. At the most important level, that of the electoral process, it is noted that it is not determined by the AI, but it is greatly impacted by its multiple applications. New types of online campaigns, driven by AI applications, are replacing traditional ones. The potential for manipulating voters and indirectly influencing the electoral outcome should not be underestimated. Certainly, instances of voter manipulation are not absent from traditional political campaigns, with the only difference being that digital manipulation is often carried out without our knowledge, e.g. by monitoring our behavior on social media. Nevertheless, we should not overlook the positive impact that AI has in the upgrading of democratic institutions by providing a forum for participation in decision-making. In this context, as a first step, we look into the potential jeopardization of democratic processes posed by the use of AI tools. Secondly, we consider the possibility of strengthening democratic processes by using AI, as well as the democratization of AI itself through the possibilities it offers. And thirdly, the impact of AI on the representative system is also discussed. The paper is concluded with recommendations and conclusions."
2504.01036,"Due to increased computing use, data centers consume and emit a lot of energy and carbon. These contributions are expected to rise as big data analytics, digitization, and large AI models grow and become major components of daily working routines. To reduce the environmental impact of software development, green (sustainable) coding and claims that AI models can improve energy efficiency have grown in popularity. Furthermore, in the automotive industry, where software increasingly governs vehicle performance, safety, and user experience, the principles of green coding and AI-driven efficiency could significantly contribute to reducing the sector's environmental footprint. We present an overview of green coding and metrics to measure AI model sustainability awareness. This study introduces LLM as a service and uses a generative commercial AI language model, GitHub Copilot, to auto-generate code. Using sustainability metrics to quantify these AI models' sustainability awareness, we define the code's embodied and operational carbon."
2504.01037,"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into social science research presents transformative opportunities for advancing scientific inquiry, particularly in public administration (PA). However, the absence of standardized methodologies for using LLMs poses significant challenges for ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. This manuscript introduces the TaMPER framework-a structured methodology organized around five critical decision points: Task, Model, Prompt, Evaluation, and Reporting. The TaMPER framework provides scholars with a systematic approach to leveraging LLMs effectively while addressing key challenges such as model variability, prompt design, evaluation protocols, and transparent reporting practices."
2504.01039,"This short paper puts forward a vision for a new democratic model enabled by the recent technological advances in agentic AI. It therefore opens with drawing a clear and concise picture of the model, and only later addresses related proposals and research directions, and concerns regarding feasibility and safety. It ends with a note on the timeliness of this idea and on optimism. The model proposed is that of assigning each citizen an AI Agent that would serve as their political delegate, enabling the return to direct democracy. The paper examines this models relation to existing research, its potential setbacks and feasibility and argues for its further development."
2504.01043,"It is commonly accepted that clinicians are ethically obligated to disclose their use of medical machine learning systems to patients, and that failure to do so would amount to a moral fault for which clinicians ought to be held accountable. Call this ""the disclosure thesis."" Four main arguments have been, or could be, given to support the disclosure thesis in the ethics literature: the risk-based argument, the rights-based argument, the materiality argument, and the autonomy argument. In this article, I argue that each of these four arguments are unconvincing, and therefore, that the disclosure thesis ought to be rejected. I suggest that mandating disclosure may also even risk harming patients by providing stakeholders with a way to avoid accountability for harm that results from improper applications or uses of these systems."
2504.01045,"This research project explores the optimization of the family selection process for participation in Uruguay's Crece Contigo Family Support Program (PAF) through machine learning. An anonymized database of 15,436 previous referral cases was analyzed, focusing on pregnant women and children under four years of age. The main objective was to develop a predictive algorithm capable of determining whether a family meets the conditions for acceptance into the program. The implementation of this model seeks to streamline the evaluation process and allow for more efficient resource allocation, allocating more team time to direct support. The study included an exhaustive data analysis and the implementation of various machine learning models, including Neural Networks (NN), XGBoost (XGB), LSTM, and ensemble models. Techniques to address class imbalance, such as SMOTE and RUS, were applied, as well as decision threshold optimization to improve prediction accuracy and balance. The results demonstrate the potential of these techniques for efficient classification of families requiring assistance."
2504.01054,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been subject to extensive research in the past few years. This is particularly true for the potential of LLMs to generate formative programming feedback for novice learners at university. In contrast to Generative AI (GenAI) tools based on LLMs, such as GPT, smaller and open models have received much less attention. Yet, they offer several benefits, as educators can let them run on a virtual machine or personal computer. This can help circumvent some major concerns applicable to other GenAI tools and LLMs (e. g., data protection, lack of control over changes, privacy). Therefore, this study explores the feedback characteristics of the open, lightweight LLM Llama 3.2 (3B). In particular, we investigate the models' responses to authentic student solutions to introductory programming exercises written in Java. The generated output is qualitatively analyzed to help evaluate the feedback's quality, content, structure, and other features. The results provide a comprehensive overview of the feedback capabilities and serious shortcomings of this open, small LLM. We further discuss the findings in the context of previous research on LLMs and contribute to benchmarking recently available GenAI tools and their feedback for novice learners of programming. Thereby, this work has implications for educators, learners, and tool developers attempting to utilize all variants of LLMs (including open, and small models) to generate formative feedback and support learning."
2504.01167,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented emergent capabilities, including content generation, translation, and simulation of human behavior. Field experiments, on the other hand, are widely employed in social studies to examine real-world human behavior through carefully designed manipulations and treatments. However, field experiments are known to be expensive and time consuming. Therefore, an interesting question is whether and how LLMs can be utilized for field experiments. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an automated LLM-based framework to predict the outcomes of a field experiment. Applying this framework to 276 experiments about a wide range of human behaviors drawn from renowned economics literature yields a prediction accuracy of 78%. Moreover, we find that the distributions of the results are either bimodal or highly skewed. By investigating this abnormality further, we identify that field experiments related to complex social issues such as ethnicity, social norms, and ethical dilemmas can pose significant challenges to the prediction performance."
2504.01352,"The field of human computation and crowdsourcing has historically studied how tasks can be outsourced to humans. However, many tasks previously distributed to human crowds can today be completed by generative AI with human-level abilities, and concerns about crowdworkers increasingly using language models to complete tasks are surfacing. These developments undermine core premises of the field. In this paper, we examine the evolution of the Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP) - a representative example of the field as one of its key venues - through the lens of Kuhn's paradigm shifts. We review 12 years of research at HCOMP, mapping the evolution of HCOMP's research topics and identifying significant shifts over time. Reflecting on the findings through the lens of Kuhn's paradigm shifts, we suggest that these shifts do not constitute a paradigm shift. Ultimately, our analysis of gradual topic shifts over time, combined with data on the evident overlap with related venues, contributes a data-driven perspective to the broader discussion about the future of HCOMP and the field as a whole."
2504.01522,"In this paper, we offer an overview of indigenous languages, identifying the causes of their devaluation and the need for legislation on language rights. We review the technologies used to revitalize these languages, finding that when they come from outside, they often have the opposite effect to what they seek; however, when developed from within communities, they become powerful instruments of expression. We propose that the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge in large language models (LLMs) will enrich the technological landscape, but must be done in a participatory environment that encourages the exchange of knowledge."
2504.01992,"This paper explores artificial intelligence's potential societal and economic impacts (AI) through generating scenarios that assess how AI may influence various sectors. We categorize and analyze key factors affecting AI's integration and adoption by applying an Impact-Uncertainty Matrix. A proposed methodology involves querying academic databases, identifying emerging trends and topics, and categorizing these into an impact uncertainty framework. The paper identifies critical areas where AI may bring significant change and outlines potential future scenarios based on these insights. This research aims to inform policymakers, industry leaders, and researchers on the strategic planning required to address the challenges and opportunities AI presents"
2504.02,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly central to economic growth, promising new efficiencies and markets. This economic significance has sparked debate over AI regulation: do rules and oversight bolster long term growth by building trust and safeguarding the public, or do they constrain innovation and free enterprise? This paper examines the balance between AI regulation and capitalist ideals, focusing on how different approaches to AI data privacy can impact innovation in AI-driven applications. The central question is whether AI regulation enhances or inhibits growth in a capitalist economy. Our analysis synthesizes historical precedents, the current U.S. regulatory landscape, economic projections, legal challenges, and case studies of recent AI policies. We discuss that carefully calibrated AI data privacy regulations-balancing innovation incentives with the public interest can foster sustainable growth by building trust and ensuring responsible data use, while excessive regulation may risk stifling innovation and entrenching incumbents."
2504.02009,"Urban computing has emerged as a multidisciplinary field that harnesses data-driven technologies to address challenges and improve urban living. Traditional approaches, while beneficial, often face challenges with generalization, scalability, and contextual understanding. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential in this domain. This survey explores the intersection of LLMs and urban computing, emphasizing the impact of LLMs in processing and analyzing urban data, enhancing decision-making, and fostering citizen engagement. We provide a concise overview of the evolution and core technologies of LLMs. Additionally, we survey their applications across key urban domains, such as transportation, public safety, and environmental monitoring, summarizing essential tasks and prior works in various urban contexts, while highlighting LLMs' functional roles and implementation patterns. Building on this, we propose potential LLM-based solutions to address unresolved challenges. To facilitate in-depth research, we compile a list of available datasets and tools applicable to diverse urban scenarios. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current approaches and outline future directions for advancing LLMs in urban computing."
2504.02127,"The governance of frontier artificial intelligence (AI) systems--particularly those capable of catastrophic misuse or systemic failure--requires institutional structures that are robust, adaptive, and innovation-preserving. This paper proposes a novel framework for governing such high-stakes models through a three-tiered insurance architecture: (1) mandatory private liability insurance for frontier model developers; (2) an industry-administered risk pool to absorb recurring, non-catastrophic losses; and (3) federally backed reinsurance for tail-risk events. Drawing from historical precedents in nuclear energy (Price-Anderson), terrorism risk (TRIA), agricultural crop insurance, flood reinsurance, and medical malpractice, the proposal shows how the federal government can stabilize private AI insurance markets without resorting to brittle regulation or predictive licensing regimes. The structure aligns incentives between AI developers and downstream stakeholders, transforms safety practices into insurable standards, and enables modular oversight through adaptive eligibility criteria. By focusing on risk-transfer mechanisms rather than prescriptive rules, this framework seeks to render AI safety a structural feature of the innovation ecosystem itself--integrated into capital markets, not external to them. The paper concludes with a legal and administrative feasibility analysis, proposing avenues for statutory authorization and agency placement within existing federal structures."
2504.02239,"In the age of AI, authorship is being quietly eroded by algorithmic content scraping, legal gray zones like ""fair use,"" and platforms that profit from creative labor without consent or compensation. This short manifesto proposes a radical alternative: a system in which the author is sovereign of their intellectual domain. It presents seven ethical principles that challenge prevailing assumptions about open access, copyright ownership, and the public domain - arguing that voluntary, negotiated consent must replace coercive norms. The text exposes how weakened authorship fuels structural exploitation. In place of reactive solutions, it calls for a new ethic of authorship rooted in consent, dignity, and contractual fairness."
2504.02461,"Current fairness metrics and mitigation techniques provide tools for practitioners to asses how non-discriminatory Automatic Decision Making (ADM) systems are. What if I, as an individual facing a decision taken by an ADM system, would like to know: Am I being treated fairly? We explore how to create the affordance for users to be able to ask this question of ADM. In this paper, we argue for the reification of fairness not only as a property of ADM, but also as an epistemic right of an individual to acquire information about the decisions that affect them and use that information to contest and seek effective redress against those decisions, in case they are proven to be discriminatory. We examine key concepts from existing research not only in algorithmic fairness but also in explainable artificial intelligence, accountability, and contestability. Integrating notions from these domains, we propose a conceptual framework to ascertain fairness by combining different tools that empower the end-users of ADM systems. Our framework shifts the focus from technical solutions aimed at practitioners to mechanisms that enable individuals to understand, challenge, and verify the fairness of decisions, and also serves as a blueprint for organizations and policymakers, bridging the gap between technical requirements and practical, user-centered accountability."
2504.02504,"This chapter explores three key questions in blockchain ethics. First, it situates blockchain ethics within the broader field of technology ethics, outlining its goals and guiding principles. Second, it examines the unique ethical challenges of blockchain applications, including permissionless systems, incentive mechanisms, and privacy concerns. Key obstacles, such as conceptual modeling and information asymmetries, are identified as critical issues. Finally, the chapter argues that blockchain ethics should be approached as an engineering discipline, emphasizing the analysis and design of trade-offs in complex systems."
2504.02636,"As generative artificial intelligence (GAI) becomes more integrated into higher education and research, universities adopt varied approaches to GAI policy development. To explore these variations, this study conducts a comparative analysis of leading universities in the United States, Japan, and China, examining their institution-wide policies on GAI application and governance. Based on these findings, the study proposes a University Policy Development Framework for GAI (UPDF-GAI) to provide both theoretical insights and practical guidance for universities in developing and refining their GAI policies. A qualitative content analysis of 124 policy documents from 110 universities was conducted, employing thematic coding to synthesize 20 key themes and 9 sub-themes. These themes and sub-themes formed the basis for developing the framework. The analysis reveals varying priorities and focus of GAI policy of universities in different countries. U.S. universities emphasize faculty autonomy, practical application, and policy adaptability, shaped by cutting-edge research and peer collaboration. Japanese universities take a government-regulated approach, prioritizing ethics and risk management, but provide limited support for AI implementation and flexibility. Chinese universities follow a centralized, government-led model, focusing on technology application over early policy development, while actively exploring GAI integration in education and research. The UPDF-GAI framework offers a systematic, adaptable framework for assessing and optimizing GAI policies across different educational contexts. By identifying key policy characteristics, enhancing policy effectiveness, and balancing technology, ethics, and education, enabling universities to develop sustainable, contextually relevant policies that strengthen their digital competitiveness and institutional readiness for AI-driven education."
2504.02652,"Homeland security in the United States faces a daunting task due to the multiple threats and hazards that can occur. Natural disasters, human-caused incidents such as terrorist attacks, and technological failures can result in significant damage, fatalities, injuries, and economic losses. The increasing frequency and severity of disruptive events in the United States highlight the urgent need for effectively allocating resources in homeland security and emergency preparedness. This article presents an optimization-based decision support model to help homeland security policymakers identify and select projects that best mitigate the risk of threats and hazards while satisfying a budget constraint. The model incorporates multiple hazards, probabilistic risk assessments, and multidimensional consequences and integrates historical data and publicly available sources to evaluate and select the most effective risk mitigation projects and optimize resource allocation across various disaster scenarios. We apply this model to the state of Iowa, considering 16 hazards, six types of consequences, and 52 mitigation projects. Our results demonstrate how different budget levels influence project selection, emphasizing cost-effective solutions that maximize risk reduction. Sensitivity analysis examines the robustness of project selection under varying effectiveness assumptions and consequence estimations. The findings offer critical insights for policymakers in homeland security and emergency management and provide a basis for more efficient resource allocation and improved disaster resilience."
2504.02856,"Algorithmic fairness is an expanding field that addresses a range of discrimination issues associated with algorithmic processes. However, most works in the literature focus on analyzing it only from an ethical perspective, focusing on moral principles and values that should be considered in the design and evaluation of algorithms, while disregarding the epistemic dimension related to knowledge transmission and validation. However, this aspect of algorithmic fairness should also be included in the debate, as it is crucial to introduce a specific type of harm: an individual may be systematically excluded from the dissemination of knowledge due to the attribution of a credibility deficit/excess. In this work, we specifically focus on characterizing and analyzing the impact of this credibility deficit or excess on the diffusion of innovations on a societal scale, a phenomenon driven by individual attitudes and social interactions, and also by the strength of mutual connections. Indeed, discrimination might shape the latter, ultimately modifying how innovations spread within the network. In this light, to incorporate, also from a formal point of view, the epistemic dimension in innovation diffusion models becomes paramount, especially if these models are intended to support fair policy design. For these reasons, we formalize the epistemic properties of a social environment, by extending the well-established Linear Threshold Model (LTM) in an epistemic direction to show the impact of epistemic biases in innovation diffusion. Focusing on the impact of epistemic bias in both open-loop and closed-loop scenarios featuring optimal fostering policies, our results shed light on the pivotal role the epistemic dimension might have in the debate of algorithmic fairness in decision-making."
2504.02899,"Reducing meat consumption is crucial for achieving global environmental and nutritional targets. Meat-Free Day (MFD) is a widely adopted strategy to address this challenge by encouraging plant-based diets through the removal of animal-based meals. We assessed the environmental, behavioral, and nutritional impacts of MFD by implementing 67 MFDs over 18 months (once a week on a randomly chosen day) across 12 cafeterias on a large university campus, analyzing over 400,000 food purchases. MFD reduced on-campus food-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on treated days by 52.9% and contributed to improved fiber (+26.9%) and cholesterol (-4.5%) consumption without altering caloric intake. These nutritional benefits were, however, accompanied by a 27.6% decrease in protein intake and a 34.2% increase in sugar consumption. Moreover, the increase in plant-based meals did not carry over to subsequent days, as evidenced by a 3.5% rebound in animal-based meal consumption on days immediately following treated days. MFD also led to a 16.8% drop in on-campus meal sales on treatedthis http URLCarlo simulations suggest that if 8.7% of diners were to eat burgers off-campus on treated days, MFD's GHG savings would be fully negated. As our analysis identifies on-campus customer retention as the main challenge to MFD effectiveness, we recommend combining MFD with customer retention interventions to ensure environmental and nutritional benefits."
2504.02905,"Urban environments significantly influence mental health outcomes, yet the role of an effective framework for decision-making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) for optimizing urban policies for stress reduction remains underexplored. While existing research has demonstrated the effects of urban design on mental health, there is a lack of systematic scenario-based analysis to guide urban planning decisions. This study addresses this gap by applying Scenario Discovery (SD) in urban planning to evaluate the effectiveness of urban vegetation interventions in stress reduction across different urban environments using a predictive model based on emotional responses collected from a neuroscience-based outdoor experiment in Lisbon. Combining these insights with detailed urban data from Copenhagen, we identify key intervention thresholds where vegetation-based solutions succeed or fail in mitigating stress responses. Our findings reveal that while increased vegetation generally correlates with lower stress levels, high-density urban environments, crowding, and individual psychological traits (e.g., extraversion) can reduce its effectiveness. This work showcases our Scenario Discovery framework as a systematic approach for identifying robust policy pathways in urban planning, opening the door for its exploration in other urban decision-making contexts where uncertainty and design resiliency are critical."
2504.02909,"Monitoring air quality and environmental conditions is crucial for public health and effective urban planning. Current environmental monitoring approaches often rely on centralized data collection and processing, which pose significant privacy, security, and scalability challenges. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution to these limitations by enabling collaborative model training across multiple devices without sharing raw data. This decentralized approach addresses privacy concerns while still leveraging distributed data sources. This paper provides a comprehensive review of FL applications in air quality and environmental monitoring, emphasizing its effectiveness in predicting pollutants and managing environmental data. However, the paper also identifies key limitations of FL when applied in this domain, including challenges such as communication overhead, infrastructure demands, generalizability issues, computational complexity, and security vulnerabilities. For instance, communication overhead, caused by the frequent exchange of model updates between local devices and central servers, is a notable challenge. To address this, future research should focus on optimizing communication protocols and reducing the frequency of updates to lessen the burden on network resources. Additionally, the paper suggests further research directions to refine FL frameworks and enhance their applicability in real-world environmental monitoring scenarios. By synthesizing findings from existing studies, this paper highlights the potential of FL to improve air quality management while maintaining data privacy and security, and it provides valuable insights for future developments in the field."
2504.0291,"Explainable AI (XAI) seeks to transform black-box algorithmic processes into transparent ones, enhancing trust in AI applications across various sectors such as education. This review aims to examine the various definitions of XAI within the literature and explore the challenges of XAI in education. Our goal is to shed light on how XAI can contribute to enhancing the educational field. This systematic review, utilising the PRISMA method for rigorous and transparent research, identified 19 relevant studies. Our findings reveal 15 definitions and 62 challenges. These challenges are categorised using thematic analysis into seven groups: explainability, ethical, technical, human-computer interaction (HCI), trustworthiness, policy and guideline, and others, thereby deepening our understanding of the implications of XAI in education. Our analysis highlights the absence of standardised definitions for XAI, leading to confusion, especially because definitions concerning ethics, trustworthiness, technicalities, and explainability tend to overlap and vary."
2504.02916,"Nearly every educational institution uses a learning management system (LMS), often producing terabytes of data generated by thousands of people. We examine LMS grade and login data from a regional comprehensive university, specifically documenting key considerations for engineering features from these data when trying to predict student performance. We specifically document changes to LMS data patterns since Covid-19, which are critical for data scientists to account for when using historic data. We compare numerous engineered features and approaches to utilizing those features for machine learning. We finish with a summary of the implications of including these features into more comprehensive student performance models."
2504.03255,"Agentic systems powered by large language models (LLMs) are becoming progressively more complex and capable. Their increasing agency and expanding deployment settings attract growing attention to effective governance policies, monitoring, and control protocols. Based on the emerging landscape of the agentic market, we analyze potential liability issues arising from the delegated use of LLM agents and their extended systems through a principal-agent perspective. Our analysis complements existing risk-based studies on artificial agency and covers the spectrum of important aspects of the principal-agent relationship and their potential consequences at deployment. Furthermore, we motivate method developments for technical governance along the directions of interpretability and behavior evaluations, reward and conflict management, and the mitigation of misalignment and misconduct through principled engineering of detection and fail-safe mechanisms. By illustrating the outstanding issues in AI liability for LLM-based agentic systems, we aim to inform the system design, auditing, and tracing to enhance transparency and liability attribution."
2504.03287,"E-participation platforms are an important asset for governments in increasing trust and fostering democratic societies. By engaging public and private institutions and individuals, policymakers can make informed and inclusive decisions. However, current approaches of primarily static nature struggle to integrate citizen feedback effectively. Drawing on the Media Richness Theory and applying the Design Science Research method, we explore how a chatbot can address these shortcomings to improve the decision-making abilities for primary stakeholders of e-participation platforms. Leveraging the ""Have Your Say"" platform, which solicits feedback on initiatives and regulations by the European Commission, a Large Language Model-based chatbot, called AskThePublic is created, providing policymakers, journalists, researchers, and interested citizens with a convenient channel to explore and engage with citizen input. Evaluating AskThePublic in 11 semi-structured interviews with public sector-affiliated experts, we find that the interviewees value the interactive and structured responses as well as enhanced language capabilities."
2504.03336,"The ethics of emerging technologies faces an anticipation dilemma: engaging too early risks overly speculative concerns, while engaging too late may forfeit the chance to shape a technology's trajectory. Despite various methods to address this challenge, no framework exists to assess their suitability across different stages of technological development. This paper proposes such a framework. I conceptualise two main ethical approaches: outcomes-oriented ethics, which assesses the potential consequences of a technology's materialisation, and meaning-oriented ethics, which examines how (social) meaning is attributed to a technology. I argue that the strengths and limitations of outcomes- and meaning-oriented ethics depend on the uncertainties surrounding a technology, which shift as it matures. To capture this evolution, I introduce the concept of ethics readiness: the readiness of a technology to undergo detailed ethical scrutiny. Building on the widely known Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), I propose Ethics Readiness Levels (ERLs) to illustrate how the suitability of ethical approaches evolves with a technology's development. At lower ERLs, where uncertainties are most pronounced, meaning-oriented ethics proves more effective, while at higher ERLs, as impacts become clearer, outcomes-oriented ethics gains relevance. By linking Ethics Readiness to Technology Readiness, this framework underscores that the appropriateness of ethical approaches evolves alongside technological maturity, ensuring scrutiny remains grounded and relevant. Finally, I demonstrate the practical value of this framework by applying it to quantum technologies, showing how Ethics Readiness can guide effective ethical engagement."
2504.0336,"Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices presents significant challenges due to computational constraints, memory limitations, inference speed, and energy consumption. Model quantization has emerged as a key technique to enable efficient LLM inference by reducing model size and computational overhead. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of 28 quantized LLMs from the Ollama library, which applies by default Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and weight-only quantization techniques, deployed on an edge device (Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM). We evaluate energy efficiency, inference performance, and output accuracy across multiple quantization levels and task types. Models are benchmarked on five standardized datasets (CommonsenseQA, BIG-Bench Hard, TruthfulQA, GSM8K, and HumanEval), and we employ a high-resolution, hardware-based energy measurement tool to capture real-world power consumption. Our findings reveal the trade-offs between energy efficiency, inference speed, and accuracy in different quantization settings, highlighting configurations that optimize LLM deployment for resource-constrained environments. By integrating hardware-level energy profiling with LLM benchmarking, this study provides actionable insights for sustainable AI, bridging a critical gap in existing research on energy-aware LLM deployment."
2504.03758,"Data-driven crowd simulation models offer advantages in enhancing the accuracy and realism of simulations, and improving their generalizability is essential for promoting application. Current data-driven approaches are primarily designed for a single scenario, with very few models validated across more than two scenarios. It is still an open question to develop data-driven crowd simulation models with strong generalizibility. We notice that the key to addressing this challenge lies in effectively and accurately capturing the core common influential features that govern pedestrians' navigation across diverse scenarios. Particularly, we believe that visual information is one of the most dominant influencing features. In light of this, this paper proposes a data-driven model incorporating a refined visual information extraction method and exit cues to enhance generalizability. The proposed model is examined on four common fundamental modules: bottleneck, corridor, corner and T-junction. The evaluation results demonstrate that our model performs excellently across these scenarios, aligning with pedestrian movement in real-world experiments, and significantly outperforms the classical knowledge-driven model. Furthermore, we introduce a modular approach to apply our proposed model in composite scenarios, and the results regarding trajectories and fundamental diagrams indicate that our simulations closely match real-world patterns in the composite scenario. The research outcomes can provide inspiration for the development of data-driven crowd simulation models with high generalizability and advance the application of data-driventhis http URLwork has been submitted to Elsevier for possible publication."
2504.03789,"The advancements in systems deploying large language models (LLMs), as well as improvements in their ability to act as agents with predefined templates, provide an opportunity to conduct qualitative, individualized assessments, creating a bridge between qualitative and quantitative methods for candidates seeking career progression. In this paper, we develop a platform that allows candidates to run AI-led interviews to assess their current career stage and curate coursework to enable progression to the next level. Our approach incorporates predefined career trajectories, associated skills, and a method to recommend the best resources for gaining the necessary skills for advancement. We employ OpenAI API calls along with expertly compiled chat templates to assess candidate competence. Our platform is highly configurable due to the modularity of the development, is easy to deploy and use, and available as a web interface where the only requirement is candidate resumes in PDF format. We demonstrate a use-case centered on software engineering and intend to extend this platform to be domain-agnostic, requiring only regular updates to chat templates as industries evolve."
2504.03798,"The population of older adults is steadily increasing, with a strong preference for aging-in-place rather than moving to care facilities. Consequently, supporting this growing demographic has become a significant global challenge. However, facilitating successful aging-in-place is challenging, requiring consideration of multiple factors such as data privacy, health status monitoring, and living environments to improve health outcomes. In this paper, we propose an unobtrusive sensor system designed for installation in older adults' homes. Using data from the sensors, our system constructs a digital twin, a virtual representation of events and activities that occurred in the home. The system uses neural network models and decision rules to capture residents' activities and living environments. This digital twin enables continuous health monitoring by providing actionable insights into residents' well-being. Our system is designed to be low-cost and privacy-preserving, with the aim of providing green and safe monitoring for the health of older adults. We have successfully deployed our system in two homes over a time period of two months, and our findings demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of digital twin technology in supporting independent living for older adults. This study highlights that our system could revolutionize elder care by enabling personalized interventions, such as lifestyle adjustments, medical treatments, or modifications to the residential environment, to enhance health outcomes."
2504.03805,"Maternal health literacy is associated with greater odds of positive pregnancy outcomes. There is an increasing proliferation of websites dedicated to maternal health education, but the scope and quality of their content varies widely. In this study, we analyzed the main topics covered on maternal health websites that offer content in the low-resource Kinyarwanda language (mainly spoken by 12 million Rwandans). We used web scraping to identify maternal health websites. We utilized a topic modeling, using the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm, to identify the topics. We found five main topics: (1) pregnancy danger signs, (2) child care, (3) intimacy (sex), (4) nutrition, and (5) the importance of doctor consultations. However, the articles were short and did not cater to fathers, pregnant adolescents, or those experiencing gender-based violence (GBV) or mental health challenges. This is despite 12.5\% women of reproductive age in Rwanda being victims of GBV and one in five women in low- and middle-income countries experiencing mental illness during the perinatal period. We recommend three automated tools, a topic recommender tool, culturally relevant automated articles, and website quality check tools, to guide software and health content developers."
2504.03822,"Generative large language models (LLMs) are incredibly useful, versatile, and promising tools. However, they will be of most use to political and social science researchers when they are used in a way that advances understanding about real human behaviors and concerns. To promote the scientific use of LLMs, we suggest that researchers in the political and social sciences need to remain focused on the scientific goal of inference. To this end, we discuss the challenges and opportunities related to scientific inference with LLMs, using validation of model output as an illustrative case for discussion. We propose a set of guidelines related to establishing the failure and success of LLMs when completing particular tasks, and discuss how we can make inferences from these observations. We conclude with a discussion of how this refocus will improve the accumulation of shared scientific knowledge about these tools and their uses in the social sciences."
2504.03966,"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Learning Management Systems (LMSs) has the potential to enhance task automation and accessibility in education. However, hallucination where LLMs generate inaccurate or misleading information remains a significant challenge. This study introduces the Dynamic Course Content Integration (DCCI) mechanism, which dynamically retrieves and integrates course content and curriculum from Canvas LMS into the LLM-powered assistant, Ask ME. By employing prompt engineering to structure retrieved content within the LLM's context window, DCCI ensures accuracy, relevance, and contextual alignment, mitigating hallucination. To evaluate DCCI's effectiveness, Ask ME's usability, and broader student perceptions of AI in education, a mixed-methods approach was employed, incorporating user satisfaction ratings and a structured survey. Results from a pilot study indicate high user satisfaction (4.614/5), with students recognizing Ask ME's ability to provide timely and contextually relevant responses for both administrative and course-related inquiries. Additionally, a majority of students agreed that Ask ME's integration with course content in Canvas LMS reduced platform-switching, improving usability, engagement, and comprehension. AI's role in reducing classroom hesitation and fostering self-directed learning and intellectual curiosity was also highlighted. Despite these benefits and positive perception of AI tools, concerns emerged regarding over-reliance on AI, accuracy limitations, and ethical issues such as plagiarism and reduced student-teacher interaction. These findings emphasize the need for strategic AI implementation, ethical safeguards, and a pedagogical framework that prioritizes human-AI collaboration over substitution."
2504.03971,"The SIGCHI and Social Computing research communities have been at the forefront of online safety efforts for youth, ranging from understanding the serious risks youth face online to developing evidence-based interventions for risk protection. Yet, to bring these efforts to bear, we must partner with practitioners, such as industry stakeholders who know how to bring such technologies to market, and youth service providers who work directly with youth. Therefore, we interviewed 33 stakeholders in the space of youth online safety, including industry professionals (n=12), youth service providers (n=11), and researchers (n=10) to understand where their visions toward working together to protect youth online converged and surfaced tensions, as well as how we might reconcile conflicting viewpoints to move forward as one community with synergistic expertise on how to change the current sociotechnical landscape for youth online safety. Overall, we found that non-partisan leadership is necessary to chart actionable, equitable goals to facilitate collaboration between stakeholders, combat feelings of isolation, and foster trust between the stakeholder groups. Based on these findings, we recommend the use of open-innovation methods with their inherent transparency, federated governance models, and clear but inclusive leadership structures to promote collaboration between youth online safety stakeholders. We propose the creation of an open-innovation organization that unifies the diverse voices in youth online safety to develop open-standards and evidence-based design patterns that centralize otherwise fragmented efforts that have fallen short of the goal of effective technological solutions that keep youth safe online."
2504.04058,"Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, exemplified by OpenAI's DeepResearch, autonomously pursue goals, adapting strategies through implicit learning. Unlike traditional generative AI, which is reactive to user prompts, agentic AI proactively orchestrates complex workflows. It exhibits stochastic, dynamic, and fluid autonomy: its steps and outputs vary probabilistically (stochastic), it evolves based on prior interactions (dynamic), and it operates with significant independence within human-defined parameters, adapting to context (fluid). While this fosters complex, co-evolutionary human-machine interactions capable of generating uniquely synthesized creative outputs, it also irrevocably blurs boundaries--human and machine contributions become irreducibly entangled in intertwined creative processes. Consequently, agentic AI poses significant challenges to legal frameworks reliant on clear attribution: authorship doctrines struggle to disentangle ownership, intellectual property regimes strain to accommodate recursively blended novelty, and liability models falter as accountability diffuses across shifting loci of control. The central issue is not the legal treatment of human versus machine contributions, but the fundamental unmappability--the practical impossibility in many cases--of accurately attributing specific creative elements to either source. When retroactively parsing contributions becomes infeasible, applying distinct standards based on origin becomes impracticable. Therefore, we argue, legal and policy frameworks may need to treat human and machine contributions as functionally equivalent--not for moral or economic reasons, but as a pragmatic necessity."
2504.0418,"This study investigates public expectations regarding the likelihood and timing of major artificial intelligence (AI) developments among Swedes. Through a mixed-mode survey (web/paper) of 1,026 respondents, we examined expectations across six key scenarios: medical breakthroughs, mass unemployment, democratic deterioration, living standard improvements, artificial general intelligence (AGI), and uncontrollable superintelligent AI. Findings reveal strong consensus on AI-driven medical breakthroughs (82.6%), while expectations for other major developments are significantly lower, ranging from 40.9% for mass unemployment down to 28.4% for AGI. Timeline expectations varied significantly, with major medical advances anticipated within 6-10 years, while more transformative developments like AGI were projected beyond 20 years. Latent class analysis identified three distinct groups: optimists (46.7%), ambivalents (42.2%), and skeptics (11.2%). The optimist group showed higher levels of self-rated AI knowledge and education, while gender differences were also observed across classes. The study addresses a critical gap in understanding temporal expectations of AI development among the general public, offering insights for policymakers and stakeholders."
2504.04815,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds transformative potential in education, enabling personalized learning, enhancing inclusivity, and encouraging creativity and curiosity. In this paper, we explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as both patient tutors and collaborative partners to enhance education delivery. As tutors, LLMs personalize learning by offering step-by-step explanations and addressing individual needs, making education more inclusive for students with diverse backgrounds or abilities. As collaborators, they expand students' horizons, supporting them in tackling complex, real-world problems and co-creating innovative projects. However, to fully realize these benefits, LLMs must be leveraged not as tools for providing direct solutions but rather to guide students in developing resolving strategies and finding learning paths together. Therefore, a strong emphasis should be placed on educating students and teachers on the successful use of LLMs to ensure their effective integration into classrooms. Through practical examples and real-world case studies, this paper illustrates how LLMs can make education more inclusive and engaging while empowering students to reach their full potential."
2504.04872,"Meat reduction benefits human and planetary health, but social norms keep meat central in shared meals. To date, the development of communication strategies that promote meat reduction while minimizing social costs has required the costly involvement of human participants at each stage of the process. We present work in progress on simulating multi-round dialogues on meat reduction between Generative Agents based on large language models (LLMs). We measure our main outcome using established psychological questionnaires based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and additionally investigate Social Costs. We find evidence that our preliminary simulations produce outcomes that are (i) consistent with theoretical expectations; and (ii) valid when compared to data from previous studies with human participants. Generative agent-based models are a promising tool for identifying novel communication strategies on meat reduction -- tailored to highly specific participant groups -- to then be tested in subsequent studies with human participants."
2504.05007,"AI Impact Assessments are only as good as the measures used to assess the impact of these systems. It is therefore paramount that we can justify our choice of metrics in these assessments, especially for difficult to quantify ethical and social values. We present a two-step approach to ensure metrics are properly motivated. First, a conception needs to be spelled out (e.g. Rawlsian fairness or fairness as solidarity) and then a metric can be fitted to that conception. Both steps require separate justifications, as conceptions can be judged on how well they fit with the function of, for example, fairness. We argue that conceptual engineering offers helpful tools for this step. Second, metrics need to be fitted to a conception. We illustrate this process through an examination of competing fairness metrics to illustrate that here the additional content that a conception offers helps us justify the choice for a specific metric. We thus advocate that impact assessments are not only clear on their metrics, but also on the conceptions that motivate those metrics."
2504.0521,"Machine learning (ML) systems are vulnerable to performance decline over time due to dataset shift. To address this problem, experts often suggest that ML systems should be regularly updated to ensure ongoing performance stability. Some scholarly literature has begun to address the epistemic and ethical challenges associated with different updating methodologies. Thus far, however, little attention has been paid to the impact of model updating on the ML-assisted decision-making process itself, particularly in the AI ethics and AI epistemology literatures. This article aims to address this gap in the literature. It argues that model updating introduces a new sub-type of opacity into ML-assisted decision-making -- update opacity -- that occurs when users cannot understand how or why an update has changed the reasoning or behaviour of an ML system. This type of opacity presents a variety of distinctive epistemic and safety concerns that available solutions to the black box problem in ML are largely ill-equipped to address. A variety of alternative strategies may be developed or pursued to address the problem of update opacity more directly, including bi-factual explanations, dynamic model reporting, and update compatibility. However, each of these strategies presents its own risks or carries significant limitations. Further research will be needed to address the epistemic and safety concerns associated with model updating and update opacity going forward."
2504.05273,"This systematic review examines peer-reviewed studies on application of GPT in business management, revealing significant knowledge gaps. Despite identifying interesting research directions such as best practices, benchmarking, performance comparisons, social impacts, our analysis yields only 42 relevant studies for the 22 months since its release. There are so few studies looking at a particular sector or subfield that management researchers, business consultants, policymakers, and journalists do not yet have enough information to make well-founded statements on how GPT is being used in businesses. The primary contribution of this paper is a call to action for further research. We provide a description of current research and identify knowledge gaps on the use of GPT in business. We cover the management subfields of finance, marketing, human resources, strategy, operations, production, and analytics, excluding retail and sales. We discuss gaps in knowledge of GPT potential consequences on employment, productivity, environmental costs, oppression, and small businesses. We propose how management consultants and the media can help fill those gaps. We call for practical work on business control systems as they relate to existing and foreseeable AI-related business challenges. This work may be of interest to managers, to management researchers, and to people working on AI in society."
2504.05331,"As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes embedded in healthcare, trust in medical decision-making is changing fast. Nowhere is this shift more visible than in radiology, where AI tools are increasingly embedded across the imaging workflow - from scheduling and acquisition to interpretation, reporting, and communication with referrers and patients. This opinion paper argues that trust in AI isn't a simple transfer from humans to machines - it is a dynamic, evolving relationship that must be built and maintained. Rather than debating whether AI belongs in medicine, it asks: what kind of trust must AI earn, and how? Drawing from philosophy, bioethics, and system design, it explores the key differences between human trust and machine reliability - emphasizing transparency, accountability, and alignment with the values of good care. It argues that trust in AI should not be built on mimicking empathy or intuition, but on thoughtful design, responsible deployment, and clear moral responsibility. The goal is a balanced view - one that avoids blind optimism and reflexive fear. Trust in AI must be treated not as a given, but as something to be earned over time."
2504.05333,"Decisions to deploy AI capabilities are often driven by counterfactuals - a comparison of decisions made using AI to decisions that would have been made if the AI were not used. Counterfactual misses, which are poor decisions that are attributable to using AI, may have disproportionate disutility to AI deployment decision makers. Counterfactual hits, which are good decisions attributable to AI usage, may provide little benefit beyond the benefit of better decisions. This paper explores how to include counterfactual outcomes into usage decision expected utility assessments. Several properties emerge when counterfactuals are explicitly included. First, there are many contexts where the expected utility of AI usage is positive for intended beneficiaries and strongly negative for stakeholders and deployment decision makers. Second, high levels of complementarity, where differing AI and user assessments are merged beneficially, often leads to substantial disutility for stakeholders. Third, apparently small changes in how users interact with an AI capability can substantially impact stakeholder utility. Fourth, cognitive biases such as expert overconfidence and hindsight bias exacerbate the perceived frequency of costly counterfactual misses. The expected utility assessment approach presented here is intended to help AI developers and deployment decision makers to navigate the subtle but substantial impact of counterfactuals so as to better ensure that beneficial AI capabilities are used."
2504.05449,"As generative AI (GenAI) models are increasingly explored for educational applications, understanding educator preferences for AI-generated lesson plans is critical for their effective integration into K-12 instruction. This exploratory study compares lesson plans authored by human curriculum designers, a fine-tuned LLaMA-2-13b model trained on K-12 content, and a customized GPT-4 model to evaluate their pedagogical quality across multiple instructional measures: warm-up activities, main tasks, cool-down activities, and overall quality. Using a large-scale preference study with K-12 math educators, we examine how preferences vary across grade levels and instructional components. We employ both qualitative and quantitative analyses. The raw preference results indicate that human-authored lesson plans are generally favored, particularly for elementary education, where educators emphasize student engagement, scaffolding, and collaborative learning. However, AI-generated models demonstrate increasing competitiveness in cool-down tasks and structured learning activities, particularly in high school settings. Beyond quantitative results, we conduct thematic analysis using LDA and manual coding to identify key factors influencing educator preferences. Educators value human-authored plans for their nuanced differentiation, real-world contextualization, and student discourse facilitation. Meanwhile, AI-generated lesson plans are often praised for their structure and adaptability for specific instructional tasks. Findings suggest a human-AI collaborative approach to lesson planning, where GenAI can serve as an assistive tool rather than a replacement for educator expertise in lesson planning. This study contributes to the growing discourse on responsible AI integration in education, highlighting both opportunities and challenges in leveraging GenAI for curriculum development."
2504.06294,"Formulating research questions is a foundational yet challenging academic skill, one that generative AI systems often oversimplify by offering instant answers at the expense of student reflection. This protocol lays out a study grounded in constructivist learning theory to evaluate a novel AI-based Socratic Tutor, designed to foster cognitive engagement and scaffold research question development in higher education. Anchored in dialogic pedagogy, the tutor engages students through iterative, reflective questioning, aiming to promote System 2 thinking and counteract overreliance on AI-generated outputs. In a quasi-experimental design, approximately 80 German pre-service biology teacher students will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: an AI Socratic Tutor condition and an uninstructed chatbot control. Across multiple cycles, students are expected to formulate research questions based on background texts, with quality assessed through double-blind expert review. The study also examines transfer of skills to novel phenomena and captures student perceptions through mixed-methods analysis, including surveys, interviews and reflective journals. This study aims to advance the understanding of how generative AI can be pedagogically aligned to support, not replace, human cognition and offers design principles for human-AI collaboration in education."
2504.06296,"As artificial intelligence (AI) grows in popularity and importance-both as a domain within broader computing research and in society at large-increasing focus will need to be paid to the ethical governance of this emerging technology. The attitudes and competencies with respect to AI ethics and policy among post-secondary students studying computer science (CS) are of particular interest, as many of these students will go on to play key roles in the development and deployment of future AI innovations. Despite this population of computer scientists being at the forefront of learning about and using AI tools, their attitudes towards AI remain understudied in the literature. In an effort to begin to close this gap, in fall 2024 we fielded a survey ($n=117$) to undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in CS courses at a large public university in the United States to assess their attitudes towards the nascent fields of AI ethics and policy. Additionally, we conducted one-on-one follow-up interviews with 13 students to elicit more in-depth responses on topics such as the use of AI tools in the classroom, ethical impacts of AI, and government regulation of AI. In this paper, we describe the findings of both the survey and interviews, drawing parallels and contrasts to broader public opinion polling in the United States. We conclude by evaluating the implications of CS student attitudes on the future of AI education and governance."
2504.06303,"Understanding and mitigating biases is critical for the adoption of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes decision-making. We introduce Admissions and Hiring, decision tasks with hypothetical applicant profiles where a person's race can be inferred from their name, as simplified test beds for racial bias. We show that Gemma 2B Instruct and LLaMA 3.2 3B Instruct exhibit strong biases. Gemma grants admission to 26% more White than Black applicants, and LLaMA hires 60% more Asian than White applicants. We demonstrate that these biases are resistant to prompt engineering: multiple prompting strategies all fail to promote fairness. In contrast, using distributed alignment search, we can identify ""race subspaces"" within model activations and intervene on them to debias model decisions. Averaging the representation across all races within the subspaces reduces Gemma's bias by 37-57%. Finally, we examine the generalizability of Gemma's race subspaces, and find limited evidence for generalization, where changing the prompt format can affect the race representation. Our work suggests mechanistic approaches may provide a promising venue for improving the fairness of LLMs, but a universal race representation remains elusive."
2504.06322,"This chapter critiques the dominant reductionist approach in AI and work studies, which isolates tasks and skills as replaceable components. Instead, it advocates for a systemic perspective that emphasizes the interdependence of tasks, roles, and workplace contexts. Two complementary approaches are proposed: an ethnographic, context-rich method that highlights how AI reconfigures work environments and expertise; and a relational task-based analysis that bridges micro-level work descriptions with macro-level labor trends. The authors argue that effective AI impact assessments must go beyond predicting automation rates to include ethical, well-being, and expertise-related questions. Drawing on empirical case studies, they demonstrate how AI reshapes human-technology relations, professional roles, and tacit knowledge practices. The chapter concludes by calling for a human-centric, holistic framework that guides organizational and policy decisions, balancing technological possibilities with social desirability and sustainability of work."
2504.06324,"As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into our daily lives, it becomes crucial to understand their implicit biases and moral tendencies. To address this, we introduce a Moral Foundations LLM dataset (MFD-LLM) grounded in Moral Foundations Theory, which conceptualizes human morality through six core foundations. We propose a novel evaluation method that captures the full spectrum of LLMs' revealed moral preferences by answering a range of real-world moral dilemmas. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art models have remarkably homogeneous value preferences, yet demonstrate a lack of consistency."
2504.06435,"Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power generative search engines which, in turn, drive human information seeking and decision making at scale. The extent to which humans trust generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can therefore influence what we buy, how we vote and our health. Unfortunately, no work establishes the causal effect of generative search designs on human trust. Here we execute ~12,000 search queries across seven countries, generating ~80,000 real-time GenAI and traditional search results, to understand the extent of current global exposure to GenAI search. We then use a preregistered, randomized experiment on a large study sample representative of the U.S. population to show that while participants trust GenAI search less than traditional search on average, reference links and citations significantly increase trust in GenAI, even when those links and citations are incorrect or hallucinated. Uncertainty highlighting, which reveals GenAI's confidence in its own conclusions, makes us less willing to trust and share generative information whether that confidence is high or low. Positive social feedback increases trust in GenAI while negative feedback reduces trust. These results imply that GenAI designs can increase trust in inaccurate and hallucinated information and reduce trust when GenAI's certainty is made explicit. Trust in GenAI varies by topic and with users' demographics, education, industry employment and GenAI experience, revealing which sub-populations are most vulnerable to GenAI misrepresentations. Trust, in turn, predicts behavior, as those who trust GenAI more click more and spend less time evaluating GenAI search results. These findings suggest directions for GenAI design to safely and productively address the AI ""trust gap."""
2504.06549,"Foundation models that are capable of automating cognitive tasks represent a pivotal technological shift, yet their societal implications remain unclear. These systems promise exciting advances, yet they also risk flooding our information ecosystem with formulaic, homogeneous, and potentially misleading synthetic content. Developing benchmarks grounded in real use cases where these risks are most significant is therefore critical. Through a thematic analysis using 2 million language model user prompts, we identify creative composition tasks as a prevalent usage category where users seek help with personal tasks that require everyday creativity. Our fine-grained analysis identifies mismatches between current benchmarks and usage patterns among these tasks. Crucially, we argue that the same use cases that currently lack thorough evaluations can lead to negative downstream impacts. This position paper argues that benchmarks focused on creative composition tasks is a necessary step towards understanding the societal harms of AI-generated content. We call for greater transparency in usage patterns to inform the development of new benchmarks that can effectively measure both the progress and the impacts of models with creative capabilities."
2504.06928,"As generative AI rapidly integrates into educational infrastructures worldwide, it transforms how knowledge gets created, validated, and shared, yet current discourse inadequately addresses its implications as epistemic infrastructure mediating teaching and learning. This paper investigates how AI systems function as epistemic infrastructures in education and their impact on human epistemic agency. Adopting a situated cognition perspective and following a value-sensitive design approach, the study conducts a technical investigation of two representative AI systems in educational settings, analyzing their impact on teacher practice across three dimensions: affordances for skilled epistemic actions, support for epistemic sensitivity, and implications for long-term habit formation. The analysis reveals that current AI systems inadequately support teachers' skilled epistemic actions, insufficiently foster epistemic sensitivity, and potentially cultivate problematic habits that prioritize efficiency over epistemic agency. To address these challenges, the paper recommends recognizing the infrastructural transformation occurring in education, developing AI environments that stimulate skilled actions while upholding epistemic norms, and involving educators in AI design processes -- recommendations aimed at fostering AI integration that aligns with core educational values and maintains human epistemic agency."
2504.06976,"Social media platforms face heightened risks during major political events; yet, how platforms adapt their moderation practices in response remains unclear. The Digital Services Act Transparency Database offers an unprecedented opportunity to systematically study content moderation at scale, enabling researchers and policymakers to assess platforms' compliance and effectiveness. Herein, we analyze 1.58 billion self-reported moderation actions taken by eight large social media platforms during an extended period of eight months surrounding the 2024 European Parliament elections. Our findings reveal a lack of adaptation in moderation strategies, as platforms did not exhibit significant changes in their enforcement behaviors surrounding the elections. This raises concerns about whether platforms adapted their moderation practices at all, or if structural limitations of the database concealed possible adjustments. Moreover, we found that noted transparency and accountability issues persist nearly a year after initial concerns were raised. These results highlight the limitations of current self-regulatory approaches and underscore the need for stronger enforcement and data access mechanisms to ensure that online platforms uphold their responsibility in safeguarding democratic processes."
2504.07118,"This study examines religious biases in AI-generated financial advice, focusing on ChatGPT's responses to financial queries. Using a prompt-based methodology and content analysis, we find that 50% of the financial emails generated by ChatGPT exhibit religious biases, with explicit biases present in both ingroup and outgroup interactions. While ingroup biases personalize responses based on religious alignment, outgroup biases introduce religious framing that may alienate clients or create ideological friction. These findings align with broader research on AI bias and suggest that ChatGPT is not merely reflecting societal biases but actively shaping financial discourse based on perceived religious identity. Using the Critical Algorithm Studies framework, we argue that ChatGPT functions as a mediator of financial narratives, selectively reinforcing religious perspectives. This study underscores the need for greater transparency, bias mitigation strategies, and regulatory oversight to ensure neutrality in AI-driven financial services."
2504.07121,"The background to this paper is that in our world of massively increasing personal digital data any control over the data about me seems illusionary - informational privacy seems a lost cause. On the other hand, the production of this digital data seems a necessary component of our present life in the industrialized world. A framework for a resolution of this apparent dilemma is provided if by the distinction between (meaningless) data and (meaningful) information. I argue that computational data processing is necessary for many present-day processes and not a breach of privacy, while collection and processing of private information is often not necessary and a breach of privacy. The problem and the sketch of its solution are illustrated in a case-study: supermarket customer cards."
2504.07125,"Self-regulated learning (SRL) and Artificial-Intelligence (AI) literacy are becoming key competencies for successful human-AI interactive learning, vital to future education. However, despite their importance, students face imbalanced and underdeveloped SRL and AI literacy capabilities, inhibiting effective using AI for learning. This study analyzed data from 1,704 Chinese undergraduates using clustering methods to uncover four learner groups reflecting developing process(Potential, Development, Master, and AI-Inclined) characterized by varying SRL and AI literacy differentiation. Results highlight obvious disparities in SRL and AI literacy synchronization, with the Master Group achieving balanced development and critical AI-using for SRL, while AI-Inclined Group demonstrate over-reliance on AI and poor SRL application. The Potential Group showed a close mutual promotion trend between SRL and AI literacy, while the Development Group showed a discrete correlation. Resources and instructional guidance support emerged as key factors affecting these differentiations. To translate students to master SRL-AI literacy level and progress within it, the study proposes differentiated support strategies and suggestions. Synergizing SRL and AI literacy growth is the core of development, ensuring equitable and advanced human-centered interactive learning models for future human-AI integrating."
2504.07149,"This study presents the design and development of the 21st Century Teacher Educator for Ghana GPT, a customized Generative AI (GenAI) tool created using OpenAI's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Interactive Semi-Automated Prompting Strategy (ISA). Anchored in a Glocalized design approach, this tool supports pre-service teachers (PSTs) in Ghana by embedding localized linguistic, cultural, and curricular content within globally aligned principles of ethical and responsible AI use. The model utilizes structured, preloaded datasets-including Ghana's National Teacher Education Curriculum Framework (NTECF), UNESCO's (2023) AI guidelines, and culturally responsive pedagogies-to offer curriculum-aligned, linguistically adaptive, and pedagogically grounded learning support. The ISA enables users to input their institution, year, and semester, generating tailored academic content such as lecture notes, assessment practice, practicum resources, and action research guidance. The design incorporates the Culture and Context-Aware Framework, GenAI-CRSciA, and frameworks addressing GenAI neocolonialism to ensure equity, curriculum fidelity, and local relevance. Pilot implementation revealed notable strengths in language adaptation and localization, delivering bilingual support in English and Ghanaian languages like Twi, Dagbani, Mampruli, and Dagaare, with contextualized examples for deeper understanding. The GPT also generated practice assessments aligned with course objectives, reinforcing learner engagement. Challenges included occasional hallucinations due to limited corpora in some indigenous languages and access barriers tied to premium subscriptions. This design case contributes to discourse on Glocalized GenAI and calls for collaboration with OpenAI NextGen to expand access and empirically assess usage across diverse African educational contexts."
2504.0716,"Student dropout is a global issue influenced by personal, familial, and academic factors, with varying rates across countries. This paper introduces an AI-driven predictive modeling approach to identify students at risk of dropping out using advanced machine learning techniques. The goal is to enable timely interventions and improve educational outcomes. Our methodology is adaptable across different educational systems and levels. By employing a rigorous evaluation framework, we assess model performance and use Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to identify key factors influencing predictions. The approach was tested on real data provided by the Moroccan Ministry of National Education, achieving 88% accuracy, 88% recall, 86% precision, and an AUC of 87%. These results highlight the effectiveness of the AI models in identifying at-risk students. The framework is adaptable, incorporating historical data for both short and long-term detection, offering a comprehensive solution to the persistent challenge of student dropout."
2504.07233,"Rapid technological advancements pose a significant threat to a large portion of the global workforce, potentially leaving them behind. In today's economy, there is a stark contrast between the high demand for skilled labour and the limited employment opportunities available to those who are not adequately prepared for the digital economy. To address this critical juncture and gain a deeper and more rapid understanding of labour market dynamics, in this paper, we approach the problem of skill need forecasting as a knowledge graph (KG) completion task, specifically, temporal link prediction. We introduce our novel temporal KG constructed from online job advertisements. We then train and evaluate different temporal KG embeddings for temporal link prediction. Finally, we present predictions of demand for a selection of skills practiced by workers in the information technology industry.

2504.07312,"A growing trend in financial technology (fintech) is the use of mobile phone data and machine learning (ML) to provide credit scores- and subsequently, opportunities to access loans- to groups left out of traditional banking. This paper draws on interview data with leaders, investors, and data scientists at fintech companies developing ML-based alternative lending apps in low- and middle-income countries to explore financial inclusion and gender implications. More specifically, it examines how the underlying logics, design choices, and management decisions of ML-based alternative lending tools by fintechs embed or challenge gender biases, and consequently influence gender equity in access to finance. Findings reveal developers follow 'gender blind' approaches, grounded in beliefs that ML is objective and data reflects the truth. This leads to a lack of grappling with the ways data, features for creditworthiness, and access to apps are gendered. Overall, tools increase access to finance, but not gender equitably: Interviewees report less women access loans and receive lower amounts than men, despite being better repayers. Fintechs identify demand- and supply-side reasons for gender differences, but frame them as outside their responsibility. However, that women are observed as better repayers reveals a market inefficiency and potential discriminatory effect, further linked to profit optimization objectives. This research introduces the concept of encoded gender norms, whereby without explicit attention to the gendered nature of data and algorithmic design, AI tools reproduce existing inequalities. In doing so, they reinforce gender norms as self-fulfilling prophecies. The idea that AI is inherently objective and, when left alone, 'fair', is seductive and misleading. In reality, algorithms reflect the perspectives, priorities, and values of the people and institutions that design them."
2504.07516,"As AI systems increasingly influence critical sectors like telecommunications, finance, healthcare, and public services, ensuring fairness in decision-making is essential to prevent biased or unjust outcomes that disproportionately affect vulnerable entities or result in adverse impacts. This need is particularly pressing as the industry approaches the 6G era, where AI will drive complex functions like autonomous network management and hyper-personalized services. The TEC Standard for Fairness Assessment and Rating of AI Systems provides guidelines for evaluating fairness in AI, focusing primarily on tabular data and supervised learning models. However, as AI applications diversify, this standard requires enhancement to strengthen its impact and broaden its applicability. This paper proposes an expansion of the TEC Standard to include fairness assessments for images, unstructured text, and generative AI, including large language models, ensuring a more comprehensive approach that keeps pace with evolving AI technologies. By incorporating these dimensions, the enhanced framework will promote responsible and trustworthy AI deployment across various sectors."
2504.07676,"Receiving negative sentiment, offensive comments, or even hate speech is a constant part of the working experience of content creators (CCs) on YouTube - a growing occupational group in the platform economy. This study investigates how socio-structural characteristics such as the age, gender, and race of CCs but also platform features including the number of subscribers, community strength, and the channel topic shape differences in the occurrence of these phenomena on that platform. Drawing on a random sample of n=3,695 YouTube channels from German-speaking countries, we conduct a comprehensive analysis combining digital trace data, enhanced with hand-coded variables to include socio-structural characteristics in social media data. Publicly visible negative sentiment, offensive language, and hate speech are detected with machine- and deep-learning methods using N=40,000,000 comments. Contrary to existing studies our findings indicate that female content creators are confronted with less negative communication. Notably, our analysis reveals that while BIPoC, who work as CCs, receive significantly more negative sentiment, they aren't exposed to more offensive comments or hate speech. Additionally, platform characteristics also play a crucial role, as channels publishing content on conspiracy theories or politics are more frequently subject to negative communication."
2504.07763,"Recently, a growing number of experts in artificial intelligence (AI) and medicine have be-gun to suggest that the use of AI systems, particularly machine learning (ML) systems, is likely to humanise the practice of medicine by substantially improving the quality of clinician-patient relationships. In this thesis, however, I argue that medical ML systems are more likely to negatively impact these relationships than to improve them. In particular, I argue that the use of medical ML systems is likely to comprise the quality of trust, care, empathy, understanding, and communication between clinicians and patients."
2504.07811,"Emerging research on human-centered learning analytics (HCLA) has demonstrated the importance of involving diverse stakeholders in co-designing learning analytics (LA) systems. However, there is still a demand for effective and efficient methods to co-design LA dashboards and indicators. Indicator Specification Cards (ISCs) have been introduced recently to facilitate the systematic co-design of indicators by different LA stakeholders. In this paper, we strive to enhance the user experience and usefulness of the ISC-based indicator design process. Towards this end, we present the systematic design, implementation, and evaluation details of the ISC Creator, an interactive LA tool that allows low-cost and flexible design of LA indicators. Our findings demonstrate the importance of carefully considered interactivity and recommendations for orienting and supporting non-expert LA stakeholders to design custom LA indicators."
2504.08446,"Current intellectual property frameworks struggle to evaluate the novelty of AI-generated content, relying on subjective assessments ill-suited for comparing effectively infinite AI outputs against prior art. This paper introduces a robust, quantitative methodology grounded in Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to measure distributional differences between generative processes. By comparing entire output distributions rather than conducting pairwise similarity checks, our approach directly contrasts creative processes--overcoming the computational challenges inherent in evaluating AI outputs against unbounded prior art corpora. Through experiments combining kernel mean embeddings with domain-specific machine learning representations (LeNet-5 for MNIST digits, CLIP for art), we demonstrate exceptional sensitivity: our method distinguishes MNIST digit classes with 95% confidence using just 5-6 samples and differentiates AI-generated art from human art in the AI-ArtBench dataset (n=400 per category; p<0.0001) using as few as 7-10 samples per distribution despite human evaluators' limited discrimination ability (58% accuracy). These findings challenge the ""stochastic parrot"" hypothesis by providing empirical evidence that AI systems produce outputs from semantically distinct distributions rather than merely replicating training data. Our approach bridges technical capabilities with legal doctrine, offering a pathway to modernize originality assessments while preserving intellectual property law's core objectives. This research provides courts and policymakers with a computationally efficient, legally relevant tool to quantify AI novelty--a critical advancement as AI blurs traditional authorship and inventorship boundaries."
2504.08526,"Generative AI is increasingly used in scientific domains, from protein folding to climate modeling. But these models produce distinctive errors known as hallucinations - outputs that are incorrect yet superficially plausible. Worse, some arguments suggest that hallucinations are an inevitable consequence of the mechanisms underlying generative inference. Fortunately, such arguments rely on a conception of hallucination defined solely with respect to internal properties of the model, rather than in reference to the empirical target system. This conception fails to distinguish epistemically benign errors from those that threaten scientific inference. I introduce the concept of corrosive hallucination to capture the epistemically troubling subclass: misrepresentations that are substantively misleading and resistant to systematic anticipation. I argue that although corrosive hallucinations do pose a threat to scientific reliability, they are not inevitable. Scientific workflows such as those surrounding AlphaFold and GenCast, both of which serve as case studies, can neutralize their effects by imposing theoretical constraints during training, and by strategically screening for errors at inference time. When embedded in such workflows, generative AI can reliably contribute to scientific knowledge."
2504.08777,"The scientific discourse surrounding Chronic Lyme Disease (CLD) and Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS) has evolved over the past twenty-five years into a complex and polarised debate, shaped by shifting research priorities, institutional influences, and competing explanatory models. This study presents the first large-scale, systematic examination of this discourse using an innovative hybrid AI-driven methodology, combining large language models with structured human validation to analyse thousands of scholarly abstracts spanning 25 years. By integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with expert oversight, we developed a quantitative framework for tracking epistemic shifts in contested medical fields, with applications to other content analysis domains. Our analysis revealed a progressive transition from infection-based models of Lyme disease to immune-mediated explanations for persistent symptoms. This study offers new empirical insights into the structural and epistemic forces shaping Lyme disease research, providing a scalable and replicable methodology for analysing discourse, while underscoring the value of AI-assisted methodologies in social science and medical research."
2504.08804,"Estimating item difficulty through field-testing is often resource-intensive and time-consuming. As such, there is strong motivation to develop methods that can predict item difficulty at scale using only the item content. Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a new frontier for this goal. The present research examines the feasibility of using an LLM to predict item difficulty for K-5 mathematics and reading assessment items (N = 5170). Two estimation approaches were implemented: (a) a direct estimation method that prompted the LLM to assign a single difficulty rating to each item, and (b) a feature-based strategy where the LLM extracted multiple cognitive and linguistic features, which were then used in ensemble tree-based models (random forests and gradient boosting) to predict difficulty. Overall, direct LLM estimates showed moderate to strong correlations with true item difficulties. However, their accuracy varied by grade level, often performing worse for early grades. In contrast, the feature-based method yielded stronger predictive accuracy, with correlations as high as r = 0.87 and lower error estimates compared to both direct LLM predictions and baseline regressors. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs in streamlining item development and reducing reliance on extensive field testing and underscore the importance of structured feature extraction. We provide a seven-step workflow for testing professionals who would want to implement a similar item difficulty estimation approach with their item pool."
2504.08817,"Generative AI has recently had a profound impact on various fields, including daily life, research, and education. To explore its efficient utilization in data-driven materials science, we organized a hackathon -- AIMHack2024 -- in July 2024. In this hackathon, researchers from fields such as materials science, information science, bioinformatics, and condensed matter physics worked together to explore how generative AI can facilitate research and education. Based on the results of the hackathon, this paper presents topics related to (1) conducting AI-assisted software trials, (2) building AI tutors for software, and (3) developing GUI applications for software. While generative AI continues to evolve rapidly, this paper provides an early record of its application in data-driven materials science and highlights strategies for integrating AI into research and education."
2504.08832,"The availability and abundance of GenAI tools to administer tasks traditionally managed by people have raised concerns, particularly within the education and academic sectors, as some students may highly rely on these tools to complete the assignments designed to enable learning. This article focuses on informing students about the significance of investing their time during their studies on developing essential life-long learning skills using their own critical thinking, rather than depending on AI models that are susceptible to misinformation, hallucination, and bias. As we transition to an AI-centric era, it is important to educate students on how these models work, their pitfalls, and the ethical concerns associated with feeding data to such tools."
2504.08834,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), initially developed for military applications, are now used in various fields. As UAVs become more common across multiple industries, it is crucial to understand how to adopt them effectively, efficiently, and safely. The utilization of UAVs in healthcare and emergency services has evolved significantly in recent years, with these aerial vehicles potentially contributing to increased survival rates and enhanced healthcare services.This paper presents a two-stage systematic literature review, including a tertiary study of 15 review papers and an in-depth assessment of 136 primary publications focused on using UAVs in healthcare and emergency services. The research demonstrates how civilian UAVs have been used in numerous applications, such as healthcare emergencies, medical supply delivery, and disaster management, for diverse use cases such as Automated External Defibrillator (AED) delivery, blood delivery, and search and rescue.The studies indicate that UAVs significantly improve response times in emergency situations, enhance survival rates by ensuring the timely delivery of critical medical supplies such as AEDs, and prove to be cost-effective alternatives to traditional delivery methods, especially in remote or inaccessible areas. The studies also highlight the need for ongoing research and development to address existing challenges, such as regulatory frameworks, security, privacy and safety concerns, infrastructure development, and ethical and social issues. Effectively understanding and tackling these challenges is essential for maximizing the benefits of UAV technology in healthcare and emergency services, ultimately leading to safer, more resilient, and responsive systems that can better serve public health needs."
2504.08846,"We introduce AI University (AI-U), a flexible framework for AI-driven course content delivery that adapts to instructors' teaching styles. At its core, AI-U fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to generate instructor-aligned responses from lecture videos, notes, and textbooks. Using a graduate-level finite-element-method (FEM) course as a case study, we present a scalable pipeline to systematically construct training data, fine-tune an open-source LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and optimize its responses through RAG-based synthesis. Our evaluation - combining cosine similarity, LLM-based assessment, and expert review - demonstrates strong alignment with course materials. We also have developed a prototype web application, available atthis https URL, that enhances traceability by linking AI-generated responses to specific sections of the relevant course material and time-stamped instances of the open-access video lectures. Our expert model is found to have greater cosine similarity with a reference on 86% of test cases. An LLM judge also found our expert model to outperform the base Llama 3.2 model approximately four times out of five. AI-U offers a scalable approach to AI-assisted education, paving the way for broader adoption in higher education. Here, our framework has been presented in the setting of a class on FEM - a subject that is central to training PhD and Master students in engineering science. However, this setting is a particular instance of a broader context: fine-tuning LLMs to research content in science."
2504.08849,"Cognitive attributes are fundamental to metacognition, shaping how individuals process information, evaluate choices, and make decisions. To develop metacognitive artificial intelligence (AI) models that reflect human reasoning, it is essential to account for the attributes that influence reasoning patterns and decision-maker behavior, often leading to different or even conflicting choices. This makes it crucial to incorporate cognitive attributes in designing AI models that align with human decision-making processes, especially in high-stakes domains such as finance, where decisions have significant real-world consequences. However, existing AI alignment research has primarily focused on value alignment, often overlooking the role of individual cognitive attributes that distinguish decision-makers. To address this issue, this paper (1) analyzes the literature on cognitive attributes, (2) establishes five criteria for defining them, and (3) categorizes 19 domain-specific cognitive attributes relevant to financial decision-making. These three components provide a strong basis for developing AI systems that accurately reflect and align with human decision-making processes in financial contexts."
2504.08853,"The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems exhibiting complex and seemingly agentive behaviours necessitates a critical philosophical examination of their agency, autonomy, and moral status. In this paper we undertake a systematic analysis of the differences between basic, autonomous, and moral agency in artificial systems. We argue that while current AI systems are highly sophisticated, they lack genuine agency and autonomy because: they operate within rigid boundaries of pre-programmed objectives rather than exhibiting true goal-directed behaviour within their environment; they cannot authentically shape their engagement with the world; and they lack the critical self-reflection and autonomy competencies required for full autonomy. Nonetheless, we do not rule out the possibility of future systems that could achieve a limited form of artificial moral agency without consciousness through hybrid approaches to ethical decision-making. This leads us to suggest, by appealing to the necessity of consciousness for moral patiency, that such non-conscious AMAs might represent a case that challenges traditional assumptions about the necessary connection between moral agency and moral patiency."
2504.08855,"This paper explores how artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are transforming the global labor market. Human workers, limited to a 33% duty cycle due to rest and holidays, cost $14 to $55 per hour. In contrast, digital labor operates nearly 24/7 at just $0.10 to $0.50 per hour. We examine sectors like healthcare, education, manufacturing, and retail, finding that 40-70% of tasks could be automated. Yet, human skills like emotional intelligence and adaptability remain essential. Humans process 5,000-20,000 tokens (units of information) per hour, while AI far exceeds this, though its energy use-3.5 to 7 times higher than humans-could offset 20-40% of cost savings. Using real-world examples, such as AI in journalism and law, we illustrate these dynamics and propose six strategies-like a 4-day workweek and retraining-to ensure a fair transition to an AI-driven economy."
2504.08856,"Extracting key concepts and their relationships from course information and materials facilitates the provision of visualizations and recommendations for learners who need to select the right courses to take from a large number of courses. However, identifying and extracting themes manually is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Previous machine learning-based methods to extract relevant concepts from courses heavily rely on detailed course materials, which necessitates labor-intensive preparation of course materials. This paper investigates the potential of LLMs such as GPT in automatically generating course concepts and their relations. Specifically, we design a suite of prompts and provide GPT with the course information with different levels of detail, thereby generating high-quality course concepts and identifying their relations. Furthermore, we comprehensively evaluate the quality of the generated concepts and relationships through extensive experiments. Our results demonstrate the viability of LLMs as a tool for supporting educational content selection and delivery."
2504.08863,"LLMs as intelligent agents are being increasingly applied in scenarios where human interactions are involved, leading to a critical concern about whether LLMs are faithful to the variations in culture across regions. Several works have investigated this question in various ways, finding that there are biases present in the cultural representations of LLM outputs. To gain a more comprehensive view, in this work, we conduct the first large-scale evaluation of LLM culture assessing 20 countries' cultures and languages across ten LLMs. With a renowned cultural values questionnaire and by carefully analyzing LLM output with human ground truth scores, we thoroughly study LLMs' cultural alignment across countries and among individual models. Our findings show that the output over all models represents a moderate cultural middle ground. Given the overall skew, we propose an alignment metric, revealing that the United States is the best-aligned country and GLM-4 has the best ability to align to cultural values. Deeper investigation sheds light on the influence of model origin, prompt language, and value dimensions on cultural output. Specifically, models, regardless of where they originate, align better with the US than they do with China. The conclusions provide insight to how LLMs can be better aligned to various cultures as well as provoke further discussion of the potential for LLMs to propagate cultural bias and the need for more culturally adaptable models."
2504.08954,"The emergent capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have prompted interest in using them as surrogates for human subjects in opinion surveys. However, prior evaluations of LLM-based opinion simulation have relied heavily on costly, domain-specific survey data, and mixed empirical results leave their reliability in question. To enable cost-effective, early-stage evaluation, we introduce a quality control assessment designed to test the viability of LLM-simulated opinions on Likert-scale tasks without requiring large-scale human data for validation. This assessment comprises two key tests: \emph{logical consistency} and \emph{alignment with stakeholder expectations}, offering a low-cost, domain-adaptable validation tool. We apply our quality control assessment to an opinion simulation task relevant to AI-assisted content moderation and fact-checking workflows -- a socially impactful use case -- and evaluate seven LLMs using a baseline prompt engineering method (backstory prompting), as well as fine-tuning and in-context learning variants. None of the models or methods pass the full assessment, revealing several failure modes. We conclude with a discussion of the risk management implications and release \texttt{TopicMisinfo}, a benchmark dataset with paired human and LLM annotations simulated by various models and approaches, to support future research."
2504.08972,"Integration of Machine Learning (ML) techniques into public administration marks a new and transformative era for e-government systems. While traditionally e-government studies were focusing on text-based interactions, this one explores the innovative application of ML for image analysis, an approach that enables governments to address citizen petitions more efficiently. By using image classification and object detection algorithms, the model proposed in this article supports public institutions in identifying and fast responding to evidence submitted by citizens in picture format, such as infrastructure issues, environmental concerns or other urban issues that citizens might face. The research also highlights the Jevons Paradox as a critical factor, wherein increased efficiency from the citizen side (especially using mobile platforms and apps) may generate higher demand which should lead to scalable and robust solutions. Using as a case study a Romanian municipality who provided datasets of citizen-submitted images, the author analysed and proved that ML can improve accuracy and responsiveness of public institutions. The findings suggest that adopting ML for e-petition systems can not only enhance citizen participation but also speeding up administrative processes, paving the way for more transparent and effective governance. This study contributes to the discourse on e-government 3.0 by showing the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transform public service delivery, ensuring sustainable (and scalable) solutions for the growing demands of modern urban governance."
2504.08989,"Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental task in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), which aims to model the dynamic knowledge states of students based on their interaction histories. However, existing KT models often rely on a global forgetting decay mechanism for capturing learning patterns, assuming that students' performance is predominantly influenced by their most recent interactions. Such approaches fail to account for the diverse and complex learning patterns arising from individual differences and varying learning stages. To address this limitation, we propose RouterKT, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to capture heterogeneous learning patterns by enabling experts to specialize in different patterns without any handcrafted learning pattern bias such as forgetting decay. Specifically, RouterKT introduces a \textbf{person-wise routing mechanism} to effectively model individual-specific learning behaviors and employs \textbf{multi-heads as experts} to enhance the modeling of complex and diverse patterns. Comprehensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that RouterKT exhibits significant flexibility and improves the performance of various KT backbone models, with a maximum average AUC improvement of 3.29\% across different backbones and datasets, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, RouterKT demonstrates consistently superior inference efficiency compared to existing approaches based on handcrafted learning pattern bias, highlighting its usability for real-world educational applications.

2504.0903,"This article introduces the concept of \textit{authoritarian recursion} to theorize how AI systems consolidate institutional control across education, warfare, and digital discourse. It identifies a shared recursive architecture in which algorithms mediate judgment, obscure accountability, and constrain moral and epistemic agency.Grounded in critical discourse analysis and sociotechnical ethics, the paper examines how AI systems normalize hierarchy through abstraction and feedback. Case studies -- automated proctoring, autonomous weapons, and content recommendation -- are analyzed alongside cultural imaginaries such as Orwell's \textit{Nineteen Eighty-Four}, Skynet, and \textit{Black Mirror}, used as heuristic tools to surface ethical blind spots.The analysis integrates Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT), relational ethics, and data justice to explore how predictive infrastructures enable moral outsourcing and epistemic closure. By reframing AI as a communicative and institutional infrastructure, the article calls for governance approaches that center democratic refusal, epistemic plurality, and structural accountability."
2504.09059,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way we operate our society and will undoubtedly impact power systems as well - but how exactly? By integrating various data streams - including real-time grid data, market dynamics, and consumer behaviors - LLMs have the potential to make power system operations more adaptive, enhance proactive security measures, and deliver personalized energy services. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of 30 real-world applications across eight key categories: Grid Operations and Management, Energy Markets and Trading, Personalized Energy Management and Customer Engagement, Grid Planning and Education, Grid Security and Compliance, Advanced Data Analysis and Knowledge Discovery, Emerging Applications and Societal Impact, and LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning. Critical technical hurdles, such as data privacy and model reliability, are examined, along with possible solutions. Ultimately, this review illustrates how LLMs can significantly contribute to building more resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy infrastructures, underscoring the necessity of their responsible and equitable deployment."
2504.09137,"The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping operational paradigms across multidisciplinary domains. LLMs' emergent capability to synthesize policy-relevant insights across disciplinary boundaries suggests potential as decision-support tools. However, their actual performance and suitability as policy refinement partners still require verification through rigorous and systematic evaluations. Our study employs the context-embedded generation-adaptation framework to conduct a tripartite comparison among the American GPT-4o, the Chinese DeepSeek-R1 and human researchers, investigating the capability boundaries and performance characteristics of LLMs in generating policy recommendations for China's social security issues. This study demonstrates that while LLMs exhibit distinct advantages in systematic policy design, they face significant limitations in addressing complex social dynamics, balancing stakeholder interests, and controlling fiscal risks within the social security domain. Furthermore, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates superior performance to GPT-4o across all evaluation dimensions in policy recommendation generation, illustrating the potential of localized training to improve contextual alignment. These findings suggest that regionally-adapted LLMs can function as supplementary tools for generating diverse policy alternatives informed by domain-specific social insights. Nevertheless, the formulation of policy refinement requires integration with human researchers' expertise, which remains critical for interpreting institutional frameworks, cultural norms, and value systems."
2504.09142,"Heating of buildings represents a significant share of the energy consumption in Europe. Smart thermostats that capitalize on the data-driven analysis of heating patterns in order to optimize heat supply are a very promising part of building energy management technology. However, factors driving their acceptance by building inhabitants are poorly understood although being a prerequisite for fully tapping on their potential. In order to understand the driving forces of technology adoption in this use case, a large survey (N = 2250) was conducted in five EU countries (Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Germany, Greece). For the data analysis structural equation modelling based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) was employed, which was extended by adding social beliefs, including descriptive social norms, collective efficacy, social identity and trust. As a result, performance expectancy, price value, and effort expectancy proved to be the most important predictors overall, with variations across countries. In sum, the adoption of smart thermostats appears more strongly associated with individual beliefs about their functioning, potentially reducing their adoption. At the end of the paper, implications for policy making and marketing of smart heating technologies are discussed."
2504.09779,"The widespread adoption of generative AI is already impacting learning and help-seeking. While the benefits of generative AI are well-understood, recent studies have also raised concerns about increased potential for cheating and negative impacts on students' metacognition and critical thinking. However, the potential impacts on social interactions, peer learning, and classroom dynamics are not yet well understood. To investigate these aspects, we conducted 17 semi-structured interviews with undergraduate computing students across seven R1 universities in North America. Our findings suggest that help-seeking requests are now often mediated by generative AI. For example, students often redirected questions from their peers to generative AI instead of providing assistance themselves, undermining peer interaction. Students also reported feeling increasingly isolated and demotivated as the social support systems they rely on begin to break down. These findings are concerning given the important role that social interactions play in students' learning and sense of belonging."
2504.09857,"Vaccine hesitancy and misinformation are significant barriers to achieving widespread vaccination coverage. Smaller public health departments may lack the expertise or resources to craft effective vaccine messaging. This paper explores the potential of ChatGPT-augmented messaging to promote confidence in vaccination uptake.We conducted a survey in which participants chose between pairs of vaccination messages and assessed which was more persuasive and to what extent. In each pair, one message was the original, and the other was augmented by ChatGPT. At the end of the survey, participants were informed that half of the messages had been generated by ChatGPT. They were then asked to provide both quantitative and qualitative responses regarding how knowledge of a message's ChatGPT origin affected their impressions.Overall, ChatGPT-augmented messages were rated slightly higher than the original messages. These messages generally scored better when they were longer. Respondents did not express major concerns about ChatGPT-generated content, nor was there a significant relationship between participants' views on ChatGPT and their message ratings. Notably, there was a correlation between whether a message appeared first or second in a pair and its score.These results point to the potential of ChatGPT to enhance vaccine messaging, suggesting a promising direction for future research on human-AI collaboration in public health communication."
2504.09861,"Large language models (LLMs) are transforming global decision-making and societal systems by processing diverse data at unprecedented scales. However, their potential to homogenize human values poses critical risks, similar to biodiversity loss undermining ecological resilience. Rooted in the ancient Greek concept of ethos, meaning both individual character and the shared moral fabric of communities, EthosGPT draws on a tradition that spans from Aristotle's virtue ethics to Adam Smith's moral sentiments as the ethical foundation of economic cooperation. These traditions underscore the vital role of value diversity in fostering social trust, institutional legitimacy, and long-term prosperity. EthosGPT addresses the challenge of value homogenization by introducing an open-source framework for mapping and evaluating LLMs within a global scale of human values. Using international survey data on cultural indices, prompt-based assessments, and comparative statistical analyses, EthosGPT reveals both the adaptability and biases of LLMs across regions and cultures. It offers actionable insights for developing inclusive LLMs, such as diversifying training data and preserving endangered cultural heritage to ensure representation in AI systems. These contributions align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 11.4 (Cultural Heritage Preservation), and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). Through interdisciplinary collaboration, EthosGPT promotes AI systems that are both technically robust and ethically inclusive, advancing value plurality as a cornerstone for sustainable and equitable futures."
2504.09865,"As generative artificial intelligence (AI) enables the creation and dissemination of information at massive scale and speed, it is increasingly important to understand how people perceive AI-generated content. One prominent policy proposal requires explicitly labeling AI-generated content to increase transparency and encourage critical thinking about the information, but prior research has not yet tested the effects of such labels. To address this gap, we conducted a survey experiment (N=1601) on a diverse sample of Americans, presenting participants with an AI-generated message about several public policies (e.g., allowing colleges to pay student-athletes), randomly assigning whether participants were told the message was generated by (a) an expert AI model, (b) a human policy expert, or (c) no label. We found that messages were generally persuasive, influencing participants' views of the policies by 9.74 percentage points on average. However, while 94.6% of participants assigned to the AI and human label conditions believed the authorship labels, labels had no significant effects on participants' attitude change toward the policies, judgments of message accuracy, nor intentions to share the message with others. These patterns were robust across a variety of participant characteristics, including prior knowledge of the policy, prior experience with AI, political party, education level, or age. Taken together, these results imply that, while authorship labels would likely enhance transparency, they are unlikely to substantially affect the persuasiveness of the labeled content, highlighting the need for alternative strategies to address challenges posed by AI-generated information."
2504.09946,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o1 have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, raising important questions about their biases in LLM-as-a-judge settings. We present a comprehensive benchmark comparing judging biases between LLMs and LRMs across both subjective preference-alignment datasets and objective fact-based datasets. Through investigation of bandwagon, authority, position, and distraction biases, we uncover four key findings: (1) despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, LRMs remain susceptible to the above biases; (2) LRMs demonstrate better robustness than LLMs specifically on fact-related datasets; (3) LRMs exhibit notable position bias, preferring options in later positions; and (4) we identify a novel ""superficial reflection bias"" where phrases mimicking reasoning (e.g., ""wait, let me think..."") significantly influence model judgments. To address these biases, we design and evaluate three mitigation strategies: specialized system prompts that reduce judging biases by up to 19\% in preference alignment datasets and 14\% in fact-related datasets, in-context learning that provides up to 27\% improvement on preference tasks but shows inconsistent results on factual tasks, and a self-reflection mechanism that reduces biases by up to 10\% in preference datasets and 16\% in fact-related datasets, with self-reflection proving particularly effective for LRMs. Our work provides crucial insights for developing more reliable LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, especially as LRMs become increasingly deployed as automated judges."
2504.10277,"Language model deployments in consumer-facing applications introduce numerous risks. While existing research on harms and hazards of such applications follows top-down approaches derived from regulatory frameworks and theoretical analyses, empirical evidence of real-world failure modes remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RealHarm, a dataset of annotated problematic interactions with AI agents built from a systematic review of publicly reported incidents. Analyzing harms, causes, and hazards specifically from the deployer's perspective, we find that reputational damage constitutes the predominant organizational harm, while misinformation emerges as the most common hazard category. We empirically evaluate state-of-the-art guardrails and content moderation systems to probe whether such systems would have prevented the incidents, revealing a significant gap in the protection of AI applications."
2504.1065,"The growing prevalence of conversational voice interfaces, powered by developments in both speech and language technologies, raises important questions about their influence on human communication. While written communication can signal identity through lexical and stylistic choices, voice-based interactions inherently amplify socioindexical elements - such as accent, intonation, and speech style - which more prominently convey social identity and group affiliation. There is evidence that even passive media such as television is likely to influence the audience's linguistic patterns. Unlike passive media, conversational AI is interactive, creating a more immersive and reciprocal dynamic that holds a greater potential to impact how individuals speak in everyday interactions. Such heightened influence can be expected to arise from phenomena such as acoustic-prosodic entrainment and linguistic accommodation, which occur naturally during interaction and enable users to adapt their speech patterns in response to the system. While this phenomenon is still emerging, its potential societal impact could provide organisations, movements, and brands with a subtle yet powerful avenue for shaping and controlling public perception and social identity. We argue that the socioindexical influence of AI-generated speech warrants attention and should become a focus of interdisciplinary research, leveraging new and existing methodologies and technologies to better understand its implications."
2504.10886,"Deploying large language models (LLMs) with agency in real-world applications raises critical questions about how these models will behave. In particular, how will their decisions align with humans when faced with moral dilemmas? This study examines the alignment between LLM-driven decisions and human judgment in various contexts of the moral machine experiment, including personas reflecting different sociodemographics. We find that the moral decisions of LLMs vary substantially by persona, showing greater shifts in moral decisions for critical tasks than humans. Our data also indicate an interesting partisan sorting phenomenon, where political persona predominates the direction and degree of LLM decisions. We discuss the ethical implications and risks associated with deploying these models in applications that involve moral decisions."
2504.11196,"The National Covid Memorial Wall in London, featuring over 240,000 hand-painted red hearts, faces significant conservation challenges due to the rapid fading of the paint. This study evaluates the transition to a better-quality paint and its implications for the wall's long-term preservation. The rapid fading of the initial materials required an unsustainable repainting rate, burdening volunteers. Lifetime simulations based on a collections demography framework suggest that repainting efforts must continue at a rate of some hundreds of hearts per week to maintain a stable percentage of hearts in good condition. This finding highlights the need for a sustainable management strategy that includes regular maintenance or further reduction of the fading rate.Methodologically, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using a collections demography approach, supported by citizen science and social media data, to inform heritage management decisions. An agent-based simulation is used to propagate the multiple uncertainties measured. The methodology provides a robust basis for modeling and decision-making, even in a case like this, where reliance on publicly available images and volunteer-collected data introduces variability. Future studies could improve data within a citizen science framework by inviting public submissions, using on-site calibration charts, and increasing volunteer involvement for longitudinal data collection. This research illustrates the flexibility of the collections demography framework, firstly by showing its applicability to an outdoor monument, which is very different from the published case studies, and secondly by demonstrating how it can work even with low-quality data."
2504.11341,"Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) automate governance and resource allocation through smart contracts, aiming to shift decision-making to distributed token holders. However, many DAOs face sustainability challenges linked to limited user participation, concentrated voting power, and technical design constraints. This paper addresses these issues by identifying research gaps in DAO evaluation and introducing a framework of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that capture governance efficiency, financial robustness, decentralisation, and community engagement. We apply the framework to a custom-built dataset of real-world DAOs constructed from on-chain data and analysed using non-parametric methods. The results reveal recurring governance patterns, including low participation rates and high proposer concentration, which may undermine long-term viability. The proposed KPIs offer a replicable, data-driven method for assessing DAO governance structures and identifying potential areas for improvement. These findings support a multidimensional approach to evaluating decentralised systems and provide practical tools for researchers and practitioners working to improve the resilience and effectiveness of DAO-based governance models."
2504.11481,"This study addresses the challenges of tracking and analyzing students' learning trajectories, particularly the issue of inadequate knowledge coverage in course assessments. Traditional assessment tools often fail to fully cover course content, leading to imprecise evaluations of student mastery. To tackle this problem, the study proposes a knowledge graph construction method based on large language models (LLMs), which transforms learning materials into structured data and generates personalized learning trajectory graphs by analyzing students' test data. Experimental results demonstrate that the model effectively alerts teachers to potential biases in their exam questions and tracks individual student progress. This system not only enhances the accuracy of learning assessments but also helps teachers provide timely guidance to students who are falling behind, thereby improving overall teaching strategies."
2504.11486,"Foreign information operations on social media platforms pose significant risks to democratic societies. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), this threat is likely to intensify, potentially overwhelming human defenders. To achieve the necessary scale and tempo to defend against these threats, utilizing AI as part of the solution seems inevitable. Although there has been a significant debate on AI in Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS), it is equally likely that AI will be widely used in information operations for defensive and offensive objectives. Similar to LAWS, AI-driven information operations occupy a highly sensitive moral domain where removing human involvement in the tactical decision making process raises ethical concerns. Although AI has yet to revolutionize the field, a solid ethical stance is urgently needed on how AI can be responsibly used to defend against information operations on social media platforms. This paper proposes possible AI-enabled countermeasures against cognitive warfare and argues how they can be developed in a responsible way, such that meaningful human control is preserved."
2504.11501,"This paper presents a proposal for the governance of frontier AI systems through a hybrid public-private system. Private bodies, authorized and overseen by government, provide certifications to developers of frontier AI systems on an opt-in basis. In exchange for opting in, frontier AI firms receive protections from tort liability for customer misuse of their models. Before detailing the proposal, the paper explores more commonly discussed approaches to AI governance, analyzing their strengths and flaws. It also examines the nature of frontier AI governance itself. The paper includes consideration of the political economic, institutional, legal, safety, and other merits and tradeoffs inherent in the governance system it proposes."
2504.11504,"As machine learning models are increasingly used in educational settings, from detecting at-risk students to predicting student performance, algorithmic bias and its potential impacts on students raise critical concerns about algorithmic fairness. Although group fairness is widely explored in education, works on individual fairness in a causal context are understudied, especially on counterfactual fairness. This paper explores the notion of counterfactual fairness for educational data by conducting counterfactual fairness analysis of machine learning models on benchmark educational datasets. We demonstrate that counterfactual fairness provides meaningful insight into the causality of sensitive attributes and causal-based individual fairness in education."
2504.11564,"As artificial intelligence (AI) systems rapidly gain autonomy, the need for robust responsible AI frameworks becomes paramount. This paper investigates how organizations perceive and adapt such frameworks amidst the emerging landscape of increasingly sophisticated agentic AI. Employing an interpretive qualitative approach, the study explores the lived experiences of AI professionals. Findings highlight that the inherent complexity of agentic AI systems and their responsible implementation, rooted in the intricate interconnectedness of responsible AI dimensions and the thematic framework (an analytical structure developed from the data), combined with the novelty of agentic AI, contribute to significant challenges in organizational adaptation, characterized by knowledge gaps, a limited emphasis on stakeholder engagement, and a strong focus on control. These factors, by hindering effective adaptation and implementation, ultimately compromise the potential for responsible AI and the realization of ROI."
2504.11691,"Existing estimates of human migration are limited in their scope, reliability, and timeliness, prompting the United Nations and the Global Compact on Migration to call for improved data collection. Using privacy protected records from three billion Facebook users, we estimate country-to-country migration flows at monthly granularity for 181 countries, accounting for selection into Facebook usage. Our estimates closely match high-quality measures of migration where available but can be produced nearly worldwide and with less delay than alternative methods. We estimate that 39.1 million people migrated internationally in 2022 (0.63% of the population of the countries in our sample). Migration flows significantly changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, decreasing by 64% before rebounding in 2022 to a pace 24% above the pre-crisis rate. We also find that migration from Ukraine increased tenfold in the wake of the Russian invasion. To support research and policy interventions, we will release these estimates publicly through the Humanitarian Data Exchange."
2504.11913,"In today's digital world, computing education offers critical opportunities, yet systemic inequities exclude under-represented communities, especially in rural, under-resourced regions. Early engagement is vital for building interest in computing careers and achieving equitable participation. Recent work has shown that the use of sensor-enabled tools and block-based programming can improve engagement and self-efficacy for students from under-represented groups, but these findings lack replication in diverse, resource-constrained settings. This study addresses this gap by implementing sensor-based programming workshops with rural students in Sri Lanka. Replicating methods from the literature, we conduct a between-group study (sensor vs. non-sensor) using Scratch and real-time environmental sensors. We found that students in both groups reported significantly higher confidence in programming in Scratch after the workshop. In addition, average changes in both self-efficacy and outcome expectancy were higher in the experimental (sensor) group than in the control (non-sensor) group, mirroring trends observed in the original study being replicated. We also found that using the sensors helped to enhance creativity and inspired some students to express an interest in information and communications technology (ICT) careers, supporting the value of such hands-on activities in building programming confidence among under-represented groups."
2504.11928,"Today's world is witnessing an unparalleled rate of technological transformation. The emergence of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has transformed how we handle digital assets and value. Despite their initial popularity, NFTs face declining adoption influenced not only by cryptocurrency volatility but also by trust dynamics within communities. From a social computing perspective, understanding these trust dynamics offers valuable insights for the development of both the NFT ecosystem and the broader digital economy. China presents a compelling context for examining these dynamics, offering a unique intersection of technological innovation and traditional cultural values. Through a content analysis of eight Chinese NFT-focused WeChat groups and 21 semi-structured interviews, we examine how socio-cultural factors influence trust formation and development. We found that trust in Chinese NFT communities is significantly molded by local cultural values. To be precise, Confucian virtues, such as benevolence, propriety, and integrity, play a crucial role in shaping these trust relationships. Our research identifies three critical trust dimensions in China's NFT market: (1) technological, (2) institutional, and (3) social. We examined the challenges in cultivating each dimension. Based on these insights, we developed tailored trust-building guidelines for Chinese NFT stakeholders. These guidelines address trust issues that factor into NFT's declining popularity and could offer valuable strategies for CSCW researchers, developers, and designers aiming to enhance trust in global NFT communities. Our research urges CSCW scholars to take into account the unique socio-cultural contexts when developing trust-enhancing strategies for digital innovations and online interactions."
2504.1217,"The most advanced future AI systems will first be deployed inside the frontier AI companies developing them. According to these companies and independent experts, AI systems may reach or even surpass human intelligence and capabilities by 2030. Internal deployment is, therefore, a key source of benefits and risks from frontier AI systems. Despite this, the governance of the internal deployment of highly advanced frontier AI systems appears absent. This report aims to address this absence by priming a conversation around the governance of internal deployment. It presents a conceptualization of internal deployment, learnings from other sectors, reviews of existing legal frameworks and their applicability, and illustrative examples of the type of scenarios we are most concerned about. Specifically, it discusses the risks correlated to the loss of control via the internal application of a misaligned AI system to the AI research and development pipeline, and unconstrained and undetected power concentration behind closed doors. The report culminates with a small number of targeted recommendations that provide a first blueprint for the governance of internal deployment."
2504.12309,"From 2000 to 2015, the UN's Millennium Development Goals guided global priorities. The subsequent Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted a more dynamic approach, with annual indicator updates. As 2030 nears and progress lags, innovative acceleration strategies are critical. This study develops an AI-powered knowledge graph system to analyze SDG interconnections, discover potential new goals, and visualize them online. Using official SDG texts, Elsevier's keyword dataset, and 1,127 TED Talk transcripts (2020.01-2024.04), a pilot on 269 talks from 2023 applies AI-speculative design, large language models, and retrieval-augmented generation. Key findings include: (1) Heatmap analysis reveals strong associations between Goal 10 and Goal 16, and minimal coverage of Goal 6. (2) In the knowledge graph, simulated dialogue over time reveals new central nodes, showing how richer data supports divergent thinking and goal clarity. (3) Six potential new goals are proposed, centered on equity, resilience, and technology-driven inclusion. This speculative-AI framework offers fresh insights for policymakers and lays groundwork for future multimodal and cross-system SDG applications."
2504.12358,"AI models are rapidly becoming embedded in all aspects of nuclear energy research and work but the safety, security, and safeguards consequences of this embedding are not well understood. In this paper, we call for the creation of an anticipatory system of governance for AI in the nuclear sector as well as the creation of a global AI observatory as a means for operationalizing anticipatory governance. The paper explores the contours of the nuclear AI observatory and an anticipatory system of governance by drawing on work in science and technology studies, public policy, and foresight studies."
2504.12476,"Recent advances in generative Artificial Intelligence have raised public awareness, shaping expectations and concerns about their societal implications. Central to these debates is the question of AI alignment -- how well AI systems meet public expectations regarding safety, fairness, and social values. However, little is known about what people expect from AI-enabled systems and how these expectations differ across national contexts. We present evidence from two surveys of public preferences for key functional features of AI-enabled systems in Germany (n = 1800) and the United States (n = 1756). We examine support for four types of alignment in AI moderation: accuracy and reliability, safety, bias mitigation, and the promotion of aspirational imaginaries. U.S. respondents report significantly higher AI use and consistently greater support for all alignment features, reflecting broader technological openness and higher societal involvement with AI. In both countries, accuracy and safety enjoy the strongest support, while more normatively charged goals -- like fairness and aspirational imaginaries -- receive more cautious backing, particularly in Germany. We also explore how individual experience with AI, attitudes toward free speech, political ideology, partisan affiliation, and gender shape these preferences. AI use and free speech support explain more variation in Germany. In contrast, U.S. responses show greater attitudinal uniformity, suggesting that higher exposure to AI may consolidate public expectations. These findings contribute to debates on AI governance and cross-national variation in public preferences. More broadly, our study demonstrates the value of empirically grounding AI alignment debates in public attitudes and of explicitly developing normatively grounded expectations into theoretical and policy discussions on the governance of AI-generated content."
2504.12498,"Social media bots are AI agents that participate in online conversations. Most studies focus on the general bot and the malicious nature of these agents. However, bots have many different personas, each specialized towards a specific behavioral or content trait. Neither are bots singularly bad, because they are used for both good and bad information dissemination. In this article, we introduce fifteen agent personas of social media bots. These personas have two main categories: Content-Based Bot Persona and Behavior-Based Bot Persona. We also form yardsticks of the good-bad duality of the bots, elaborating on metrics of good and bad bot agents. Our work puts forth a guideline to inform bot detection regulation, emphasizing that policies should focus on how these agents are employed, rather than collectively terming bot agents as bad."
2504.12536,"Educators regularly use unsanctioned technologies (apps not formally approved by their institutions) for teaching, grading, and other academic tasks. While these tools often support instructional needs, they raise significant privacy, security, and regulatory compliance concerns. Despite its importance, understanding the adoptions and risks from the perspective of educators, who serve as de facto decision makers behind unsanctioned technology use, is largely understudied in existingthis http URLaddress this gap, we conducted two surveys: one with 375 educators who listed 1,373 unsanctioned apps, and another with 21 administrators who either often help educators to set up educational technologies (EdTechs) or observe their security or privacy incidents. Our study identified 494 unique applications used by educators, primarily for pedagogical utility (n=213) and functional convenience (n=155), and the associated risks were often ignored. In fact, despite security and privacy concerns, many educators continued using the same apps (n = 62), citing a lack of alternatives or heavy dependence as barriers to discontinuation. We also found that fewer than a third of educators were aware of any institutional policy on unsanctioned technology use (K12: 30.3%, HEI: 24.8%), and 22 knowingly violated such policies. While 107 received formal warnings, only 33 adjusted their behavior. Finally, we conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and future recommendations to minimize the risks."
2504.12537,"This systematic literature review seeks to explain the mechanisms and implications of information disorder for public policy and the democratic process, by proposing a five-stage framework capturing its full life cycle. To our knowledge, no prior reviews in the field of public administration have offered a comprehensive, integrated model of information disorder; most existing studies are situated within communication, information science, or data science, and tend to focus on isolated aspects of the phenomenon. By connecting concepts and stages with enabling factors, agents, tactics and impacts, we reframe information disorder not as a question of ""truthiness"", individual cognition, digital literacy, or merely of technology, but as a socio-material phenomenon, deeply embedded in and shaped by the material conditions of contemporary digital society. This approach calls for a shift away from fragmented interventions toward more holistic, system-level policy responses."
2504.12545,"Mass-shooting events pose a significant challenge to public safety, generating large volumes of unstructured textual data that hinder effective investigations and the formulation of public policy. Despite the urgency, few prior studies have effectively automated the extraction of key information from these events to support legal and investigative efforts. This paper presented the first dataset designed for knowledge acquisition on mass-shooting events through the application of named entity recognition (NER) techniques. It focuses on identifying key entities such as offenders, victims, locations, and criminal instruments, that are vital for legal and investigative purposes. The NER process is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) using few-shot prompting, facilitating the efficient extraction and organization of critical information from diverse sources, including news articles, police reports, and social media. Experimental results on real-world mass-shooting corpora demonstrate that GPT-4o is the most effective model for mass-shooting NER, achieving the highest Micro Precision, Micro Recall, and Micro F1-scores. Meanwhile, o1-mini delivers competitive performance, making it a resource-efficient alternative for less complex NER tasks. It is also observed that increasing the shot count enhances the performance of all models, but the gains are more substantial for GPT-4o and o1-mini, highlighting their superior adaptability to few-shot learning scenarios."
2504.12914,"International cooperation is common in AI research, including between geopolitical rivals. While many experts advocate for greater international cooperation on AI safety to address shared global risks, some view cooperation on AI with suspicion, arguing that it can pose unacceptable risks to national security. However, the extent to which cooperation on AI safety poses such risks, as well as provides benefits, depends on the specific area of cooperation. In this paper, we consider technical factors that impact the risks of international cooperation on AI safety research, focusing on the degree to which such cooperation can advance dangerous capabilities, result in the sharing of sensitive information, or provide opportunities for harm. We begin by why nations historically cooperate on strategic technologies and analyse current US-China cooperation in AI as a case study. We further argue that existing frameworks for managing associated risks can be supplemented with consideration of key risks specific to cooperation on technical AI safety research. Through our analysis, we find that research into AI verification mechanisms and shared protocols may be suitable areas for such cooperation. Through this analysis we aim to help researchers and governments identify and mitigate the risks of international cooperation on AI safety research, so that the benefits of cooperation can be fully realised."
2504.13038,"The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 caused a flurry of activity and concern in the academic and educational communities. Some see the tool's ability to generate human-like text that passes at least cursory inspections for factual accuracy ``often enough'' a golden age of information retrieval and computer-assisted learning. Some, on the other hand, worry the tool may lead to unprecedented levels of academic dishonesty and cheating. In this work, we quantify some of the effects of the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) on online education by analyzing a multi-year dataset of student essay responses from a free university-level MOOC on AI ethics. Our dataset includes essays submitted both before and after ChatGPT's release. We find that the launch of ChatGPT coincided with significant changes in both the length and style of student essays, mirroring observations in other contexts such as academic publishing. We also observe -- as expected based on related public discourse -- changes in prevalence of key content words related to AI and LLMs, but not necessarily the general themes or topics discussed in the student essays as identified through (dynamic) topic modeling."
2504.13085,"Eradicating poverty is the first goal in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, aporophobia -- the societal bias against people living in poverty -- constitutes a major obstacle to designing, approving and implementing poverty-mitigation policies. This work presents an initial step towards operationalizing the concept of aporophobia to identify and track harmful beliefs and discriminative actions against poor people on social media. In close collaboration with non-profits and governmental organizations, we conduct data collection and exploration. Then we manually annotate a corpus of English tweets from five world regions for the presence of (1) direct expressions of aporophobia, and (2) statements referring to or criticizing aporophobic views or actions of others, to comprehensively characterize the social media discourse related to bias and discrimination against the poor. Based on the annotated data, we devise a taxonomy of categories of aporophobic attitudes and actions expressed through speech on social media. Finally, we train several classifiers and identify the main challenges for automatic detection of aporophobia in social networks. This work paves the way towards identifying, tracking, and mitigating aporophobic views on social media at scale."
2504.13495,"This systematic review discusses the methodological approaches and statistical confirmations of cross-cultural adaptations of cognitive evaluation tools used with different populations. The review considers six seminal studies on the methodology of cultural adaptation in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. The results indicate that proper adaptations need holistic models with demographic changes, and education explained as much as 26.76% of the variance in MoCA-H scores. Cultural-linguistic factors explained 6.89% of the variance in European adaptations of MoCA-H; however, another study on adapted MMSE and BCSB among Brazilian Indigenous populations reported excellent diagnostic performance, with a sensitivity of 94.4% and specificity of 99.2%. There was 78.5% inter-rater agreement on the evaluation of cultural adaptation using the Manchester Translation Evaluation Checklist. A paramount message of the paper is that community feedback is necessary for culturally appropriate preparation, standardized translation protocols also must be included, along with robust statistical validation methodologies for developing cognitive assessment instruments. This review supplies evidence-based frameworks for the further adaptation of cognitive assessments in increasingly diverse global health settings."
2504.1379,"The AI ethics of statistical fairness is an error, the approach should be abandoned, and the accumulated academic work deleted. The argument proceeds by identifying four recurring mistakes within statistical fairness. One conflates fairness with equality, which confines thinking to similars being treated similarly. The second and third errors derive from a perspectival ethical view which functions by negating others and their viewpoints. The final mistake constrains fairness to work within predefined social groups instead of allowing unconstrained fairness to subsequently define group composition. From the nature of these misconceptions, the larger argument follows. Because the errors are integral to how statistical fairness works, attempting to resolve the difficulties only deepens them. Consequently, the errors cannot be corrected without undermining the larger project, and statistical fairness collapses from within. While the collapse ends a failure in ethics, it also provokes distinct possibilities for fairness, data, and algorithms. Quickly indicating some of these directions is a secondary aim of the paper, and one that aligns with what fairness has consistently meant and done since Aristotle."
2504.13839,"AI governance frameworks increasingly rely on audits, yet the results of their underlying evaluations require interpretation and context to be meaningfully informative. Even technically rigorous evaluations can offer little useful insight if reported selectively or obscurely. Current literature focuses primarily on technical best practices, but evaluations are an inherently sociotechnical process, and there is little guidance on reporting procedures and context. Through literature review, stakeholder interviews, and analysis of governance frameworks, we propose ""audit cards"" to make this context explicit. We identify six key types of contextual features to report and justify in audit cards: auditor identity, evaluation scope, methodology, resource access, process integrity, and review mechanisms. Through analysis of existing evaluation reports, we find significant variation in reporting practices, with most reports omitting crucial contextual information such as auditors' backgrounds, conflicts of interest, and the level and type of access to models. We also find that most existing regulations and frameworks lack guidance on rigorous reporting. In response to these shortcomings, we argue that audit cards can provide a structured format for reporting key claims alongside their justifications, enhancing transparency, facilitating proper interpretation, and establishing trust in reporting."
2504.13947,"In this paper, we introduce a speculative design methodology for studying the behavior of generative AI systems, framing design as a mode of inquiry. We propose bridging seemingly unrelated domains to generate intentional context voids, using these tasks as probes to elicit AI model behavior. We demonstrate this through a case study: probing the ChatGPT system (GPT-4 and DALL-E) to generate headshots from professional Curricula Vitae (CVs). In contrast to traditional ways, our approach assesses system behavior under conditions of radical uncertainty -- when forced to invent entire swaths of missing context -- revealing subtle stereotypes and value-laden assumptions. We qualitatively analyze how the system interprets identity and competence markers from CVs, translating them into visual portraits despite the missing context (i.e. physical descriptors). We show that within this context void, the AI system generates biased representations, potentially relying on stereotypical associations or blatant hallucinations."
2504.13955,"The advancement of AI systems for mental health support is hindered by limited access to therapeutic conversation data, particularly for trauma treatment. We present Thousand Voices of Trauma, a synthetic benchmark dataset of 3,000 therapy conversations based on Prolonged Exposure therapy protocols for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The dataset comprises 500 unique cases, each explored through six conversational perspectives that mirror the progression of therapy from initial anxiety to peak distress to emotional processing. We incorporated diverse demographic profiles (ages 18-80, M=49.3, 49.4% male, 44.4% female, 6.2% non-binary), 20 trauma types, and 10 trauma-related behaviors using deterministic and probabilistic generation methods. Analysis reveals realistic distributions of trauma types (witnessing violence 10.6%, bullying 10.2%) and symptoms (nightmares 23.4%, substance abuse 20.8%). Clinical experts validated the dataset's therapeutic fidelity, highlighting its emotional depth while suggesting refinements for greater authenticity. We also developed an emotional trajectory benchmark with standardized metrics for evaluating model responses. This privacy-preserving dataset addresses critical gaps in trauma-focused mental health data, offering a valuable resource for advancing both patient-facing applications and clinician training tools."
2504.13957,"Language is not neutral; it frames understanding, structures power, and shapes governance. This paper argues that misnomers like cybersecurity and artificial intelligence (AI) are more than semantic quirks; they carry significant governance risks by obscuring human agency, inflating expectations, and distorting accountability. Drawing on lessons from cybersecurity's linguistic pitfalls, such as the 'weakest link' narrative, this paper highlights how AI discourse is falling into similar traps with metaphors like 'alignment,' 'black box,' and 'hallucination.' These terms embed adversarial, mystifying, or overly technical assumptions into governance structures. In response, the paper advocates for a language-first approach to AI governance: one that interrogates dominant metaphors, foregrounds human roles, and co-develops a lexicon that is precise, inclusive, and reflexive. This paper contends that linguistic reform is not peripheral to governance but central to the construction of transparent, equitable, and anticipatory regulatory frameworks."
2504.13959,"Current efforts in AI safety prioritize filtering harmful content, preventing manipulation of human behavior, and eliminating existential risks in cybersecurity or biosecurity. While pressing, this narrow focus overlooks critical human-centric considerations that shape the long-term trajectory of a society. In this position paper, we identify the risks of overlooking the impact of AI on the future of work and recommend comprehensive transition support towards the evolution of meaningful labor with human agency. Through the lens of economic theories, we highlight the intertemporal impacts of AI on human livelihood and the structural changes in labor markets that exacerbate income inequality. Additionally, the closed-source approach of major stakeholders in AI development resembles rent-seeking behavior through exploiting resources, breeding mediocrity in creative labor, and monopolizing innovation. To address this, we argue in favor of a robust international copyright anatomy supported by implementing collective licensing that ensures fair compensation mechanisms for using data to train AI models. We strongly recommend a pro-worker framework of global AI governance to enhance shared prosperity and economic justice while reducing technical debt."
2504.13962,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key indicator of soil health, fertility, and carbon sequestration, making it essential for sustainable land management and climate change mitigation. However, large-scale SOC monitoring remains challenging due to spatial variability, temporal dynamics, and multiple influencing factors. We present WALGREEN, a platform that enhances SOC inference by overcoming limitations of current applications. Leveraging machine learning and diverse soil samples, WALGREEN generates predictive models using historical public and private data. Built on cloud-based technologies, it offers a user-friendly interface for researchers, policymakers, and land managers to access carbon data, analyze trends, and support evidence-based decision-making. Implemented in Python, Java, and JavaScript, WALGREEN integrates Google Earth Engine and Sentinel Copernicus via scripting, OpenLayers, and Thymeleaf in a Model-View-Controller framework. This paper aims to advance soil science, promote sustainable agriculture, and drive critical ecosystem responses to climate change."
2504.13971,"Based on recent trends in artificial intelligence and IoT research. The cooperative potential of integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) and Multimodal Language Models (MLLMs) is presented in this survey paper for future 6G systems. It focuses on the applications of this integration in different fields, such as healthcare, agriculture, and smart cities, and investigates the four pillars of IoT integration, such as sensors, communication, processing, and security. The paper provides a comprehensive description of IoT and MLLM technologies and applications, addresses the role of multimodality in each pillar, and concludes with an overview of the most significant challenges and directions for future research. The general survey is a roadmap for researchers interested in tracing the application areas of MLLMs and IoT, highlighting the potential and challenges in this rapidly growing field. The survey recognizes the need to deal with data availability, computational expense, privacy, and real-time processing to harness the complete potential of IoT, MLLM, and 6G technology"
2504.13972,"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is central in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and expectations. However, the process remains susceptible to governance challenges, including evaluator bias, inconsistency, and the unreliability of feedback. This study examines how the cognitive capacity of evaluators, specifically their level of rationality, affects the stability of reinforcement signals. A controlled experiment comparing high-rationality and low-rationality participants reveals that evaluators with higher rationality scores produce significantly more consistent and expert-aligned feedback. In contrast, lower-rationality participants demonstrate considerable variability in their reinforcement decisions ($p < 0.01$). To address these challenges and improve RLHF governance, we recommend implementing evaluator pre-screening, systematic auditing of feedback consistency, and reliability-weighted reinforcement aggregation. These measures enhance the fairness, transparency, and robustness of AI alignment pipelines."
2504.13976,"The gas station of the future is poised to transform from a simple fuel dispensing center into an intelligent retail hub, driven by advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper explores how technology is reshaping the retail downstream sector while briefly addressing the upstream and midstream segments. By leveraging AI/ML for predictive analytics, dynamic pricing, personalized customer engagement, and IoT for real-time monitoring and automation, the future gas station will redefine the fuel retail experience. Additionally, this paper incorporates statistics, AI/ML core technical concepts, mathematical formulations, case studies, and a proposed framework for a fully autonomous gas station."
2504.13979,"Responsible Artificial Intelligence (RAI) is a combination of ethics associated with the usage of artificial intelligence aligned with the common and standard frameworks. This survey paper extensively discusses the global and national standards, applications of RAI, current technology and ongoing projects using RAI, and possible challenges in implementing and designing RAI in the industries and projects based on AI. Currently, ethical standards and implementation of RAI are decoupled which caters each industry to follow their own standards to use AI ethically. Many global firms and government organizations are taking necessary initiatives to design a common and standard framework. Social pressure and unethical way of using AI forces the RAI design rather than implementation."
2504.14053,"This research examines whether Airbnb guests' positive and negative comments influence acceptance rates and rental prices across six U.S. regions: Rhode Island, Broward County, Chicago, Dallas, San Diego, and Boston. Thousands of reviews were collected and analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify sentiments as positive or negative, followed by statistical testing (t-tests and basic correlations) on the average scores. The findings reveal that over 90 percent of reviews in each region are positive, indicating that having additional reviews does not significantly enhance prices. However, listings with predominantly positive feedback exhibit slightly higher acceptance rates, suggesting that sentiment polarity, rather than the sheer volume of reviews, is a more critical factor for host success. Additionally, budget listings often gather extensive reviews while maintaining competitive pricing, whereas premium listings sustain higher prices with fewer but highly positive reviews. These results underscore the importance of sentiment quality over quantity in shaping guest behavior and pricing strategies in an overwhelmingly positive review environment."
2504.14097,"A scalable and reliable system is required to analyze the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data efficiently to understand hospital utilization risk factors. This study aims to investigate the integration of continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) practices in data science workflows, specifically focusing on analyzing NHANES data to identify the prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. An end-to-end cloud-based DevOps framework is proposed for data analysis which examines risk factors associated with hospital utilization and evaluates key hospital utilization metrics. We have also highlighted the modular structure of the framework that can be generalized for any other domains beyond healthcare. In the framework, an online data update method is provided which can be extended further using both real and synthetic data. As such, the framework can be especially useful for sparse dataset domains such as environmental science, robotics, cybersecurity, and cultural heritage and arts."
2504.1412,"Early childhood classrooms are becoming increasingly diverse, with students spanning a range of linguistic backgrounds and abilities. AI offers innovative tools to help educators create more inclusive learning environments by breaking down language barriers and providing tailored support for children with special needs. This chapter provides a comprehensive review of how AI technologies can facilitate inclusion in early education. It is discussed AI-driven language assistance tools that enable real-time translation and communication in multilingual classrooms, and it is explored assistive technologies powered by AI that personalize learning for students with disabilities. The implications of these technologies for teachers are examined, including shifts in educator roles and workloads. General outcomes observed with AI integration - such as improved student engagement and performance - as well as challenges related to equitable access and the need for ethical implementation are highlighted. Finally, practical recommendations for educators, policymakers, and developers are offered to collaboratively harness AI in a responsible manner, ensuring that its benefits reach all learners."
2504.14324,"Climate change education often struggles to bridge the perception gap between everyday actions and their long-term environmental consequences. In response, we developed Meltdown, an immersive virtual reality (VR) escape room that simulates a grocery shopping and food waste management experience to educate university students in Singapore about sustainable consumption. The game emphasizes sustainable food choices and disposal practices, combining interactive elements and narrative feedback to promote behavioral change. Through a user study with 36 university students, we observed statistically significant improvements in participants objective knowledge, perceived confidence, and intention to adopt sustainable behaviors. Our results suggest that experiential VR environments can enhance climate education by making abstract environmental concepts more immediate and personally relevant."
2504.14531,"The growing reliance on remote work and digital collaboration has made virtual teamwork competencies essential for professional and academic success. However, the evaluation of such competencies remains a significant challenge. Existing assessment methods, predominantly based on self-reports and peer evaluations, often focus on short-term results or subjective perceptions rather than systematically examining observable teamwork behaviors. These limitations hinder the identification of specific areas for improvement and fail to support meaningful progress in skill development. Informed by group dynamic theory, this study developed a behavior-oriented framework for assessing virtual teamwork competencies among engineering students. Using focus group interviews combined with the Critical Incident Technique, the study identified three key dimensions - Group Task Dimension, Individual Task Dimension and Social Dimension - along with their behavioral indicators and student-perceived relationships between these components. The resulting framework provides a foundation for more effective assessment practices and supports the development of virtual teamwork competency essential for success in increasingly digital and globalized professional environments."
2504.14936,"With the astounding progress in (generative) artificial intelligence (AI), there has been significant public discourse regarding regulation and ethics of the technology. Is it sufficient when humans discuss this with other humans? Or, given that AI is increasingly becoming a viable source of inspiration for people (and let alone the hypothetical possibility that the technology may at some point become ""artificial general intelligence"" and/or develop consciousness), should AI not join the discourse? There are new questions and angles that AI brings to the table that we might not have considered before - so let us make the key subject of this book an active participant. This chapter therefore includes a brief human-AI conversation on the topic of AI rights and ethics."
2504.15088,"Risk thresholds provide a measure of the level of risk exposure that a society or individual is willing to withstand, ultimately shaping how we determine the safety of technological systems. Against the backdrop of the Cold War, the first risk analyses, such as those devised for nuclear systems, cemented societally accepted risk thresholds against which safety-critical and defense systems are now evaluated. But today, the appropriate risk tolerances for AI systems have yet to be agreed on by global governing efforts, despite the need for democratic deliberation regarding the acceptable levels of harm to human life. Absent such AI risk thresholds, AI technologists-primarily industry labs, as well as ""AI safety"" focused organizations-have instead advocated for risk tolerances skewed by a purported AI arms race and speculative ""existential"" risks, taking over the arbitration of risk determinations with life-or-death consequences, subverting democratic processes.In this paper, we demonstrate how such approaches have allowed AI technologists to engage in ""safety revisionism,"" substituting traditional safety methods and terminology with ill-defined alternatives that vie for the accelerated adoption of military AI uses at the cost of lowered safety and security thresholds. We explore how the current trajectory for AI risk determination and evaluation for foundation model use within national security is poised for a race to the bottom, to the detriment of the US's national security interests. Safety-critical and defense systems must comply with assurance frameworks that are aligned with established risk thresholds, and foundation models are no exception. As such, development of evaluation frameworks for AI-based military systems must preserve the safety and security of US critical and defense infrastructure, and remain in alignment with international humanitarian law."
2504.15181,"This report provides a detailed comparison between the Safety and Security measures proposed in the EU AI Act's General-Purpose AI (GPAI) Code of Practice (Third Draft) and the current commitments and practices voluntarily adopted by leading AI companies. As the EU moves toward enforcing binding obligations for GPAI model providers, the Code of Practice will be key for bridging legal requirements with concrete technical commitments. Our analysis focuses on the draft's Safety and Security section (Commitments II.1-II.16), documenting excerpts from current public-facing documents that are relevant to each individual measure.We systematically reviewed different document types, such as companies' frontier safety frameworks and model cards, from over a dozen companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and others. This report is not meant to be an indication of legal compliance, nor does it take any prescriptive viewpoint about the Code of Practice or companies' policies. Instead, it aims to inform the ongoing dialogue between regulators and General-Purpose AI model providers by surfacing evidence of industry precedent for various measures. Nonetheless, we were able to find relevant quotes from at least 5 companies' documents for the majority of the measures in Commitments II.1-II.16."
2504.15333,"Special interest groups (SIGs) in the U.S. participate in a range of political activities, such as lobbying and making campaign donations, to influence policy decisions in the legislative and executive branches. The competing interests of these SIGs have profound implications for global issues such as international trade policies, immigration, climate change, and global health challenges. Despite the significance of understanding SIGs' policy positions, empirical challenges in observing them have often led researchers to rely on indirect measurements or focus on a select few SIGs that publicly support or oppose a limited range of legislation. This study introduces the first large-scale effort to directly measure and predict a wide range of bill positions-Support, Oppose, Engage (Amend and Monitor)- across all legislative bills introduced from the 111th to the 117th Congresses. We leverage an advanced AI framework, including large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), to develop a scalable pipeline that automatically extracts these positions from lobbying activities, resulting in a dataset of 42k bills annotated with 279k bill positions of 12k SIGs. With this large-scale dataset, we reveal (i) a strong correlation between a bill's progression through legislative process stages and the positions taken by interest groups, (ii) a significant relationship between firm size and lobbying positions, (iii) notable distinctions in lobbying position distribution based on bill subject, and (iv) heterogeneity in the distribution of policy preferences across industries. We introduce a novel framework for examining lobbying strategies and offer opportunities to explore how interest groups shape the political landscape."
2504.15416,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly, with the potential for significantly automating AI research and development itself in the near future. In 2024, international scientists, including Turing Award recipients, warned of risks from autonomous AI research and development (R&D), suggesting a red line such that no AI system should be able to improve itself or other AI systems without explicit human approval and assistance. However, the criteria for meaningful human approval remain unclear, and there is limited analysis on the specific risks of autonomous AI R&D, how they arise, and how to mitigate them. In this brief paper, we outline how these risks may emerge and propose four minimum safeguard recommendations applicable when AI agents significantly automate or accelerate AI development."
2504.1544,"This paper documents three stylized facts about the demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) using data from OpenRouter, a prominent LLM marketplace. First, new models experience rapid initial adoption that stabilizes within weeks. Second, model releases differ substantially in whether they primarily attract new users or substitute demand from competing models. Third, multihoming, using multiple models simultaneously, is common among apps. These findings suggest significant horizontal and vertical differentiation in the LLM market, implying opportunities for providers to maintain demand and pricing power despite rapid technological advances."
2504.15469,"As artificial intelligence systems increasingly permeate processes of cultural and epistemic production, there are growing concerns about how their outputs may confine individuals and groups to static or restricted narratives about who or what they could be. In this paper, we advance the discourse surrounding these concerns by making three contributions. First, we introduce the concept of aspirational affordance to describe how culturally shared interpretive resources can shape individual cognition, and in particular exercises practical imagination. We show how this concept can ground productive evaluations of the risks of AI-enabled representations and narratives. Second, we provide three reasons for scrutinizing of AI's influence on aspirational affordances: AI's influence is potentially more potent, but less public than traditional sources; AI's influence is not simply incremental, but ecological, transforming the entire landscape of cultural and epistemic practices that traditionally shaped aspirational affordances; and AI's influence is highly concentrated, with a few corporate-controlled systems mediating a growing portion of aspirational possibilities. Third, to advance such a scrutiny, we introduce the concept of aspirational harm, which, in the context of AI systems, arises when AI-enabled aspirational affordances distort or diminish available interpretive resources in ways that undermine individuals' ability to imagine relevant practical possibilities and alternative futures. Through three case studies, we illustrate how aspirational harms extend the existing discourse on AI-inflicted harms beyond representational and allocative harms, warranting separate attention. Through these conceptual resources and analyses, this paper advances understanding of the psychological and societal stakes of AI's role in shaping individual and collective aspirations."
2504.1569,"In an increasingly data-driven world, the ability to understand, interpret, and use data - data literacy - is emerging as a critical competence across all academic disciplines. The Data Literacy Initiative (DaLI) at TH Köln addresses this need by developing a comprehensive competence model for promoting data literacy in higher education. Based on interdisciplinary collaboration and empirical research, the DaLI model defines seven overarching competence areas: ""Establish Data Culture"", ""Provide Data"", ""Manage Data"", ""Analyze Data"", ""Evaluate Data"", ""Interpret Data"", and ""Publish Data"". Each area is further detailed by specific competence dimensions and progression levels, providing a structured framework for curriculum design, teaching, and assessment. Intended for use across disciplines, the model supports the strategic integration of data literacy into university programs. By providing a common language and orientation for educators and institutions, the DaLI model contributes to the broader goal of preparing students to navigate and shape a data-informed society."
2504.16026,"Frontier AI development relies on powerful AI supercomputers, yet analysis of these systems is limited. We create a dataset of 500 AI supercomputers from 2019 to 2025 and analyze key trends in performance, power needs, hardware cost, ownership, and global distribution. We find that the computational performance of AI supercomputers has doubled every nine months, while hardware acquisition cost and power needs both doubled every year. The leading system in March 2025, xAI's Colossus, used 200,000 AI chips, had a hardware cost of \$7B, and required 300 MW of power, as much as 250,000 households. As AI supercomputers evolved from tools for science to industrial machines, companies rapidly expanded their share of total AI supercomputer performance, while the share of governments and academia diminished. Globally, the United States accounts for about 75% of total performance in our dataset, with China in second place at 15%. If the observed trends continue, the leading AI supercomputer in 2030 will achieve $2\times10^{22}$ 16-bit FLOP/s, use two million AI chips, have a hardware cost of \$200 billion, and require 9 GW of power. Our analysis provides visibility into the AI supercomputer landscape, allowing policymakers to assess key AI trends like resource needs, ownership, and national competitiveness."
2504.1609,"Backgrounds: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, yet translating AI models from theoretical frameworks to real-world clinical applications remains challenging. The Mayo Clinic Platform (MCP) was established to address these challenges by providing a scalable ecosystem that integrates real-world multiple modalities data from multiple institutions, advanced analytical tools, and secure computing environments to support clinical research and AI development. Methods: In this study, we conducted four research projects leveraging MCP's data infrastructure and analytical capabilities to demonstrate its potential in facilitating real-world evidence generation and AI-driven clinical insights. Utilizing MCP's tools and environment, we facilitated efficient cohort identification, data extraction, and subsequent statistical or AI-powered analyses. Results: The results underscore MCP's role in accelerating translational research by offering de-identified, standardized real-world data and facilitating AI model validation across diverse healthcare settings. Compared to Mayo's internal Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, MCP provides broader accessibility, enhanced data standardization, and multi-institutional integration, making it a valuable resource for both internal and external researchers. Conclusion: Looking ahead, MCP is well-positioned to transform clinical research through its scalable ecosystem, effectively bridging the divide between AI innovation and clinical deployment. Future investigations will build upon this foundation, further exploring MCP's capacity to advance precision medicine and enhance patient outcomes."
2504.16092,"Cooperative speech is purposive. From the speaker's perspective, one crucial purpose is the transmission of knowledge. Cooperative speakers care about getting things right for their conversational partners. This attitude is a kind of respect. Cooperative speech is an ideal form of communication because participants have respect for each other. And having respect within a cooperative enterprise is sufficient for a particular kind of moral standing: we ought to respect those who have respect for us. Respect demands reciprocity. I maintain that large language models aren't owed the kind of respect that partly constitutes a cooperative conversation. This implies that they aren't cooperative interlocutors, otherwise we would be obliged to reciprocate the attitude. Leveraging this conclusion, I argue that present-day LLMs are incapable of assertion and that this raises an overlooked doubt about their semantic competence. One upshot of this argument is that knowledge of meaning isn't just a subject for the cognitive psychologist. It's also a subject for the moral psychologist."
2504.16104,"Physical attractiveness matters. It has been shown to influence human perception and decision-making, often leading to biased judgments that favor those deemed attractive in what is referred to as the ""attractiveness halo effect"". While extensively studied in human judgments in a broad set of domains, including hiring, judicial sentencing or credit granting, the role that attractiveness plays in the assessments and decisions made by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is unknown. To address this gap, we conduct an empirical study with 7 diverse open-source MLLMs evaluated on 91 socially relevant scenarios and a diverse dataset of 924 face images - corresponding to 462 individuals both with and without beauty filters applied to them. Our analysis reveals that attractiveness impacts the decisions made by MLLMs in 86.2% of the scenarios on average, demonstrating substantial bias in model behavior in what we refer to as an attractiveness bias. Similarly to humans, we find empirical evidence of the existence of the attractiveness halo effect in 94.8% of the relevant scenarios: attractive individuals are more likely to be attributed positive traits, such as intelligence or confidence, by MLLMs than unattractive individuals. Furthermore, we uncover gender, age and race biases in a significant portion of the scenarios which are also impacted by attractiveness, particularly in the case of gender, highlighting the intersectional nature of the algorithmic attractiveness bias. Our findings suggest that societal stereotypes and cultural norms intersect with perceptions of attractiveness in MLLMs in a complex manner. Our work emphasizes the need to account for intersectionality in algorithmic bias detection and mitigation efforts and underscores the challenges of addressing biases in modern MLLMs."
2504.16122,"Social simulation through large language model (LLM) agents is a promising approach to explore and validate hypotheses related to social science questions and LLM agents behavior. We present SOTOPIA-S4, a fast, flexible, and scalable social simulation system that addresses the technical barriers of current frameworks while enabling practitioners to generate multi-turn and multi-party LLM-based interactions with customizable evaluation metrics for hypothesis testing. SOTOPIA-S4 comes as a pip package that contains a simulation engine, an API server with flexible RESTful APIs for simulation management, and a web interface that enables both technical and non-technical users to design, run, and analyze simulations without programming. We demonstrate the usefulness of SOTOPIA-S4 with two use cases involving dyadic hiring negotiation and multi-party planning scenarios."
2504.16132,"Tutoring is highly effective for promoting learning. However, the contribution of expertise to tutoring effectiveness is unclear and continues to be debated. We conducted a 9-week learning efficacy study of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) for biology modeled on expert human tutors with two control conditions: human tutors who were experts in the domain but not in tutoring and a no-tutoring condition. All conditions were supplemental to classroom instruction, and students took learning tests immediately before and after tutoring sessions as well as delayed tests 1-2 weeks later. Analysis using logistic mixed-effects modeling indicates significant positive effects on the immediate post-test for the ITS (d =.71) and human tutors (d =.66) which are in the 99th percentile of meta-analytic effects, as well as significant positive effects on the delayed post-test for the ITS (d =.36) and human tutors (d =.39). We discuss implications for the role of expertise in tutoring and the design of future studies."
2504.16133,"The interaction between humans and AI in safety-critical systems presents a unique set of challenges that remain partially addressed by existing frameworks. These challenges stem from the complex interplay of requirements for transparency, trust, and explainability, coupled with the necessity for robust and safe decision-making. A framework that holistically integrates human and AI capabilities while addressing these concerns is notably required, bridging the critical gaps in designing, deploying, and maintaining safe and effective systems. This paper proposes a holistic conceptual framework for critical infrastructures by adopting an interdisciplinary approach. It integrates traditionally distinct fields such as mathematics, decision theory, computer science, philosophy, psychology, and cognitive engineering and draws on specialized engineering domains, particularly energy, mobility, and aeronautics. Its flexibility is further demonstrated through a case study on power grid management."
2504.16135,"The aim is to create a method for accurately estimating the duration of post-cancer treatment, particularly focused on chemotherapy, to optimize patient care and recovery. This initiative seeks to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatment, emphasizing the significance of each patient's journey and well-being. Our focus is to provide patients with valuable insight into their treatment timeline because we deeply believe that every life matters. We combined medical expertise with smart technology to create a model that accurately predicted each patient's treatment timeline. By using machine learning, we personalized predictions based on individual patient details which were collected from a regional government hospital named Sylhet M.A.G. Osmani Medical College & Hospital, Sylhet, Bangladesh, improving cancer care effectively. We tackled the challenge by employing around 13 machine learning algorithms and analyzing 15 distinct features, including LR, SVM, DT, RF, etc. we obtained a refined precision in predicting cancer patient's treatment durations. Furthermore, we utilized ensemble techniques to reinforce the accuracy of our methods. Notably, our study revealed that our majority voting ensemble classifier displayed exceptional performance, achieving 77% accuracy, with LightGBM and Random Forest closely following at approximately 76% accuracy. Our research unveiled the inherent complexities of cancer datasets, as seen in the Decision Tree's 59% accuracy. This emphasizes the need for improved algorithms to better predict outcomes and enhance patient care. Our comparison with other methods confirmed our promising accuracy rates, showing the potential impact of our approach in improving cancer treatment strategies. This study marks a significant step forward in optimizing post-cancer treatment prognosis using machine learning and ensemble techniques."
2504.16137,"We present the Virology Capabilities Test (VCT), a large language model (LLM) benchmark that measures the capability to troubleshoot complex virology laboratory protocols. Constructed from the inputs of dozens of PhD-level expert virologists, VCT consists of $322$ multimodal questions covering fundamental, tacit, and visual knowledge that is essential for practical work in virology laboratories. VCT is difficult: expert virologists with access to the internet score an average of $22.1\%$ on questions specifically in their sub-areas of expertise. However, the most performant LLM, OpenAI's o3, reaches $43.8\%$ accuracy, outperforming $94\%$ of expert virologists even within their sub-areas of specialization. The ability to provide expert-level virology troubleshooting is inherently dual-use: it is useful for beneficial research, but it can also be misused. Therefore, the fact that publicly available models outperform virologists on VCT raises pressing governance considerations. We propose that the capability of LLMs to provide expert-level troubleshooting of dual-use virology work should be integrated into existing frameworks for handling dual-use technologies in the life sciences."
2504.16138,"Governments are starting to impose requirements on AI models based on how much compute was used to train them. For example, the EU AI Act imposes requirements on providers of general-purpose AI with systemic risk, which includes systems trained using greater than $10^{25}$ floating point operations (FLOP). In the United States' AI Diffusion Framework, a training compute threshold of $10^{26}$ FLOP is used to identify ""controlled models"" which face a number of requirements. We explore how many models such training compute thresholds will capture over time. We estimate that by the end of 2028, there will be between 103-306 foundation models exceeding the $10^{25}$ FLOP threshold put forward in the EU AI Act (90% CI), and 45-148 models exceeding the $10^{26}$ FLOP threshold that defines controlled models in the AI Diffusion Framework (90% CI). We also find that the number of models exceeding these absolute compute thresholds each year will increase superlinearly -- that is, each successive year will see more new models captured within the threshold than the year before. Thresholds that are defined with respect to the largest training run to date (for example, such that all models within one order of magnitude of the largest training run to date are captured by the threshold) see a more stable trend, with a median forecast of 14-16 models being captured by this definition annually from 2025-2028."
2504.16139,"As artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes industries and societies, ensuring its trustworthiness-through mitigating ethical risks like bias, opacity, and accountability deficits-remains a global challenge. International Organization for Standardization (ISO) AI standards, such as ISO/IEC 24027 and 24368, aim to foster responsible development by embedding fairness, transparency, and risk management into AI systems. However, their effectiveness varies across diverse regulatory landscapes, from the EU's risk-based AI Act to China's stability-focused measures and the U.S.'s fragmented state-led initiatives. This paper introduces a novel Comparative Risk-Impact Assessment Framework to evaluate how well ISO standards address ethical risks within these contexts, proposing enhancements to strengthen their global applicability. By mapping ISO standards to the EU AI Act and surveying regulatory frameworks in ten regions-including the UK, Canada, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Brazil-we establish a baseline for ethical alignment. The framework, applied to case studies in the EU, US-Colorado, and China, reveals gaps: voluntary ISO standards falter in enforcement (e.g., Colorado) and undervalue region-specific risks like privacy (China). We recommend mandatory risk audits, region-specific annexes, and a privacy-focused module to enhance ISO's adaptability. This approach not only synthesizes global trends but also offers a replicable tool for aligning standardization with ethical imperatives, fostering interoperability and trust in AI worldwide. Policymakers and standards bodies can leverage these insights to evolve AI governance, ensuring it meets diverse societal needs as the technology advances."
2504.16148,"Despite significant advancements in AI-driven educational systems and ongoing calls for responsible AI for education, several critical issues remain unresolved -- acting as the elephant in the room within AI in education, learning analytics, educational data mining, learning sciences, and educational psychology communities. This critical analysis identifies and examines nine persistent challenges that continue to undermine the fairness, transparency, and effectiveness of current AI methods and applications in education. These include: (1) the lack of clarity around what AI for education truly means -- often ignoring the distinct purposes, strengths, and limitations of different AI families -- and the trend of equating it with domain-agnostic, company-driven large language models; (2) the widespread neglect of essential learning processes such as motivation, emotion, and (meta)cognition in AI-driven learner modelling and their contextual nature; (3) limited integration of domain knowledge and lack of stakeholder involvement in AI design and development; (4) continued use of non-sequential machine learning models on temporal educational data; (5) misuse of non-sequential metrics to evaluate sequential models; (6) use of unreliable explainable AI methods to provide explanations for black-box models; (7) ignoring ethical guidelines in addressing data inconsistencies during model training; (8) use of mainstream AI methods for pattern discovery and learning analytics without systematic benchmarking; and (9) overemphasis on global prescriptions while overlooking localised, student-specific recommendations. Supported by theoretical and empirical research, we demonstrate how hybrid AI methods -- specifically neural-symbolic AI -- can address the elephant in the room and serve as the foundation for responsible, trustworthy AI systems in education."
2504.16153,"Saudi Arabias rapid economic growth and social evolution under Vision 2030 present a unique opportunity to track emerging trends in real time. Uncovering trends in real time can open up new avenues for business and investment opportunities. This paper explores how AI and social media analytics can uncover and monitor these trends across sectors like sustainability, construction, food beverages industry, tourism, technology, and entertainment. This paper focus on use of AI-driven methodology to identify sustainability trends across Saudi Arabia. We processed millions of social media posts, news, blogs in order to understand sustainability trends in the region. The paper presents an AI approach that can help economists, businesses, government to understand sustainability trends and make better decisions around them. This approach offers both sector-specific and cross-sector insights, giving decision-makers a reliable, up to date snapshot of Saudi Arabias market shifts. Beyond Saudi Arabia, this framework also shows potential for adapting to other regions. Overall, our findings highlight how by using AI-methodologies, give decision makers a reliable method to understand how initiatives are perceived and adopted by the public and understand growth of trends."
2504.16198,"Street network data is widely used to study human-based activities and urban structure. Often, these data are geared towards transportation applications, which require highly granular, directed graphs that capture the complex relationships of potential traffic patterns. While this level of network detail is critical for certain fine-grained mobility models, it represents a hindrance for studies concerned with the morphology of the street network. For the latter case, street network simplification - the process of converting a highly granular input network into its most simple morphological form - is a necessary, but highly tedious preprocessing step, especially when conducted manually. In this manuscript, we develop and present a novel adaptive algorithm for simplifying street networks that is both fully automated and able to mimic results obtained through a manual simplification routine. The algorithm - available in the neatnet Python package - outperforms current state-of-the-art procedures when comparing those methods to manually, human-simplified data, while preserving network continuity."
2504.16204,"Responsible prompt engineering has emerged as a critical framework for ensuring that generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems serve society's needs while minimizing potential harms. As generative AI applications become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, the way we instruct and interact with them through prompts has profound implications for fairness, accountability, and transparency. This article examines how strategic prompt engineering can embed ethical and legal considerations and societal values directly into AI interactions, moving beyond mere technical optimization for functionality. This article proposes a comprehensive framework for responsible prompt engineering that encompasses five interconnected components: prompt design, system selection, system configuration, performance evaluation, and prompt management. Drawing from empirical evidence, the paper demonstrates how each component can be leveraged to promote improved societal outcomes while mitigating potential risks. The analysis reveals that effective prompt engineering requires a delicate balance between technical precision and ethical consciousness, combining the systematic rigor and focus on functionality with the nuanced understanding of social impact. Through examination of real-world and emerging practices, the article illustrates how responsible prompt engineering serves as a crucial bridge between AI development and deployment, enabling organizations to fine-tune AI outputs without modifying underlying model architectures. This approach aligns with broader ""Responsibility by Design"" principles, embedding ethical considerations directly into the implementation process rather than treating them as post-hoc additions. The article concludes by identifying key research directions and practical guidelines for advancing the field of responsible prompt engineering."
2504.16546,"The ascent of scaling in artificial intelligence research has revolutionized the field over the past decade, yet it presents significant challenges for academic researchers, particularly in computational social science and critical algorithm studies. The dominance of large language models, characterized by their extensive parameters and costly training processes, creates a disparity where only industry-affiliated researchers can access these resources. This imbalance restricts academic researchers from fully understanding their tools, leading to issues like reproducibility in computational social science and a reliance on black-box metaphors in critical studies.To address these challenges, we propose a ""tinkering"" approach that is inspired by existing works. This method involves engaging with smaller models or components that are manageable for ordinary researchers, fostering hands-on interaction with algorithms. We argue that tinkering is both a way of making and knowing for computational social science and a way of knowing for critical studies, and fundamentally, it is a way of caring that has broader implications for both fields."
2504.16943,"The flexibility of a power generation unit determines how quickly and often it can ramp up or down. In energy models, it depends on assumptions on the technical characteristics of the unit, such as its installed capacity or turbine technology. In this paper, we learn the empirical flexibility of gas units from their electricity generation, revealing how real-world limitations can lead to substantial differences between units with similar technical characteristics. Using a novel deep clustering approach, we transform 5 years (2019-2023) of unit-level hourly generation data for 49 German units from 100 MWp of installed capacity into low-dimensional embeddings. Our unsupervised approach identifies two clusters of peaker units (high flexibility) and two clusters of non-peaker units (low flexibility). The estimated ramp rates of non-peakers, which constitute half of the sample, display a low empirical flexibility, comparable to coal units. Non-peakers, predominantly owned by industry and municipal utilities, show limited response to low residual load and negative prices, generating on average 1.3 GWh during those hours. As the transition to renewables increases market variability, regulatory changes will be needed to unlock this flexibility potential."
2504.16948,"Deep Foundation Models (DFMs) offer unprecedented capabilities but their increasing complexity presents profound challenges to understanding their internal workings-a critical need for ensuring trust, safety, and accountability. As we grapple with explaining these systems, a fundamental question emerges: Are the difficulties we face merely temporary hurdles, awaiting more sophisticated analytical techniques, or do they stem from \emph{intrinsic barriers} deeply rooted in the nature of these large-scale models themselves? This paper delves into this critical question by examining the fundamental characteristics of DFMs and scrutinizing the limitations encountered by current explainability methods when confronted with this inherent challenge. We probe the feasibility of achieving satisfactory explanations and consider the implications for how we must approach the verification and governance of these powerful technologies."
2504.16964,"The social dimension of sustainability seems to have been a notion rarely addressed in the literature (Dubois et al., 2001) until the early 2000s. The EUTIC 2023 symposium provides an opportunity to take up this topical issue. To this end, we are presenting an engagement process that is part of a sustainable development dynamic, based on digital tools inspired by everyday life, for applications in the context of training, with a view to lifelong learning. Our work, which stems from the information and communication sciences, is rooted in a multi-disciplinary approach that we believe can be echoed in a variety of disciplines, but which it is interesting to challenge, hence the purpose of this contribution."
2504.16966,"Computer science education has seen two important trends. One has been a shift from raw theory towards skills: competency-based teaching. Another has been increasing student numbers, with as a result more automation in teaching. When automating education, it is crucial to properly structure courses, both to manage digitalized educational resources and to facilitate automated coaching algorithms. Currently existing structuring methodologies are focused around theory and not around skills, and are incapable of modeling the dependency links between skills. Because of this, a new didactic framework is needed.This paper presents a new method of structuring educational contents around skills: something that a student is expected to be able to do. It defines Skill Trees that show dependencies between skills, and subsequently couples these to Concept Trees that contain intuitive ideas/notional machines. Due to the algorithmic nature of computer science, this step-wise approach is especially well-suited to this field of education. Next to formal definitions on Skill Trees and Concept Trees, guidelines are given on how to design them and how to plan a course using them.The Skill Trees framework has been applied to improve the structure of a university database course. Student interviews indicated reduced confusion/stress and less study time required for students to meet their desired skill level."
2504.16969,"Organizations developing machine learning-based (ML) technologies face the complex challenge of achieving high predictive performance while respecting the law. This intersection between ML and the law creates new complexities. As ML model behavior is inferred from training data, legal obligations cannot be operationalized in source code directly. Rather, legal obligations require ""indirect"" operationalization. However, choosing context-appropriate operationalizations presents two compounding challenges: (1) laws often permit multiple valid operationalizations for a given legal obligation-each with varying degrees of legal adequacy; and, (2) each operationalization creates unpredictable trade-offs among the different legal obligations and with predictive performance. Evaluating these trade-offs requires metrics (or heuristics), which are in turn difficult to validate against legal obligations. Current methodologies fail to fully address these interwoven challenges as they either focus on legal compliance for traditional software or on ML model development without adequately considering legal complexities. In response, we introduce a five-stage interdisciplinary framework that integrates legal and ML-technical analysis during ML model development. This framework facilitates designing ML models in a legally aligned way and identifying high-performing models that are legally justifiable. Legal reasoning guides choices for operationalizations and evaluation metrics, while ML experts ensure technical feasibility, performance optimization and an accurate interpretation of metric values. This framework bridges the gap between more conceptual analysis of law and ML models' need for deterministic specifications. We illustrate its application using a case study in the context of anti-money laundering."
2504.16974,"The past years witnessed a significant amount of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools that can generate images from texts. This triggers the discussion of whether AI can generate accurate images using text from the Bible with respect to the corresponding biblical contexts and backgrounds. Despite some existing attempts at a small scale, little work has been done to systematically evaluate these generated images. In this work, we provide a large dataset of over 7K images using biblical text as prompts. These images were evaluated with multiple neural network-based tools on various aspects. We provide an assessment of accuracy and some analysis from the perspective of religion and aesthetics. Finally, we discuss the use of the generated images and reflect on the performance of the AI generators."

2504.1705,"This study proposes a prototype for locating important individuals and financial exchanges in networks of people trafficking that have grown during the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. It focuses on the role of digital platforms, cryptocurrencies, and the dark web in facilitating these operations. The research maps trafficking networks and identifies key players and financial flows by utilizing open-source intelligence (OSINT), social network analysis (SNA), and blockchain analysis. The results show how cryptocurrencies are used for anonymous transactions and imply that upsetting central coordinators may cause wider networks to become unstable. In order to combat human trafficking, the study emphasizes the significance of real-time data sharing between international law enforcement. It also identifies future directions for the development of improved monitoring tools and cooperative platforms."
2504.17054,"The Internet of Things (IoT) presents unique cybersecurity challenges due to its interconnected nature and diverse application domains. This paper explores the application of Cyber Value-at-Risk (Cy-VaR) models to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks in IoT environments. Cy-VaR, rooted in Value at Risk principles, provides a framework to quantify the potential financial impacts of cybersecurity incidents. Initially developed to evaluate overall risk exposure across scenarios, our approach extends Cy-VaR to consider specific IoT layers: perception, network, and application. Each layer encompasses distinct functionalities and vulnerabilities, from sensor data acquisition (perception layer) to secure data transmission (network layer) and application-specific services (application layer). By calculating Cy- VaR for each layer and scenario, organizations can prioritize security investments effectively. This paper discusses methodologies and models, including scenario-based Cy-VaR and layer-specific risk assessments, emphasizing their application in enhancing IoT cybersecurity resilience."
2504.17056,"Energy-poor households often compromise their thermal comfort and refrain from operating mechanical cooling devices to avoid high electricity bills. This is compounded by certain behavioral practices like retention of older, less efficient appliances, resulting in missed energy savings. Thus, the need to enhance efficiency becomes critical in these households. However, due to a lack of comprehensive data in India, little is understood about their electricity consumption patterns and usage efficiency. Estimating inefficiency and assessing its determinants is crucial for improving their quality of life. This study measures the inefficiency in electricity consumption due to household practices and appliances in social housing in Mumbai, India. It considers technological determinants in addition to socio-economic variables. The study employs primary data collected from rehabilitation housing and slums in Mumbai. Stochastic frontier analysis, a parametric approach, is applied to estimate indicators of electricity consumption and inefficiency. While household size and workforce participation significantly affect consumption behavior in rehabilitation housing, it is limited to the workforce in slums. The ownership of appliances, except for washing machines in slums, also exhibits considerable impacts. The mean efficiency scores of 83% and 91% for rehabilitation housing and slums, respectively, empirically quantify the potential savings achievable. Factors that positively influence inefficiency include the duration of operating refrigerators, washing machines, iron, and AC. These results hold implications for enhancing the uptake of efficient appliances in addition to accelerating energy efficiency retrofits in the region. Policies should focus on awareness and the development of appliance markets through incentives."
2504.17113,"We report an 18-month field experiment in distributed digital institutions: a nine-bedroom Los Angeles coliving house that runs without managers, while sustaining 98% occupancy and below-market rents.Drawing on Elinor Ostrom's commons theory, we outline design principles and three digital mechanisms that form the institutional core: 1) A continuous-auction chore scheduler turns regenerative labor into a time-indexed points market; residents meet a 100-point monthly obligation by claiming tasks whose value rises linearly with neglect. 2) A pairwise-preference layer lets participants asynchronously reprioritize tasks, translating meta-governance into low-cognition spot inputs. 3) A symbolic ""hearts"" ledger tracks norm compliance through automated enforcement, lightweight challenges, and peer-awarded karma. Together, these mechanisms operationalize cybernetic principles--human sensing, machine bookkeeping, real-time feedback--while minimizing dependence on privileged roles.Our exploratory data (567 chore claims, 255 heart events, and 551 group purchases) show that such tooling can sustain reliable commons governance without continuous leadership, offering a transferable design palette for online communities, coliving houses, and other digitally mediated collectives."

Educator insights show key considerations for accessible AI, including the importance of engagement, intuitive design, compatibility with existing assistive technologies, and the role of positive reinforcement in maintaining student motivation. Beyond accessibility, this paper explores the ethical implications of AI in education, emphasizing data privacy, security, and transparency. Audemy demonstrates how AI can empower BVI students with personalized and equitable learning opportunities, advancing the broader goal of inclusive education."
2504.17146,"The premise of network statistics derived from Google Trends data to foresee COVID-19 disease progression is gaining momentum in infodemiology. This approach was applied in Metro Manila, National Capital Region, Philippines. Through dynamic time warping (DTW), the temporal alignment was quantified between network metrics and COVID-19 case trajectories, and systematically explored 320 parameter configurations including two network metrics (network density and clustering coefficient), two data preprocessing methods (Rescaling Daily Data and MSV), multiple thresholds, two correlation window sizes, and Sakoe-Chiba band constraints. Results from the Kruskal-Wallis tests revealed that five of the six parameters significantly influenced alignment quality, with the disease comparison type (active cases vs. confirmed cases) demonstrating the strongest effect. The optimal configuration, which is using the network density statistic with a Rescaling Daily Data transformation, a threshold of 0.8, a 15-day window, and a 50-day radius constraint, achieved a DTW score of 36.30. This indicated substantial temporal alignment with the COVID-19 confirmed cases data. The discoveries demonstrate that network metrics rooted from online search behavior can serve as complementary indicators for epidemic surveillance in urban locations like Metro Manila. This strategy leverages the Philippines' extensive online usage during the pandemic to provide potentially valuable early signals of disease spread, and offers a supplementary tool for public health monitoring in resource-limited situations."
2504.17248,"This study investigates the relationship between Carl Jung's cognitive functions and success in computer industry careers by analyzing the distribution of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) types among professionals in the field. Building on Carl Jung's theory of psychological types, which categorizes human cognition into four primary functions, Sensing, Intuition, Thinking, and Feeling, this study investigates how these functions, when combined with the attitudes of Extraversion and Introversion, influence personality types and career choices in the tech sector. Through a comprehensive analysis of data from 30 studies spanning multiple countries and decades, encompassing 18,264 individuals in computer-related professions, we identified the most prevalent cognitive functions and their combinations. After normalizing the data against general population distributions, our findings showed that individual Jungian functions (Te, Ni, Ti, Ne), dual function combinations (Ni-Te, Ti-Ne, Si-Te, Ni-Fe), and MBTI types (INTJ, ENTJ, INTP, ENTP, ISTJ, INFJ, ESTJ, ESTP) had significantly higher representation compared to general population norms. The paper addresses gaps in the existing literature by providing a more nuanced understanding of how cognitive functions impact job performance and team dynamics, offering insights for career guidance, team composition, and professional development in the computer industry, and a deeper understanding of how cognitive preferences influence career success in technology-related fields."

It reveals the challenges in this area and proposes a sustainable supply chain framework for indigenous knowledge. The paper reviews existing technological solutions and identifies technical challenges and gaps. It then introduces cutting-edge technologies to protect and disseminate indigenous knowledge more effectively. The paper also discusses how the proposed framework can address real-world challenges in protecting and transmitting indigenous knowledge, and explores future research applications of the proposed solutions. Finally, it addresses open issues and provides a detailed analysis, offering promising research directions for the protection and transmission of indigenous knowledge worldwide."
2504.17393,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important part of our everyday lives, yet user requirements for designing AI-assisted systems in law enforcement remain unclear. To address this gap, we conducted qualitative research on decision-making within a law enforcement agency. Our study aimed to identify limitations of existing practices, explore user requirements and understand the responsibilities that humans expect to undertake in these systems.Participants in our study highlighted the need for a system capable of processing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently to help in crime detection and prevention. Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements for scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to be adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of having end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to interpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy. To keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users need to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and government guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and monitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the system is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed they would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the system can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the system will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature of the law enforcement domain."
2504.17678,"With the wide application of IoT and industrial IoT technologies, the network structure is becoming more and more complex, and the traffic scale is growing rapidly, which makes the traditional security protection mechanism face serious challenges in dealing with high-frequency, diversified, and stealthy cyber-attacks. To address this problem, this study proposes MindFlow, a multi-dimensional dynamic traffic prediction and anomaly detection system combining convolutional neural network (CNN) and bi-directional long and short-term memory network (BiLSTM) architectures based on the MindSpore framework, and conducts systematic experiments on the NF-BoT-IoT dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 99% in key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, effectively verifying its accuracy and robustness in network intrusion detection."
2504.17823,"While analysing challenges in pilot projects developing AI with marginalized communities, we found it difficult to express them within commonly used paradigms. We therefore constructed an alternative conceptual framework to ground AI development in the social fabric -- the Cloud Weaving Model -- inspired (amongst others) by indigenous knowledge, motifs from nature, and Eastern traditions. This paper introduces and elaborates on the fundamental elements of the model (clouds, spiders, threads, spiderwebs, and weather) and their interpretation in an AI context. The framework is then applied to comprehend patterns observed in co-creation pilots approaching marginalized communities, highlighting neglected yet relevant dimensions for responsible AI development."
2504.17833,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), offering new capabilities in data processing, spatial analysis, and decision support. This paper examines the open-source paradigm's critical role in this transformation. While proprietary LLMs offer accessibility, they often limit the customization, interoperability, and transparency vital for specialized geospatial tasks. Conversely, open-source alternatives significantly advance Geographic Information Science (GIScience) by fostering greater adaptability, reproducibility, and community-driven innovation. Open frameworks empower researchers to tailor solutions, integrate cutting-edge methodologies (e.g., reinforcement learning, advanced spatial indexing), and align with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. However, the growing reliance on any LLM necessitates careful consideration of security vulnerabilities, ethical risks, and robust governance for AI-generated geospatial outputs. This paper argues that GIScience advances best not through a single model type, but by cultivating a diverse, interoperable ecosystem combining open-source foundations for innovation, custom geospatial models, and interdisciplinary collaboration. By critically evaluating the opportunities and challenges of open-source LLMs within the broader GeoAI landscape, this work contributes to a thorough discourse on leveraging LLMs to effectively advance spatial research, policy, and decision-making in an equitable, sustainable, and scientifically rigorous manner."
2504.17897,"Physical inactivity significantly contributes to obesity and other non-communicable diseases, yet efforts to increase population-wide physical activity levels have met with limited success. The built environment plays a pivotal role in encouraging active behaviors like walking. Walkability indices, which aggregate various environmental features, provide a valuable tool for promoting healthy, walkable environments. However, a standardized, high-resolution walkability index for Europe has been lacking. This study addresses that gap by developing a standardized, high-resolution walkability index for the entire European region. Seven core components were selected to define walkability: walkable street length, intersection density, green spaces, slope, public transport access, land use mix, and 15-minute walking isochrones. These were derived from harmonized, high-resolution datasets such as Sentinel-2, NASA's elevation models, OpenStreetMap, and CORINE Land Cover. A 100 m x 100 m hierarchical grid system and advanced geospatial methods, like network buffers and distance decay, were used at scale to efficiently model real-world density and proximity effects. The resulting index was weighted by population and analyzed at different spatial levels using visual mapping, spatial clustering, and correlation analysis. Findings revealed a distinct urban-to-rural gradient, with high walkability scores concentrated in compact urban centers rich in street connectivity and land use diversity. The index highlighted cities like Barcelona, Berlin, Munich, Paris, and Warsaw as walkability leaders. This standardized, high-resolution walkability index serves as a practical tool for researchers, planners, and policymakers aiming to support active living and public health across diverse European contexts."
2504.18044,"Using LLMs in healthcare, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and Social Computing requires the examination of ethical and social norms to ensure safe incorporation into human life. We conducted a mixed-method study, including an online survey with 111 participants and an interview study with 38 experts, to investigate the AI ethics and social norms in ChatGPT as everyday life tools. This study aims to evaluate whether ChatGPT in an empirical context operates following ethics and social norms, which is critical for understanding actions in industrial and academic research and achieving machine ethics. The findings of this study provide initial insights into six important aspects of AI ethics, including bias, trustworthiness, security, toxicology, social norms, and ethical data. Significant obstacles related to transparency and bias in unsupervised data collection methods are identified as ChatGPT's ethical concerns."
2504.18081,"New technologies create opportunities while displacing others. They enhance life by supporting entertainment, education, and social connectivity but also replace humans in productivity and analytical tasks. Adapting to these shifts requires technical adjustments and social readiness. For digital transformation to succeed, organizations and their workforce must be psychologically prepared. We are entering the era of Generative AI with tools like ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Microsoft Office Copilot. Understanding public sentiment toward these innovations is crucial for refining technology acceptance models and informing market strategies. Using the Gartner Hype Cycle and Kubler-Ross Change Curve, this study suggests that generative AI adoption is a dual-stage process. It follows the phases of technology trigger, peak of expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity, while also reflecting emotional stages like shock, denial, and integration. The study used sentiment and emotion analysis on a large dataset of tweets about generative AI, translating them into scores to track user responses over time. Unlike prior research, which offered a snapshot of sentiment, this study captures the dynamic evolution of attitudes, linking empirical evidence with theoretical frameworks. It shifts the focus from information seekers to content creators. With the release of generative AI tools, there is a significant gap in understanding societal reception and adaptation. Policymakers face uncertainty about guiding markets for these changes. This research validates the applicability of the Gartner Hype Cycle and Kubler-Ross Change Curve to generative AI. It provides insights for businesses in integrating these tools and crafting policies to enhance readiness and resilience."
2504.18169,"The well-being of older adults relies significantly on maintaining balance and mobility. As physical ability declines, older adults often accept the need for assistive devices. However, existing walkers frequently fail to consider user preferences, leading to perceptions of imposition and reduced acceptance. This research explores the challenges faced by older adults, caregivers, and healthcare professionals when using walkers, assesses their perceptions, and identifies their needs and preferences. A holistic approach was employed, using tailored perception questionnaires for older adults (24 participants), caregivers (30 participants), and healthcare professionals (27 participants), all of whom completed the survey. Over 50% of caregivers and healthcare professionals displayed good knowledge, positive attitudes, and effective practices regarding walkers. However, over 30% of participants perceived current designs as fall risks, citing the need for significant upper body strength, potentially affecting safety and movement. More than 50% highlighted the importance of incorporating fall detection, ergonomic designs, noise reduction, and walker ramps to better meet user needs and preferences."
2504.18222,"Agricultural field operations are generally tracked as work records (WR), incorporating data points such as; work type, machine type, timestamped trajectories and field information. WR data which is automatically recorded by modern machinery equipped with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can enable efficient farm management decision making. Globally, farmers often rely on aged or legacy farming machinery and manual data recording, which introduces significant labor costs and increases the risk of inaccurate data input. To address this challenge, a field study in Central Japan was conducted to showcase automated data collection by retrofitting legacy farming machinery with low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) devices. For single-purpose vehicles (SPV), which only carry out single work types such as planting, LTE (Long Term Evolution) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) units were installed to record trajectory data. For multi-purpose vehicles (MPV), such as tractors which perform multiple work types, the configuration settings of these vehicles had to include implements and attachments data. To obtain this data, industry standard LTE-GNSS Bluetooth gateways were fitted onto MPV and low-cost BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacons were attached to implements. After installation, over a seven-month field preparation and planting period 1,623 WR, including 421 WR for SPV and 1,120 WR for MVP, were automatically obtained. For MPV, the WR included detailed configuration settings enabling detection of the specific work types. These findings demonstrate the potential of low cost IoT GNSS devices for precision agriculture strategies to support management decisions in farming operations."
2504.18236,"Explainability and its emerging counterpart contestability have become important normative and design principles for trustworthy AI as they enable users and subjects to understand and challenge AI decisions. However, realizing these principles is difficult, as they assume different meanings in technical, legal, and organizational dimensions of AI regulation. To resolve this conceptual polysemy, in this paper, we present the findings of an interview study with 14 experts to examine the intersection and implementation of explainability and contestability, and their understanding in different research communities. We outline differentiations between descriptive and normative explainability, judicial and non-judicial channels of contestation, and individual and collective contestation action. We further describe the main points of friction in the realization of both principles, including the alignment between top-down and bottom-up regulation, the assignment of responsibility, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. Lastly, we formulate three recommendations for AI policy to implement both principles through a Regulation by Design perspective. We believe our contributions can inform policy-making and regulation of these core principles and enable more effective and equitable design, development, and deployment of trustworthy public AI systems."
2504.18328,"Assuring safety of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to safety-critical systems is of paramount importance. Especially since research in the field of automated driving shows that AI is able to outperform classical approaches, to handle higher complexities, and to reach new levels of autonomy. At the same time, the safety assurance required for the use of AI in such safety-critical systems is still not in place. Due to the dynamic and far-reaching nature of the technology, research on safeguarding AI is being conducted in parallel to AI standardization and regulation. The parallel progress necessitates simultaneous consideration in order to carry out targeted research and development of AI systems in the context of automated driving. Therefore, in contrast to existing surveys that focus primarily on research aspects, this paper considers research, standardization and regulation in a concise way. Accordingly, the survey takes into account the interdependencies arising from the triplet of research, standardization and regulation in a forward-looking perspective and anticipates and discusses open questions and possible future directions. In this way, the survey ultimately serves to provide researchers and safety experts with a compact, holistic perspective that discusses the current status, emerging trends, and possible future developments."
2504.18601,"In the face of rapidly advancing AI technology, individuals will increasingly rely on AI agents to navigate life's growing complexities, raising critical concerns about maintaining both human agency and autonomy. This paper addresses a fundamental dilemma posed by AI decision-support systems: the risk of either becoming overwhelmed by complex decisions, thus losing agency, or having autonomy compromised by externally controlled choice architectures reminiscent of ``nudging'' practices. While the ``nudge'' framework, based on the use of choice-framing to guide individuals toward presumed beneficial outcomes, initially appeared to preserve liberty, at AI-driven scale, it threatens to erode autonomy. To counteract this risk, the paper proposes a philosophic turn in AI design. AI should be constructed to facilitate decentralized truth-seeking and open-ended inquiry, mirroring the Socratic method of philosophical dialogue. By promoting individual and collective adaptive learning, such AI systems would empower users to maintain control over their judgments, augmenting their agency without undermining autonomy. The paper concludes by outlining essential features for autonomy-preserving AI systems, sketching a path toward AI systems that enhance human judgment rather than undermine it."
2504.18602,"We talk of the internet as digital infrastructure; but we leave the building of rails and roads to the quasi-monopolistic platform providers. Decentralised architectures provide a number of advantages: They are potentially more inclusive for small players; more resilient against adversarial events; and seem to generate more innovation. However, it is not well understood how to evolve, adapt and govern decentralised infrastructures. This article reports qualitative empirical research on the development and governance of the Beckn Protocol, an open source protocol for decentralised transactions, the successful development of domain-specific adaptations, and implementation and scaling of commercial infrastructures based on it. It explores how the architecture and governance support local innovation for specific business domains, and how the domain-specific innovations feed back into the development of the core concept The research applied a case study approach, combining interviews with core members of the Beckn community; triangulated by interviews with community leaders of domain specific adaptations and by analysis of online documents and the protocol itself. The article shows the possibility of such a decentralised approach to IT Infrastructures. It analyses the Beckn Protocol, domain specific adaptations, and networks built as a software ecosystem. Based on this analysis, a number of generative mechanisms, socio-technical arrangements that support adoption, innovation, and scaling of infrastructures are highlighted."
2504.18603,"Quantum computing education faces significant challenges due to its complexity and the limitations of current tools; this paper introduces a novel Intelligent Teaching Assistant for quantum computing education and details its evolutionary design process. The system combines a knowledge-graph-augmented architecture with two specialized Large Language Model (LLM) agents: a Teaching Agent for dynamic interaction, and a Lesson Planning Agent for lesson plan generation. The system is designed to adapt to individual student needs, with interactions meticulously tracked and stored in a knowledge graph. This graph represents student actions, learning resources, and relationships, aiming to enable reasoning about effective learning pathways. We describe the implementation of the system, highlighting the challenges encountered and the solutions implemented, including introducing a dual-agent architecture where tasks are separated, all coordinated through a central knowledge graph that maintains system awareness, and a user-facing tag system intended to mitigate LLM hallucination and improve user control. Preliminary results illustrate the system's potential to capture rich interaction data, dynamically adapt lesson plans based on student feedback via a tag system in simulation, and facilitate context-aware tutoring through the integrated knowledge graph, though systematic evaluation is required."
2504.18629,"Racial disparities in recidivism remain a persistent challenge within the criminal justice system, increasingly exacerbated by the adoption of algorithmic risk assessment tools. Past works have primarily focused on bias induced by these tools, treating recidivism as a binary outcome. Limited attention has been given to non-algorithmic factors (including socioeconomic ones) in driving racial disparities from a systemic perspective. To that end, this work presents a multi-stage causal framework to investigate the advent and extent of disparities by considering time-to-recidivism rather than a simple binary outcome. The framework captures interactions among races, the algorithm, and contextual factors. This work introduces the notion of counterfactual racial disparity and offers a formal test using survival analysis that can be conducted with observational data to assess if differences in recidivism arise from algorithmic bias, contextual factors, or their interplay. In particular, it is formally established that if sufficient statistical evidence for differences across racial groups is observed, it would support rejecting the null hypothesis that non-algorithmic factors (including socioeconomic ones) do not affect recidivism. An empirical study applying this framework to the COMPAS dataset reveals that short-term recidivism patterns do not exhibit racial disparities when controlling for risk scores. However, statistically significant disparities emerge with longer follow-up periods, particularly for low-risk groups. This suggests that factors beyond algorithmic scores, possibly structural disparities in housing, employment, and social support, may accumulate and exacerbate recidivism risks over time. This underscores the need for policy interventions extending beyond algorithmic improvements to address broader influences on recidivism trajectories."
2504.19264,"This paper explores the integration of human rights considerations into AI regulatory frameworks across different IEEE regions - specifically the United States (Region 1-6), Europe (Region 8), China (part of Region 10), and Singapore (part of Region 10). While all acknowledge the transformative potential of AI and the necessity of ethical guidelines, their regulatory approaches significantly differ. Europe exhibits a rigorous framework with stringent protections for individual rights, while the U.S. promotes innovation with less restrictive regulations. China emphasizes state control and societal order in its AI strategies. In contrast, Singapore's advisory framework encourages self-regulation and aligns closely with international norms. This comparative analysis underlines the need for ongoing global dialogue to harmonize AI regulations that safeguard human rights while promoting technological advancement, reflecting the diverse perspectives and priorities of each region."
2504.19275,"The integration of Artificial Intelligence(AI) into film production has revolutionized efficiency and creativity, yet it simultaneously raises critical ethical and practical challenges. This study explores the dual impact of AI on modern cinema through three objectives: defining the optimal human-AI relationship, balancing creativity with automation, and developing ethical guidelines. By employing a mixed-method approach combining theoretical frameworks (auteur theory, human-technology relations) and case studies (The Safe Zone, Fast & Furious 7, The Brutalist), the research reveals that positioning AI as an ""embodiment tool"" rather than an independent ""alterity partner"" preserves human authorship and artistic integrity. Key findings highlight the risks of surveillance capitalism in AI-driven markets and the ethical dilemmas of deepfake technology. The study concludes with actionable recommendations, including international regulatory frameworks and a Human Control Index (HCI) to quantify AI involvement. These insights aim to guide filmmakers, policymakers, and scholars in navigating the evolving AI-cinema landscape while safeguarding cultural diversity and ethical standards."
2504.19673,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT are emerging as a revolutionary tool in education that brings both positive aspects and challenges for educators and students, reshaping how learning and teaching are approached. This study aims to identify and evaluate the key competencies students need to effectively engage with GenAI in education and to provide strategies for lecturers to integrate GenAI into teaching practices. The study applied a mixed method approach with a combination of a literature review and a quantitative survey involving 130 students from South Asia and Europe to obtain its findings. The literature review identified 14 essential student skills for GenAI engagement, with AI literacy, critical thinking, and ethical AI practices emerging as the most critical. The student survey revealed gaps in prompt engineering, bias awareness, and AI output management. In our study of lecturer strategies, we identified six key areas, with GenAI Integration and Curriculum Design being the most emphasised. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating GenAI into education. While literature prioritized ethics and policy development, students favour hands-on, project-based learning and practical AI applications. To foster inclusive and responsible GenAI adoption, institutions should ensure equitable access to GenAI tools, establish clear academic integrity policies, and advocate for global GenAI research initiatives."
2504.1999,"Societal cognitive overload, driven by the deluge of information and complexity in the AI age, poses a critical challenge to human well-being and societal resilience. This paper argues that mitigating cognitive overload is not only essential for improving present-day life but also a crucial prerequisite for navigating the potential risks of advanced AI, including existential threats. We examine how AI exacerbates cognitive overload through various mechanisms, including information proliferation, algorithmic manipulation, automation anxieties, deregulation, and the erosion of meaning. The paper reframes the AI safety debate to center on cognitive overload, highlighting its role as a bridge between near-term harms and long-term risks. It concludes by discussing potential institutional adaptations, research directions, and policy considerations that arise from adopting an overload-resilient perspective on human-AI alignment, suggesting pathways for future exploration rather than prescribing definitive solutions."
2504.20075,"With the adoption of the EU AI Act, companies must understand and implement its compliance requirements -- an often complex task, especially in areas like risk management and fundamental rights assessments. This paper introduces our High-risk EU AI Act Toolkit(HEAT), which offers a pro-justice, feminist ethics-informed approach to support meaningful compliance. HEAT not only helps teams meet regulatory standards but also translates ethical theory into practice. We show how feminist perspectives on expertise, stakeholder engagement, accessibility, and environmental justice inform HEAT's methods and expand on the Act's baseline. The theories we draw on are not naively utopian. Instead, they inspire non-innocent approaches to interrogating normativity in systems of all kinds -- technological and otherwise. By this we mean that pro-justice orientations are cognizant of their involvement in the systems they seek to critique, and offer best practices with how to grapple with the trade-offs inherent in reducing and eradicating harmful behaviour from within. These best practices, as we explain in this paper, are what HEAT both embodies and enables."
2504.20185,"The widespread adoption of AI in recent years has led to the emergence of AI supply chains: complex networks of AI actors contributing models, datasets, and more to the development of AI products and services. AI supply chains have many implications yet are poorly understood. In this work, we take a first step toward a formal study of AI supply chains and their implications, providing two illustrative case studies indicating that both AI development and regulation are complicated in the presence of supply chains. We begin by presenting a brief historical perspective on AI supply chains, discussing how their rise reflects a longstanding shift towards specialization and outsourcing that signals the healthy growth of the AI industry. We then model AI supply chains as directed graphs and demonstrate the power of this abstraction by connecting examples of AI issues to graph properties. Finally, we examine two case studies in detail, providing theoretical and empirical results in both. In the first, we show that information passing (specifically, of explanations) along the AI supply chains is imperfect, which can result in misunderstandings that have real-world implications. In the second, we show that upstream design choices (e.g., by base model providers) have downstream consequences (e.g., on AI products fine-tuned on the base model). Together, our findings motivate further study of AI supply chains and their increasingly salient social, economic, regulatory, and technical implications."
2504.20215,"This study explores the application of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to AI-powered digital innovations within a transnational governance framework. By integrating Latourian actor-network theory (ANT), this study examines how institutional motivations, regulatory compliance, and ethical and cultural acceptance drive organisations to develop and adopt AI innovations, enhancing their market acceptance and transnational accountability. We extend the TAM framework by incorporating regulatory, ethical, and socio-technical considerations as key social pressures shaping AI adoption. Recognizing that AI is embedded within complex actor-networks, we argue that accountability is co-constructed among organisations, regulators, and societal actors rather than being confined to individual developers or adopters. To address these challenges, we propose two key solutions: (1) internal resource reconfiguration, where organisations restructure their governance and compliance mechanisms to align with global standards; and (2) reshaping organisational boundaries through actor-network management, fostering engagement with external stakeholders, regulatory bodies, and transnational governance institutions. These approaches allow organisations to enhance AI accountability, foster ethical and regulatory alignment, and improve market acceptance on a global scale."
2504.20519,"Large language model (LLM) based chatbots show promise in persuasive communication, but existing studies often rely on weak controls or focus on belief change rather than behavioral intentions or outcomes. This pre-registered multi-country (US, Canada, UK) randomized controlled trial involving 930 vaccine-hesitant parents evaluated brief (three-minute) multi-turn conversations with LLM-based chatbots against standard public health messaging approaches for increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine intentions for their children. Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) a weak control (no message), (2) a strong control reflecting the standard of care (reading official public health materials), or (3 and 4) one of two chatbot conditions. One chatbot was prompted to deliver short, conversational responses, while the other used the model's default output style (longer with bullet points). While chatbot interactions significantly increased self-reported vaccination intent (by 7.1-10.3 points on a 100-point scale) compared to no message, they did not outperform standard public health materials, with the conversational chatbot performing significantly worse. Additionally, while the short-term effects of chatbot interactions faded during a 15-day follow-up, the effects of public health material persisted through a 45-day follow-up relative to no message. These findings suggest that while LLMs can effectively shift vaccination intentions in the short-term, their incremental value over existing public health communications is questionable, offering a more tempered view of their persuasive capabilities and highlighting the importance of integrating AI-driven tools alongside, rather than replacing, current public health strategies."
2504.20838,"This paper investigates whether Bitcoin can be regarded as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), what insights it may offer for the broader DAO ecosystem, and how Bitcoin governance can be improved. First, a quantitative literature analysis reveals that Bitcoin is increasingly overlooked in DAO research, even though early works often classified it as a DAO. Next, the paper applies a DAO viability framework - centering on collective intelligence, digital democracy, and adaptation - to examine Bitcoin's organizational and governance mechanisms. Findings suggest that Bitcoin instantitates key DAO principles by enabling open participation, and employing decentralized decision-making through Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), miner signaling, and user-activated soft forks. However, this governance carries potential risks, including reduced clarity on who truly 'votes' due to the concentration of economic power among large stakeholders. The paper concludes by highlighting opportunities to refine Bitcoin's deliberation process and reflecting on broader implications for DAO design, such as the absence of a legal entity. In doing so, it underscores Bitcoin's continued relevance as an archetype for decentralized governance, offering important findings for future DAO implementations."

2504.2091,"Red-teaming is a core part of the infrastructure that ensures that AI models do not produce harmful content. Unlike past technologies, the black box nature of generative AI systems necessitates a uniquely interactional mode of testing, one in which individuals on red teams actively interact with the system, leveraging natural language to simulate malicious actors and solicit harmful outputs. This interactional labor done by red teams can result in mental health harms that are uniquely tied to the adversarial engagement strategies necessary to effectively red team. The importance of ensuring that generative AI models do not propagate societal or individual harm is widely recognized -- one less visible foundation of end-to-end AI safety is also the protection of the mental health and wellbeing of those who work to keep model outputs safe. In this paper, we argue that the unmet mental health needs of AI red-teamers is a critical workplace safety concern. Through analyzing the unique mental health impacts associated with the labor done by red teams, we propose potential individual and organizational strategies that could be used to meet these needs, and safeguard the mental health of red-teamers. We develop our proposed strategies through drawing parallels between common red-teaming practices and interactional labor common to other professions (including actors, mental health professionals, conflict photographers, and content moderators), describing how individuals and organizations within these professional spaces safeguard their mental health given similar psychological demands. Drawing on these protective practices, we describe how safeguards could be adapted for the distinct mental health challenges experienced by red teaming organizations as they mitigate emerging technological risks on the new digital frontlines."
2504.21032,"The perceived quality of the explanations accompanying e-government services is key to gaining trust in these institutions, consequently amplifying further usage of these services. Recent advances in generative AI, and concretely in Large Language Models (LLMs) allow the automation of such content articulations, eliciting explanations' interpretability and fidelity, and more generally, adapting content to various audiences. However, selecting the right LLM type for this has become a non-trivial task for e-government service providers. In this work, we adapted a previously developed scale to assist with this selection, providing a systematic approach for the comparative analysis of the perceived quality of explanations generated by various LLMs. We further demonstrated its applicability through the tax-return process, using it as an exemplar use case that could benefit from employing an LLM to generate explanations about tax refund decisions. This was attained through a user study with 128 survey respondents who were asked to rate different versions of LLM-generated explanations about tax refund decisions, providing a methodological basis for selecting the most appropriate LLM. Recognizing the practical challenges of conducting such a survey, we also began exploring the automation of this process by attempting to replicate human feedback using a selection of cutting-edge predictive techniques."
2504.21185,"This study explores the integration of AI in transportation electrification planning in Austin, TX, focusing on the use of Geospatial AI (GeoAI), Generative AI (GenAI), and Large Language Models (LLMs). GeoAI enhances site selection, localized GenAI models support meta-level estimations, and LLMs enable scenario simulations. These AI applications require human oversight. GeoAI outputs must be evaluated with land use data, GenAI models are not always accurate, and LLMs are prone to hallucinations. To ensure accountable planning, human planners must work alongside AI agents. Establishing a community feedback loop is essential to audit automated decisions. Planners should place Community Experience (CX) at the center of Urban Planning AI."
2504.21259,"Accurate imputation of race and ethnicity (R&E) is crucial for analyzing disparities and informing policy. Methods like Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) are widely used but exhibit limitations, including systematic misclassification biases linked to socioeconomic status. This paper introduces LSTM+Geo, a novel approach enhancing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with census tract geolocation information. Using a large voter dataset, we demonstrate that LSTM+Geo (88.7% accuracy) significantly outperforms standalone LSTM (86.4%) and Bayesian methods like BISG (82.9%) and BIFSG (86.8%) in accuracy and F1-score on a held-out validation set. LSTM+Geo reduces the rate at which non-White individuals are misclassified as White (White FPR 19.3%) compared to name-only LSTMs (White FPR 24.6%). While sophisticated ensemble methods incorporating XGBoost achieve the highest overall accuracy (up to 89.4%) and lowest White FPR (17.8%), LSTM+Geo offers strong standalone performance with improved bias characteristics compared to baseline models. Integrating LSTM+Geo into an XGBoost ensemble further boosts accuracy, highlighting its utility as both a standalone model and a component for advanced systems. We give a caution at the end regarding the appropriate use of these methods."
2504.21489,"The proliferation of generative AI and deceptive synthetic media threatens the global information ecosystem, especially across the Global Majority. This report from WITNESS highlights the limitations of current AI detection tools, which often underperform in real-world scenarios due to challenges related to explainability, fairness, accessibility, and contextual relevance. In response, WITNESS introduces the Truly Innovative and Effective AI Detection (TRIED) Benchmark, a new framework for evaluating detection tools based on their real-world impact and capacity for innovation. Drawing on frontline experiences, deceptive AI cases, and global consultations, the report outlines how detection tools must evolve to become truly innovative and relevant by meeting diverse linguistic, cultural, and technological contexts. It offers practical guidance for developers, policy actors, and standards bodies to design accountable, transparent, and user-centered detection solutions, and incorporate sociotechnical considerations into future AI standards, procedures and evaluation frameworks. By adopting the TRIED Benchmark, stakeholders can drive innovation, safeguard public trust, strengthen AI literacy, and contribute to a more resilient global information credibility."
2504.21634,"Fairness auditing of AI systems can identify and quantify biases. However, traditional auditing using real-world data raises security and privacy concerns. It exposes auditors to security risks as they become custodians of sensitive information and targets for cyberattacks. Privacy risks arise even without direct breaches, as data analyses can inadvertently expose confidential information. To address these, we propose a framework that leverages differentially private synthetic data to audit the fairness of AI systems. By applying privacy-preserving mechanisms, it generates synthetic data that mirrors the statistical properties of the original dataset while ensuring privacy. This method balances the goal of rigorous fairness auditing and the need for strong privacy protections. Through experiments on real datasets like Adult, COMPAS, and Diabetes, we compare fairness metrics of synthetic and real data. By analyzing the alignment and discrepancies between these metrics, we assess the capacity of synthetic data to preserve the fairness properties of real data. Our results demonstrate the framework's ability to enable meaningful fairness evaluations while safeguarding sensitive information, proving its applicability across critical and sensitive domains."
2504.21848,"The creation of effective governance mechanisms for AI agents requires a deeper understanding of their core properties and how these properties relate to questions surrounding the deployment and operation of agents in the world. This paper provides a characterization of AI agents that focuses on four dimensions: autonomy, efficacy, goal complexity, and generality. We propose different gradations for each dimension, and argue that each dimension raises unique questions about the design, operation, and governance of these systems. Moreover, we draw upon this framework to construct ""agentic profiles"" for different kinds of AI agents. These profiles help to illuminate cross-cutting technical and non-technical governance challenges posed by different classes of AI agents, ranging from narrow task-specific assistants to highly autonomous general-purpose systems. By mapping out key axes of variation and continuity, this framework provides developers, policymakers, and members of the public with the opportunity to develop governance approaches that better align with collective societal goals."
2504.21849,"Governance institutions must respond to societal risks, including those posed by generative AI. This study empirically examines how public trust in institutions and AI technologies, along with perceived risks, shape preferences for AI regulation. Using the nationally representative 2023 Artificial Intelligence, Morality, and Sentience (AIMS) survey, we assess trust in government, AI companies, and AI technologies, as well as public support for regulatory measures such as slowing AI development or outright bans on advanced AI. Our findings reveal broad public support for AI regulation, with risk perception playing a significant role in shaping policy preferences. Individuals with higher trust in government favor regulation, while those with greater trust in AI companies and AI technologies are less inclined to support restrictions. Trust in government and perceived risks significantly predict preferences for both soft (e.g., slowing development) and strong (e.g., banning AI systems) regulatory interventions. These results highlight the importance of public opinion in AI governance. As AI capabilities advance, effective regulation will require balancing public concerns about risks with trust in institutions. This study provides a foundational empirical baseline for policymakers navigating AI governance and underscores the need for further research into public trust, risk perception, and regulatory strategies in the evolving AI landscape."
2505.00049,"As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-centered tasks, assessing their psychological traits is crucial for understanding their social impact and ensuring trustworthy AI alignment. While existing reviews have covered some aspects of related research, several important areas have not been systematically discussed, including detailed discussions of diverse psychological tests, LLM-specific psychological datasets, and the applications of LLMs with psychological traits. To address this gap, we systematically review six key dimensions of applying psychological theories to LLMs: (1) assessment tools; (2) LLM-specific datasets; (3) evaluation metrics (consistency and stability); (4) empirical findings; (5) personality simulation methods; and (6) LLM-based behavior simulation. Our analysis highlights both the strengths and limitations of current methods. While some LLMs exhibit reproducible personality patterns under specific prompting schemes, significant variability remains across tasks and settings. Recognizing methodological challenges such as mismatches between psychological tools and LLMs' capabilities, as well as inconsistencies in evaluation practices, this study aims to propose future directions for developing more interpretable, robust, and generalizable psychological assessment frameworks for LLMs."
2505.00054,"Today's largest technology corporations, especially ones with consumer-facing products such as social media platforms, use a variety of unethical and often outright illegal tactics to maintain their dominance. One tactic that has risen to the level of the public consciousness is the concept of addictive design, evidenced by the fact that excessive social media use has become a salient problem, particularly in the mental and social development of adolescents and young adults. As tech companies have developed more and more sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) models to power their algorithmic recommender systems, they will become more successful at their goal of ensuring addiction to their platforms. This paper explores how online platforms intentionally cultivate addictive user behaviors and the broad societal implications, including on the health and well-being of children and adolescents. It presents the usage of addictive design - including the usage of dark patterns, persuasive design elements, and recommender algorithms - as a tool leveraged by technology corporations to maintain their dominance. Lastly, it describes the challenge of content moderation to address the problem and gives an overview of solutions at the policy level to counteract addictive design."
2505.001,"Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly entering computer science education, yet its effects on student learning, skill development, and perceptions remain underexplored. Concerns about overreliance coexist with a gap in research on structured scaffolding to guide tool use in formal courses. This study examines the impact of a dedicated ""AI-Lab"" intervention -- emphasizing guided scaffolding and mindful engagement -- on undergraduate students in Data Structures and Algorithms, Competitive Programming, and first-year engineering courses at Purdue University.Over three semesters, we integrated AI-Lab modules into four mandatory and elective courses, yielding 831 matched pre- and post-intervention survey responses, alongside focus group discussions. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed quantitative shifts in usage patterns and attitudes as well as qualitative narratives of student experiences.While the overall frequency of GenAI usage for homework or programming projects remained largely stable, we observed large effect sizes in comfort and openness across conceptual, debugging, and homework problems. Notably, usage patterns for debugging also shifted statistically significantly, reflecting students' more mindful and deliberate approach. Focus group discussions corroborated these results, suggesting that the intervention ""bridged the gap"" between naive GenAI usage and more nuanced, reflective integration of AI tools into coursework, ultimately heightening students' awareness of their own skill development.These findings suggest that structured, scaffolded interventions can enable students to harness GenAI's benefits without undermining essential competencies. We offer evidence-based recommendations for educators seeking to integrate GenAI responsibly into computing curricula and identify avenues for future research on GenAI-supported pedagogy."
2505.00195,"Given that data-dependent algorithmic systems have become impactful in more domains of life, the need for individuals to promote their own interests and hold algorithms accountable has grown. To have meaningful influence, individuals must band together to engage in collective action. Groups that engage in such algorithmic collective action are likely to vary in size, membership characteristics, and crucially, objectives. In this work, we introduce a first of a kind framework for studying collective action with two or more collectives that strategically behave to manipulate data-driven systems. With more than one collective acting on a system, unexpected interactions may occur. We use this framework to conduct experiments with language model-based classifiers and recommender systems where two collectives each attempt to achieve their own individual objectives. We examine how differing objectives, strategies, sizes, and homogeneity can impact a collective's efficacy. We find that the unintentional interactions between collectives can be quite significant; a collective acting in isolation may be able to achieve their objective (e.g., improve classification outcomes for themselves or promote a particular item), but when a second collective acts simultaneously, the efficacy of the first group drops by as much as $75\%$. We find that, in the recommender system context, neither fully heterogeneous nor fully homogeneous collectives stand out as most efficacious and that heterogeneity's impact is secondary compared to collective size. Our results signal the need for more transparency in both the underlying algorithmic models and the different behaviors individuals or collectives may take on these systems. This approach also allows collectives to hold algorithmic system developers accountable and provides a framework for people to actively use their own data to promote their own interests."
2505.00264,"This paper presents an investigation into the integration of virtual reality (VR) tours in online English lessons tailored for adult learners. The study utilised a design-based research approach to evaluate the effectiveness of VR tours in this context. It specifically examined the responses of adult learners to this instructional strategy by collecting data through surveys, observation notes and interviews with four learners in Japan and five learners in France, most of whom completed 10 lessons over 4 months. The research findings highlight the effectiveness of VR tours in enhancing learner motivation. Additionally, they demonstrate that perceived learning outcomes are influenced not only by the immersive experience of spatial presence but also by the novelty of technological and scenery-related aspects within the VR environment, as well as factors related to lesson design and individual learner characteristics."
2505.00496,"Are nuclear weapons useful for coercion, and, if so, what factors increase the credibility and effectiveness of nuclear threats? While prominent scholars like Thomas Schelling argue that nuclear brinkmanship, or the manipulation of nuclear risk, can effectively coerce adversaries, others contend nuclear weapons are not effective tools of coercion, especially coercion designed to achieve offensive and revisionist objectives. Simultaneously, there is broad debate about the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into military systems, especially nuclear command and control. We develop a theoretical argument that explicit nuclear threats implemented with automated nuclear launch systems are potentially more credible compared to ambiguous nuclear threats or explicit nuclear threats implemented via non-automated means. By reducing human control over nuclear use, leaders can more effectively tie their hands and thus signal resolve. While automated nuclear weapons launch systems may seem like something out of science fiction, the Soviet Union deployed such a system during the Cold War and the technology necessary to automate the use of force has developed considerably in recent years due to advances in AI. Preregistered survey experiments on an elite sample of United Kingdom Members of Parliament and two public samples of UK citizens provide support for these expectations, showing that, in a limited set of circumstances, nuclear threats backed by AI integration have credibility advantages, no matter how dangerous they may be. Our findings contribute to the literatures on coercive bargaining, weapons of mass destruction, and emerging technology."
2505.00616,"As artificial intelligence systems grow more capable and autonomous, frontier AI development poses potential systemic risks that could affect society at a massive scale. Current practices at many AI labs developing these systems lack sufficient transparency around safety measures, testing procedures, and governance structures. This opacity makes it challenging to verify safety claims or establish appropriate liability when harm occurs. Drawing on liability frameworks from nuclear energy, aviation software, cybersecurity, and healthcare, we propose a comprehensive approach to safety documentation and accountability in frontier AI development."
2505.00853,"This study establishes a novel framework for systematically evaluating the moral reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as they increasingly integrate into critical societal domains. Current assessment methodologies lack the precision needed to evaluate nuanced ethical decision-making in AI systems, creating significant accountability gaps. Our framework addresses this challenge by quantifying alignment with human ethical standards through three dimensions: foundational moral principles, reasoning robustness, and value consistency across diverse scenarios. This approach enables precise identification of ethical strengths and weaknesses in LLMs, facilitating targeted improvements and stronger alignment with societal values. To promote transparency and collaborative advancement in ethical AI development, we are publicly releasing both our benchmark datasets and evaluation codebase atthis https URLThe-Responsible-AI-Initiative/LLM_Ethics_Benchmark.git."
2505.00965,"Defining fairness in AI remains a persistent challenge, largely due to its deeply context-dependent nature and the lack of a universal definition. While numerous mathematical formulations of fairness exist, they sometimes conflict with one another and diverge from social, economic, and legal understandings of justice. Traditional quantitative definitions primarily focus on statistical comparisons, but they often fail to simultaneously satisfy multiple fairness constraints. Drawing on philosophical theories (Rawls' Difference Principle and Dworkin's theory of equality) and empirical evidence supporting affirmative action, we argue that fairness sometimes necessitates deliberate, context-aware preferential treatment of historically marginalized groups. Rather than viewing bias solely as a flaw to eliminate, we propose a framework that embraces corrective, intentional biases to promote genuine equality of opportunity. Our approach involves identifying unfairness, recognizing protected groups/individuals, applying corrective strategies, measuring impact, and iterating improvements. By bridging mathematical precision with ethical and contextual considerations, we advocate for an AI fairness paradigm that goes beyond neutrality to actively advance social justice."
2505.01085,"The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in public administration is expanding rapidly, moving from automating routine tasks to deploying generative and agentic systems that autonomously act on goals. While AI promises greater efficiency and responsiveness, its integration into government functions raises concerns about fairness, transparency, and accountability. This article applies principal-agent theory (PAT) to conceptualize AI adoption as a special case of delegation, highlighting three core tensions: assessability (can decisions be understood?), dependency (can the delegation be reversed?), and contestability (can decisions be challenged?). These structural challenges may lead to a ""failure-by-success"" dynamic, where early functional gains obscure long-term risks to democratic legitimacy. To test this framework, we conducted a pre-registered factorial survey experiment across tax, welfare, and law enforcement domains. Our findings show that although efficiency gains initially bolster trust, they simultaneously reduce citizens' perceived control. When the structural risks come to the foreground, institutional trust and perceived control both drop sharply, suggesting that hidden costs of AI adoption significantly shape public attitudes. The study demonstrates that PAT offers a powerful lens for understanding the institutional and political implications of AI in government, emphasizing the need for policymakers to address delegation risks transparently to maintain public trust."
2505.01106,"Generative AI (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT allow users, including school students without prior AI expertise, to explore and address a wide range of tasks. Surveys show that most students aged eleven and older already use these tools for school-related activities. However, little is known about how they actually use GenAI and how it impacts their learning.This study addresses this gap by examining middle school students ability to ask effective questions and critically evaluate ChatGPT responses, two essential skills for active learning and productive interactions with GenAI. 63 students aged 14 to 15 were tasked with solving science investigation problems using ChatGPT. We analyzed their interactions with the model, as well as their resulting learning outcomes.Findings show that students often over-relied on ChatGPT in both the question-asking and answer-evaluation phases. Many struggled to use clear questions aligned with task goals and had difficulty judging the quality of responses or knowing when to seek clarification. As a result, their learning performance remained moderate: their explanations of the scientific concepts tended to be vague, incomplete, or inaccurate, even after unrestricted use of ChatGPT. This pattern held even in domains where students reported strong prior knowledge.Furthermore, students self-reported understanding and use of ChatGPT were negatively associated with their ability to select effective questions and evaluate responses, suggesting misconceptions about the tool and its limitations. In contrast, higher metacognitive skills were positively linked to better QA-related skills.These findings underscore the need for educational interventions that promote AI literacy and foster question-asking strategies to support effective learning with GenAI."
2505.01122,"To facilitate accountability and transparency, the Digital Services Act (DSA) sets up a process through which Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) need to grant vetted researchers access to their internal data (Article 40(4)). Operationalising such access is challenging for at least two reasons. First, data access is only available for research on systemic risks affecting European citizens, a concept with high levels of legal uncertainty. Second, data access suffers from an inherent standoff problem. Researchers need to request specific data but are not in a position to know all internal data processed by VLOPs, who, in turn, expect data specificity for potential access. In light of these limitations, data access under the DSA remains a mystery. To contribute to the discussion of how Article 40 can be interpreted and applied, we provide a concrete illustration of what data access can look like in a real-world systemic risk case study. We focus on the 2024 Romanian presidential election interference incident, the first event of its kind to trigger systemic risk investigations by the European Commission. During the elections, one candidate is said to have benefited from TikTok algorithmic amplification through a complex dis- and misinformation campaign. By analysing this incident, we can comprehend election-related systemic risk to explore practical research tasks and compare necessary data with available TikTok data. In particular, we make two contributions: (i) we combine insights from law, computer science and platform governance to shed light on the complexities of studying systemic risks in the context of election interference, focusing on two relevant factors: platform manipulation and hidden advertising; and (ii) we provide practical insights into various categories of available data for the study of TikTok, based on platform documentation, data donations and the Research API."
2505.0115,"This paper presents a methodological framework for using generative AI in educational survey research. We explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate adaptive, context-aware survey questions and introduce the Synthetic Question-Response Analysis (SQRA) framework, which enables iterative testing and refinement of AI-generated prompts prior to deployment with human participants. Guided by Activity Theory, we analyze how AI tools mediate participant engagement and learning, and we examine ethical issues such as bias, privacy, and transparency. Through sentiment, lexical, and structural analyses of both AI-to-AI and AI-to-human survey interactions, we evaluate the alignment and effectiveness of these questions. Our findings highlight the promise and limitations of AI-driven survey instruments, emphasizing the need for robust prompt engineering and validation to support trustworthy, scalable, and contextually relevant data collection in engineering education."
2505.01355,"The rapid technological advancements made the concept of digital immortality less fantastical and more plausible, sparking academic and industrial interest. Existing literature mainly discusses philosophical and societal aspects, lacking specific empirical observation. To address this gap, we conducted a study among Chinese youth to gauge their acceptance of digital immortality. Using cluster analysis, we classified participants into three groups: ""geeks,"" ""video game players,"" and ""laggards"" based on their media usage. Those most receptive to digital immortality, termed ""geeks"" tend to be male, with higher income levels, openness, conscientiousness, extensive engagement with emerging media technology, and surprisingly, more adhering to Buddhism and Daoism. Overall, this study examined media usage patterns and youth perspectives on digital immortality, shedding light on technology's role in shaping views on life and death. It highlights the importance of further research on the profound implications of digital immortality in the context of contemporary society."
2505.01643,"Safety frameworks have emerged as a best practice for managing risks from frontier artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, it may be difficult for stakeholders to know if companies are adhering to their frameworks. This paper explores a potential solution: third-party compliance reviews. During a third-party compliance review, an independent external party assesses whether a frontier AI company is complying with its safety framework. First, we discuss the main benefits and challenges of such reviews. On the one hand, they can increase compliance with safety frameworks and provide assurance to internal and external stakeholders. On the other hand, they can create information security risks, impose additional cost burdens, and cause reputational damage, but these challenges can be partially mitigated by drawing on best practices from other industries. Next, we answer practical questions about third-party compliance reviews, namely: (1) Who could conduct the review? (2) What information sources could the reviewer consider? (3) How could compliance with the safety framework be assessed? (4) What information about the review could be disclosed externally? (5) How could the findings guide development and deployment actions? (6) When could the reviews be conducted? For each question, we evaluate a set of plausible options. Finally, we suggest ""minimalist"", ""more ambitious"", and ""comprehensive"" approaches for each question that a frontier AI company could adopt."
2505.0183,"The global surge in social inequalities is one of the most pressing issues of our times. The spatial expression of social inequalities at city scale gives rise to urban segregation, a common phenomenon across different local and cultural contexts. The increasing popularity of Big Data and computational models has inspired a growing number of computational social science studies that analyze, evaluate, and issue policy recommendations for urban segregation. Today's wealth in information and computational power could inform urban planning for equity. However, as we show here, segregation research is epistemologically interdependent with prevalent economic theories which overfocus on individual responsibility while neglecting systemic processes. This individualistic bias is also engrained in computational models of urban segregation. Through several contemporary examples of how Big Data -- and the assumptions underlying its usage -- influence (de)segregation patterns and policies, our essay tells a cautionary tale. We highlight how a lack of consideration for data ethics can lead to the creation of computational models that have a real-life, further marginalizing impact on disadvantaged groups. With this essay, our aim is to develop a better discernment of the pitfalls and potentials of computational approaches to urban segregation, thereby fostering a conscious focus on systemic thinking about urban inequalities. We suggest setting an agenda for research and collective action that is directed at demobilizing individualistic bias, informing our thinking about urban segregation, but also more broadly our efforts to create sustainable cities and communities."
2505.01879,"Today's ethics of privacy is largely dedicated to defending personal information from big data technologies. This essay goes in the other direction. It considers the struggle to be lost, and explores two strategies for living after privacy is gone. First, total exposure embraces privacy's decline, and then contributes to the process with transparency. All personal information is shared without reservation. The resulting ethics is explored through a big data version of Robert Nozick's Experience Machine thought experiment. Second, transient existence responds to privacy's loss by ceaselessly generating new personal identities, which translates into constantly producing temporarily unviolated private information. The ethics is explored through Gilles Deleuze's metaphysics of difference applied in linguistic terms to the formation of the self. Comparing the exposure and transience alternatives leads to the conclusion that today's big data reality splits the traditional ethical link between authenticity and freedom. Exposure provides authenticity, but negates human freedom. Transience provides freedom, but disdains authenticity."
2505.02174,"Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states increasingly adopt Artificial Intelligence (AI) to drive economic diversification and enhance services. This paper investigates the evolving AI governance landscape across the six GCC nations, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, and Kuwait, through an in-depth document analysis of six National AI Strategies (NASs) and related policies published between 2018 and 2024. Drawing on the Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) and Multi-stakeholder Governance theory, the findings highlight a ""soft regulation"" approach that emphasizes national strategies and ethical principles rather than binding regulations. While this approach fosters rapid innovation, it also raises concerns regarding the enforceability of ethical standards, potential ethicswashing, and alignment with global frameworks, particularly the EU AI Act. Common challenges include data limitations, talent shortages, and reconciling AI applications with cultural values. Despite these hurdles, GCC governments aspire to leverage AI for robust economic growth, better public services, and regional leadership in responsible AI. The analysis suggests that strengthening legal mechanisms, enhancing stakeholder engagement, and aligning policies with local contexts and international norms will be essential for harnessing AI's transformative potential in the GCC."
2505.02198,"The use of chatbots equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) in educational settings has increased in recent years, showing potential to support teaching and learning. However, the adoption of these technologies has raised concerns about their impact on academic integrity, students' ability to problem-solve independently, and potential underlying biases. To better understand students' perspectives and experiences with these tools, a survey was conducted at a large public university in the United States. Through thematic analysis, 262 undergraduate students' responses regarding their perceived benefits and risks of AI chatbots in education were identified and categorized into themes.The results discuss several benefits identified by the students, with feedback and study support, instruction capabilities, and access to information being the most cited. Their primary concerns included risks to academic integrity, accuracy of information, loss of critical thinking skills, the potential development of overreliance, and ethical considerations such as data privacy, system bias, environmental impact, and preservation of human elements in education.While student perceptions align with previously discussed benefits and risks of AI in education, they show heightened concerns about distinguishing between human and AI generated work - particularly in cases where authentic work is flagged as AI-generated. To address students' concerns, institutions can establish clear policies regarding AI use and develop curriculum around AI literacy. With these in place, practitioners can effectively develop and implement educational systems that leverage AI's potential in areas such as immediate feedback and personalized learning support. This approach can enhance the quality of students' educational experiences while preserving the integrity of the learning process with AI."
2505.02313,"The field of AI safety seeks to prevent or reduce the harms caused by AI systems. A simple and appealing account of what is distinctive of AI safety as a field holds that this feature is constitutive: a research project falls within the purview of AI safety just in case it aims to prevent or reduce the harms caused by AI systems. Call this appealingly simple account The Safety Conception of AI safety. Despite its simplicity and appeal, we argue that The Safety Conception is in tension with at least two trends in the ways AI safety researchers and organizations think and talk about AI safety: first, a tendency to characterize the goal of AI safety research in terms of catastrophic risks from future systems; second, the increasingly popular idea that AI safety can be thought of as a branch of safety engineering. Adopting the methodology of conceptual engineering, we argue that these trends are unfortunate: when we consider what concept of AI safety it would be best to have, there are compelling reasons to think that The Safety Conception is the answer. Descriptively, The Safety Conception allows us to see how work on topics that have historically been treated as central to the field of AI safety is continuous with work on topics that have historically been treated as more marginal, like bias, misinformation, and privacy. Normatively, taking The Safety Conception seriously means approaching all efforts to prevent or mitigate harms from AI systems based on their merits rather than drawing arbitrary distinctions between them."
2505.02324,"Curricular analytics (CA) -- systematic analysis of curricula data to inform program and course refinement -- becomes an increasingly valuable tool to help institutions align academic offerings with evolving societal and economic demands. Large language models (LLMs) are promising for handling large-scale, unstructured curriculum data, but it remains uncertain how reliably LLMs can perform CA tasks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate four text alignment strategies based on LLMs or traditional NLP methods for skill extraction, a core task in CA. Using a stratified sample of 400 curriculum documents of different types and a human-LLM collaborative evaluation framework, we find that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is the top-performing strategy across all types of curriculum documents, while zero-shot prompting performs worse than traditional NLP methods in most cases. Our findings highlight the promise of LLMs in analyzing brief and abstract curriculum documents, but also reveal that their performance can vary significantly depending on model selection and prompting strategies. This underscores the importance of carefully evaluating the performance of LLM-based strategies before large-scale deployment."
2505.02329,"Algorithmic management (AM)'s impact on worker well-being has led to calls for regulation. However, little is known about the effectiveness and challenges in real-world AM regulation across the regulatory process -- rule operationalization, software use, and enforcement. Our multi-stakeholder study addresses this gap within workplace scheduling, one of the few AM domains with implemented regulations. We interviewed 38 stakeholders across the regulatory process: regulators, defense attorneys, worker advocates, managers, and workers. Our findings suggest that the efficacy of AM regulation is influenced by: (i) institutional constraints that challenge efforts to encode law into AM software, (ii) on-the-ground use of AM software that shapes its ability to facilitate compliance, (iii) mismatches between software and regulatory contexts that hinder enforcement, and (iv) unique concerns that software introduces when used to regulate AM. These findings underscore the importance of a sociotechnical approach to AM regulation, which considers organizational and collaborative contexts alongside the inherent attributes of software. We offer future research directions and implications for technology policy and design."
2505.02519,"This paper explores the interplay of AI language technologies, sign language interpreting, and linguistic access, highlighting the complex interdependencies shaping access frameworks and the tradeoffs these technologies bring. While AI tools promise innovation, they also perpetuate biases, reinforce technoableism, and deepen inequalities through systemic and design flaws. The historical and contemporary privileging of sign language interpreting as the dominant access model, and the broader inclusion ideologies it reflects, shape AIs development and deployment, often sidelining deaf languaging practices and introducing new forms of linguistic subordination to technology. Drawing on Deaf Studies, Sign Language Interpreting Studies, and crip technoscience, this paper critiques the framing of AI as a substitute for interpreters and examines its implications for access hierarchies. It calls for deaf-led approaches to foster AI systems that remain equitable, inclusive, and trustworthy, supporting rather than undermining linguistic autonomy and contributing to deaf aligned futures."
2505.02749,"The AI/HCI and legal communities have developed largely independent conceptualizations of fairness. This conceptual difference hinders the potential incorporation of technical fairness criteria (e.g., procedural, group, and individual fairness) into sustainable policies and designs, particularly for high-stakes applications like recidivism risk assessment. To foster common ground, we conduct legal research to identify if and how technical AI conceptualizations of fairness surface in primary legal sources. We find that while major technical fairness criteria can be linked to constitutional mandates such as ``Due Process'' and ``Equal Protection'' thanks to judicial interpretation, several challenges arise when operationalizing them into concrete statutes/regulations. These policies often adopt procedural and group fairness but ignore the major technical criterion of individual fairness. Regarding procedural fairness, judicial ``scrutiny'' categories are relevant but may not fully capture how courts scrutinize the use of demographic features in potentially discriminatory government tools like RRA. Furthermore, some policies contradict each other on whether to apply procedural fairness to certain demographic features. Thus, we propose a new framework, integrating U.S. demographics-related legal scrutiny concepts and technical fairness criteria, and contextualize it in three other major AI-adopting jurisdictions (EU, China, and India)."
2505.0277,"The rise of social media and AI tools has reshaped how students engage with learning, process information, and build trust in educational content. This generation prefers short, visual materials and fast feedback but often struggles with focus, critical thinking, and deep learning. Educators face the challenge of adapting teaching methods to these habits without lowering academic standards. This study presents a blended learning redesign of a first-year technical course at a Dutch university. Key features included short whiteboard videos before class, hands-on teamwork during class, narrative-style handouts to reinforce learning, in-class draft assignments without AI, and weekly anonymous feedback to adjust in real time. The results were promising: attendance increased by nearly 50%, and none of the regularly attending students failed the exam. Students found the videos useful but emphasized that in-person sessions were essential for understanding the material. While some resisted the shift in expectations, most appreciated the structure, clarity, and opportunities for active learning. This case suggests that combining digital familiarity with clear expectations and active support can help meet students where they are, while still challenging them to grow."
2505.02791,"Social scoring is one of the AI practices banned by the AI Act. This ban is explicitly inspired by China, which in 2014 announced its intention to set up a large-scale government project - the Social Credit System - aiming to rate every Chinese citizen according to their good behaviour, using digital technologies and AI. But in Europe, individuals are also scored by public and private bodies in a variety of contexts, such as assessing creditworthiness, monitoring employee productivity, detecting social fraud or terrorist risks, and so on. However, the AI Act does not intend to prohibit these types of scoring, as they would qualify as 'high-risk AI systems', which are authorised while subject to various requirements. One might therefore think that the ban on social scoring will have no practical effect on the scoring practices already in use in Europe, and that it is merely a vague safeguard in case an authoritarian power is tempted to set up such a system on European territory. Contrary to this view, this article argues that the ban has been drafted in a way that is flexible and therefore likely to make it a useful tool, similar and complementary to Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation, to protect individuals against certain forms of disproportionate use of AI-based scoring."
2505.02846,"In policy debates concerning the governance and regulation of Artificial Intelligence (AI), both the Precautionary Principle (PP) and the Innovation Principle (IP) are advocated by their respective interest groups. Do these principles offer wholly incompatible and contradictory guidance? Does one necessarily negate the other? I argue here that provided attention is restricted to weak-form PP and IP, the answer to both of these questions is ""No."" The essence of these weak formulations is the requirement to fully account for type-I error costs arising from erroneously preventing the innovation's diffusion through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory red-lighting) as well as the type-II error costs arising from erroneously allowing the innovation to diffuse through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory green-lighting). Within the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model developed here, weak-PP red-light (weak-IP green-light) determinations are optimal for sufficiently small (large) ratios of expected type-I to type-II error costs. For intermediate expected cost ratios, an amber-light 'wait-and-monitor' policy is optimal. Regulatory sandbox instruments allow AI testing and experimentation to take place within a structured environment of limited duration and societal scale, whereby the expected cost ratio falls within the 'wait-and-monitor' range. Through sandboxing regulators and innovating firms learn more about the expected cost ratio, and what respective adaptations -- of regulation, of technical solution, of business model, or combination thereof, if any -- are needed to keep the ratio out of the weak-PP red-light zone. Nevertheless AI foundation models are ill-suited for regulatory sandboxing as their general-purpose nature precludes credible identification of misclassification costs."
2505.02848,"The wide exploration of large language models (LLMs) raises the awareness of alignment between healthcare stakeholder preferences and model outputs. This alignment becomes a crucial foundation to empower the healthcare workflow effectively, safely, and responsibly. Yet the varying behaviors of LLMs may not always match with healthcare stakeholders' knowledge, demands, and values. To enable a human-AI alignment, healthcare stakeholders will need to perform essential roles in guiding and enhancing the performance of LLMs. Human professionals must participate in the entire life cycle of adopting LLM in healthcare, including training data curation, model training, and inference. In this review, we discuss the approaches, tools, and applications of alignments between healthcare stakeholders and LLMs. We demonstrate that LLMs can better follow human values by properly enhancing healthcare knowledge integration, task understanding, and human guidance. We provide outlooks on enhancing the alignment between humans and LLMs to build trustworthy real-world healthcare applications."
2505.02849,"Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have reignited interest in their impact on Computer-based Learning (CBL). AI-driven tools like ChatGPT and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have enhanced learning experiences through personalisation and flexibility. ITSs can adapt to individual learning needs and provide customised feedback based on a student's performance, cognitive state, and learning path. Despite these advances, challenges remain in accommodating diverse learning styles and delivering real-time, context-aware feedback. Our research aims to address these gaps by integrating skill-aligned feedback via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) into prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs) and developing an application to enhance learning through personalised tutoring in a computer science programming context. The pilot study evaluated a proposed system using three quantitative metrics: readability score, response time, and feedback depth, across three programming tasks of varying complexity. The system successfully sorted simulated students into three skill-level categories and provided context-aware feedback. This targeted approach demonstrated better effectiveness and adaptability compared to general methods."
2505.02853,"Human education transcends mere knowledge transfer, it relies on co-adaptation dynamics -- the mutual adjustment of teaching and learning strategies between agents. Despite its centrality, computational models of co-adaptive teacher-student interactions (T-SI) remain underdeveloped. We argue that this gap impedes Educational Science in testing and scaling contextual insights across diverse settings, and limits the potential of Machine Learning systems, which struggle to emulate and adaptively support human learning processes. To address this, we present a computational T-SI model that integrates contextual insights on human education into a testable framework. We use the model to evaluate diverse T-SI strategies in a realistic synthetic classroom setting, simulating student groups with unequal access to sensory information. Results show that strategies incorporating co-adaptation principles (e.g., bidirectional agency) outperform unilateral approaches (i.e., where only the teacher or the student is active), improving the learning outcomes for all learning types. Beyond the testing and scaling of context-dependent educational insights, our model enables hypothesis generation in controlled yet adaptable environments. This work bridges non-computational theories of human education with scalable, inclusive AI in Education systems, providing a foundation for equitable technologies that dynamically adapt to learner needs."
2505.02856,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies continue to evolve, the gap between academic AI education and real-world industry challenges remains an important area of investigation. This study provides preliminary insights into challenges AI professionals encounter in both academia and industry, based on semi-structured interviews with 14 AI experts - eight from industry and six from academia. We identify key challenges related to data quality and availability, model scalability, practical constraints, user behavior, and explainability. While both groups experience data and model adaptation difficulties, industry professionals more frequently highlight deployment constraints, resource limitations, and external dependencies, whereas academics emphasize theoretical adaptation and standardization issues. These exploratory findings suggest that AI curricula could better integrate real-world complexities, software engineering principles, and interdisciplinary learning, while recognizing the broader educational goals of building foundational and ethical reasoning skills."
2505.02857,"Context: Gender inequality is a widely discussed issue across various sectors, including Information Technology and Communication (ICT). In Brazil, women represent less than 18% of ICT students in higher education. Prior studies highlight gender-related barriers that discourage women from staying in ICT. However, they provide limited insights into their perceptions as undergraduate students and the factors influencing their participation and confidence. Goal: This study explores the perceptions of women undergraduate students in ICT regarding gender inequality. Method: A survey of 402 women from 18 Brazilian states enrolled in ICT courses was conducted using a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results: Women students reported experiencing discriminatory practices from peers and professors, both inside and outside the classroom. Gender stereotypes were found to undermine their self-confidence and self-esteem, occasionally leading to course discontinuation. Conclusions: Factors such as lack of representation, inappropriate jokes, isolation, mistrust, and difficulty being heard contribute to harmful outcomes, including reduced participation and reluctance to take leadership roles. Addressing these issues is essential to creating a safe and respectful learning environment for all students."
2505.02863,"The use of generative AI (GAI) among university students is rapidly increasing, yet empirical research on students' GAI use and the factors influencing it remains limited. To address this gap, we surveyed 363 undergraduate and graduate students in the United States, examining their GAI usage and how it relates to demographic variables and personality traits based on the Big Five model (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability, and intellect/imagination). Our findings reveal: (a) Students in higher academic years are more inclined to use GAI and prefer it over traditional resources. (b) Non-native English speakers use and adopt GAI more readily than native speakers. (c) Compared to White, Asian students report higher GAI usage, perceive greater academic benefits, and express a stronger preference for it. Similarly, Black students report a more positive impact of GAI on their academic performance. Personality traits also play a significant role in shaping perceptions and usage of GAI. After controlling demographic factors, we found that personality still significantly predicts GAI use and attitudes: (a) Students with higher conscientiousness use GAI less. (b) Students who are higher in agreeableness perceive a less positive impact of GAI on academic performance and express more ethical concerns about using it for academic work. (c) Students with higher emotional stability report a more positive impact of GAI on learning and fewer concerns about its academic use. (d) Students with higher extraversion show a stronger preference for GAI over traditional resources. (e) Students with higher intellect/imagination tend to prefer traditional resources. These insights highlight the need for universities to provide personalized guidance to ensure students use GAI effectively, ethically, and equitably in their academic pursuits."
2505.02938,"Understanding urban form is crucial for sustainable urban planning and enhancing quality of life. This study presents a data-driven framework to systematically identify and compare urban typologies across geographically and culturally distinct cities. Using open-source geospatial data from OpenStreetMap, we extracted multidimensional features related to topography, multimodality, green spaces, and points of interest for the cities of Lausanne, Switzerland, and Philadelphia, USA. A grid-based approach was used to divide each city into Basic Spatial Units (BSU), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) were applied to cluster BSUs based on their urban characteristics. The results reveal coherent and interpretable urban typologies within each city, with some cluster types emerging across both cities despite their differences in scale, density, and cultural context. Comparative analysis showed that adapting the grid size to each city's morphology improves the detection of shared typologies. Simplified clustering based solely on network degree centrality further demonstrated that meaningful structural patterns can be captured even with minimal feature sets. Our findings suggest the presence of functionally convergent urban forms across continents and highlight the importance of spatial scale in cross-city comparisons. The framework offers a scalable and transferable approach for urban analysis, providing valuable insights for planners and policymakers aiming to enhance walkability, accessibility, and well-being. Limitations related to data completeness and feature selection are discussed, and directions for future work -- including the integration of additional data sources and human-centered validation -- are proposed."
2505.02945,"The origins of economic behavior remain unresolved-not only in the social sciences but also in AI, where dominant theories often rely on predefined incentives or institutional assumptions. Contrary to the longstanding myth of barter as the foundation of exchange, converging evidence from early human societies suggests that reciprocity-not barter-was the foundational economic logic, enabling communities to sustain exchange and social cohesion long before formal markets emerged. Yet despite its centrality, reciprocity lacks a simulateable and cognitively grounded account. Here, we introduce a minimal behavioral framework based on three empirically supported cognitive primitives-individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost--return sensitivity-that enable agents to participate in and sustain reciprocal exchange, laying the foundation for scalable economic behavior. These mechanisms scaffold the emergence of cooperation, proto-economic exchange, and institutional structure from the bottom up. By bridging insights from primatology, developmental psychology, and economic anthropology, this framework offers a unified substrate for modeling trust, coordination, and economic behavior in both human and artificial systems. For an interactive visualization of the framework, see:this https URL"
2505.02975,"AI assistants are increasingly integrated into older adults' daily lives, offering new opportunities for social support and accessibility while raising important questions about privacy, autonomy, and trust. As these systems become embedded in caregiving and social networks, older adults must navigate trade-offs between usability, data privacy, and personal agency across different interaction contexts. Although prior work has explored AI assistants' potential benefits, further research is needed to understand how perceived usefulness and risk shape adoption and engagement. This paper examines these dynamics and advocates for participatory design approaches that position older adults as active decision makers in shaping AI assistant functionality. By advancing a framework for privacy-aware, user-centered AI design, this work contributes to ongoing discussions on developing ethical and transparent AI systems that enhance well-being without compromising user control."
2505.03163,"AI-driven education, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to address learning disparities in rural K-12 schools. However, research on AI adoption in rural India remains limited, with existing studies focusing primarily on urban settings. This study examines the perceptions of volunteer teachers on AI integration in rural education, identifying key challenges and opportunities. Through semi-structured interviews with 23 volunteer educators in Rajasthan and Delhi, we conducted a thematic analysis to explore infrastructure constraints, teacher preparedness, and digital literacy gaps. Findings indicate that while LLMs could enhance personalized learning and reduce teacher workload, barriers such as poor connectivity, lack of AI training, and parental skepticism hinder adoption. Despite concerns over over-reliance and ethical risks, volunteers emphasize that AI should be seen as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for traditional teaching. Given the potential benefits, LLM-based tutors merit further exploration in rural classrooms, with structured implementation and localized adaptations to ensure accessibility and equity."
2505.03513,"This paper explores the implications of universities' rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) for studying, teaching, and research by analyzing the logics underpinning their representation space. It argues that by uncritically adopting LLMs, the University surrenders its autonomy to a field of heteronomy, that of generative AI, whose norms are not democratically shaped. Unlike earlier forms of rule-based AI, which sought to exclude human judgment and interpretation, generative AI's new normative rationality is explicitly based on the automation of moral judgment, valuation, and interpretation. By integrating LLMs into pedagogical and research contexts before establishing a critical framework for their use, the University subjects itself to being governed by contingent, ever-evolving, and domain-non-specific norms that structure the model's virtual representation space and thus everything it generates."
2505.03593,"This paper aims to bring together the disciplines of social science (SS) and computer science (CS) in the design and implementation of a novel multidisciplinary framework for systematic, transparent, ethically-informed, and bias-aware investigation of socio-technical issues. For this, various analysis approaches from social science and machine learning (ML) were applied in a structured sequence to arrive at an original methodology of identifying and quantifying objects of inquiry. A core feature of this framework is that it highlights where bias occurs and suggests possible steps to mitigate it. This is to improve the robustness, reliability, and explainability of the framework and its results. Such an approach also ensures that the investigation of socio-technical issues is transparent about its own limitations and potential sources of bias. To test our framework, we utilised it in the multidisciplinary investigation of the online harms encountered by minoritised ethnic (ME) communities when accessing and using digitalised social housing services in the UK. We draw our findings from 100 interviews with ME individuals in four cities across the UK to understand ME vulnerabilities when accessing and using digitalised social housing services. In our framework, a sub-sample of interviews focusing on ME individuals residing in social housing units were inductively coded. This resulted in the identification of the topics of discrimination, digital poverty, lack of digital literacy, and lack of English proficiency as key vulnerabilities of ME communities. Further ML techniques such as Topic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis were used within our framework where we found that Black African communities are more likely to experience these vulnerabilities in the access, use and outcome of digitalised social housing services."
2505.03601,"A central requirement of the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) is that online platforms undergo internal and external audits. A key component of these audits is the assessment of systemic risks, including the dissemination of illegal content, threats to fundamental rights, impacts on democratic processes, and gender-based violence. The DSA Delegated Regulation outlines how such audits should be conducted, setting expectations for both platforms and auditors. This article evaluates the strengths and limitations of different qualitative and quantitative methods for auditing these systemic risks and proposes a mixed-method approach for DSA compliance. We argue that content sampling, combined with legal and empirical analysis, offers a viable method for risk-specific audits. First, we examine relevant legal provisions on sample selection for audit purposes. We then assess sampling techniques and methods suitable for detecting systemic risks, focusing on how representativeness can be understood across disciplines. Finally, we review initial systemic risk assessment reports submitted by platforms, analyzing their testing and sampling methodologies. By proposing a structured, mixed-method approach tailored to specific risk categories and platform characteristics, this article addresses the challenge of evidence-based audits under the DSA. Our contribution emphasizes the need for adaptable, context-sensitive auditing strategies and adds to the emerging field of DSA compliance research."
2505.03842,"Satellite imagery is increasingly used to complement traditional data collection approaches such as surveys and censuses across scientific disciplines. However, we ask: Do all places on earth benefit equally from this new wealth of information? In this study, we investigate coverage bias of major satellite constellations that provide optical satellite imagery with a ground sampling distance below 10 meters, evaluating both the future on-demand tasking opportunities as well as the availability of historic images across the globe. Specifically, forward-looking, we estimate how often different places are revisited during a window of 30 days based on the satellites' orbital paths, thus investigating potential coverage biases caused by physical factors. We find that locations farther away from the equator are generally revisited more frequently by the constellations under study. Backward-looking, we show that historic satellite image availability -- based on metadata collected from major satellite imagery providers -- is influenced by socio-economic factors on the ground: less developed, less populated places have less satellite images available. Furthermore, in three small case studies on recent conflict regions in this world, namely Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, we show that also geopolitical events play an important role in satellite image availability, hinting at underlying business model decisions. These insights lay bare that the digital dividend yielded by satellite imagery is not equally distributed across our planet."
2505.03859,"Advances in multimodal machine learning have made text-to-image (T2I) models increasingly accessible and popular. However, T2I models introduce risks such as the generation of non-consensual depictions of identifiable individuals, otherwise known as deepfakes. This paper presents an empirical study exploring the accessibility of deepfake model variants online. Through a metadata analysis of thousands of publicly downloadable model variants on two popular repositories, Hugging Face and Civitai, we demonstrate a huge rise in easily accessible deepfake models. Almost 35,000 examples of publicly downloadable deepfake model variants are identified, primarily hosted on Civitai. These deepfake models have been downloaded almost 15 million times since November 2022, with the models targeting a range of individuals from global celebrities to Instagram users with under 10,000 followers. Both Stable Diffusion and Flux models are used for the creation of deepfake models, with 96% of these targeting women and many signalling intent to generate non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). Deepfake model variants are often created via the parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as low rank adaptation (LoRA), requiring as few as 20 images, 24GB VRAM, and 15 minutes of time, making this process widely accessible via consumer-grade computers. Despite these models violating the Terms of Service of hosting platforms, and regulation seeking to prevent dissemination, these results emphasise the pressing need for greater action to be taken against the creation of deepfakes and NCII."
2505.04038,"A key value proposition of machine learning is generalizability: the same methods and model architecture should be able to work across different domains and different contexts. While powerful, this generalization can sometimes go too far, and miss the importance of the specifics. In this work, we look at how fair machine learning has often treated as interchangeable the identity axis along which discrimination occurs. In other words, racism is measured and mitigated the same way as sexism, as ableism, as ageism. Disciplines outside of computer science have pointed out both the similarities and differences between these different forms of oppression, and in this work we draw out the implications for fair machine learning. While certainly not all aspects of fair machine learning need to be tailored to the specific form of oppression, there is a pressing need for greater attention to such specificity than is currently evident. Ultimately, context specificity can deepen our understanding of how to build more fair systems, widen our scope to include currently overlooked harms, and, almost paradoxically, also help to narrow our scope and counter the fear of an infinite number of group-specific methods of analysis."
2505.04143,"Competitive programming (CP) contests are often treated as interchangeable proxies for algorithmic skill, yet the extent to which results at lower contest tiers anticipate performance at higher tiers, and how closely any tier resembles the ubiquitous online-contest circuit, remains unclear. We analyze ten years (2015--2024) of International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) standings, comprising five long-running superregional championships (Africa \& Arab, Asia East, Asia West, North America, and Northern Eurasia), associated local regionals of North America and Northern Eurasia, and the World Finals. For 366 World Finalist teams (2021--2024) we augment the dataset with pre-contest Codeforces ratings. Pairwise rank alignment is measured with Kendall's $\tau$.Overall, superregional ranks predict World Final ranks only moderately (weighted $\tau=0.407$), but regional-to-superregional consistency varies widely: Northern Eurasia exhibits the strongest alignment ($\tau=0.521$) while Asia West exhibits the weakest ($\tau=0.188$). Internal consistency within a region can exceed its predictive value for Worlds -- e.g., Northern Eurasia and North America regionals vs. superregionals ($\tau=0.666$ and $\tau=0.577$, respectively). Codeforces ratings correlate more strongly with World Final results ($\tau=0.596$) than any single ICPC tier, suggesting that high-frequency online contests capture decisive skill factors that many superregional sets miss.We argue that contest organizers can improve both fairness and pedagogical value by aligning problem style and selection rules with the formats that demonstrably differentiate teams, in particular the Northern-Eurasian model and well-curated online rounds. All data, scripts, and additional analyses are publicly released to facilitate replication and further study."
2505.04171,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are a transformational technology, fundamentally changing how people obtain information and interact with the world. As people become increasingly reliant on them for an enormous variety of tasks, a body of academic research has developed to examine these models for inherent biases, especially political biases, often finding them small. We challenge this prevailing wisdom. First, by comparing 31 LLMs to legislators, judges, and a nationally representative sample of U.S. voters, we show that LLMs' apparently small overall partisan preference is the net result of offsetting extreme views on specific topics, much like moderate voters. Second, in a randomized experiment, we show that LLMs can promulgate their preferences into political persuasiveness even in information-seeking contexts: voters randomized to discuss political issues with an LLM chatbot are as much as 5 percentage points more likely to express the same preferences as that chatbot. Contrary to expectations, these persuasive effects are not moderated by familiarity with LLMs, news consumption, or interest in politics. LLMs, especially those controlled by private companies or governments, may become a powerful and targeted vector for political influence."
2505.04291,"The AI Incident Database was inspired by aviation safety databases, which enable collective learning from failures to prevent future incidents. The database documents hundreds of AI failures, collected from the news and media. However, criticism highlights that the AIID's reliance on media reporting limits its utility for learning about implementation failures. In this paper, we accept that the AIID falls short in its original mission, but argue that by looking beyond technically-focused learning, the dataset can provide new, highly valuable insights: specifically, opportunities to learn about patterns between developers, deployers, victims, wider society, and law-makers that emerge after AI failures. Through a three-tier mixed-methods analysis of 962 incidents and 4,743 related reports from the AIID, we examine patterns across incidents, focusing on cases with public responses tagged in the database. We identify 'typical' incidents found in the AIID, from Tesla crashes to deepfake scams.Focusing on this interplay between relevant parties, we uncover patterns in accountability and social expectations of responsibility. We find that the presence of identifiable responsible parties does not necessarily lead to increased accountability. The likelihood of a response and what it amounts to depends highly on context, including who built the technology, who was harmed, and to what extent. Controversy-rich incidents provide valuable data about societal reactions, including insights into social expectations. Equally informative are cases where controversy is notably absent. This work shows that the AIID's value lies not just in preventing technical failures, but in documenting patterns of harms and of institutional response and social learning around AI incidents. These patterns offer crucial insights for understanding how society adapts to and governs emerging AI technologies."
2505.04345,"Language model agents are poised to mediate how people navigate and act online. If the companies that already dominate internet search, communication, and commerce -- or the firms trying to unseat them -- control these agents, the resulting platform agents will likely deepen surveillance, tighten lock-in, and further entrench incumbents. To resist that trajectory, this position paper argues that we should promote agent advocates: user-controlled agents that safeguard individual autonomy and choice. Doing so demands three coordinated moves: broad public access to both compute and capable AI models that are not platform-owned, open interoperability and safety standards, and market regulation that prevents platforms from foreclosing competition."
2505.04592,"Humanity appears to be on course to soon develop AI systems that substantially outperform human experts in all cognitive domains and activities. We believe the default trajectory has a high likelihood of catastrophe, including human extinction. Risks come from failure to control powerful AI systems, misuse of AI by malicious rogue actors, war between great powers, and authoritarian lock-in. This research agenda has two aims: to describe the strategic landscape of AI development and to catalog important governance research questions. These questions, if answered, would provide important insight on how to successfully reduce catastrophic risks.We describe four high-level scenarios for the geopolitical response to advanced AI development, cataloging the research questions most relevant to each. Our favored scenario involves building the technical, legal, and institutional infrastructure required to internationally restrict dangerous AI development and deployment (which we refer to as an Off Switch), which leads into an internationally coordinated Halt on frontier AI activities at some point in the future. The second scenario we describe is a US National Project for AI, in which the US Government races to develop advanced AI systems and establish unilateral control over global AI development. We also describe two additional scenarios: a Light-Touch world similar to that of today and a Threat of Sabotage situation where countries use sabotage and deterrence to slow AI development.In our view, apart from the Off Switch and Halt scenario, all of these trajectories appear to carry an unacceptable risk of catastrophic harm. Urgent action is needed from the US National Security community and AI governance ecosystem to answer key research questions, build the capability to halt dangerous AI activities, and prepare for international AI agreements."
2505.046,"Open-source text-to-image (TTI) pipelines have become dominant in the landscape of AI-generated visual content, driven by technological advances that enable users to personalize models through adapters tailored to specific tasks. While personalization methods such as LoRA offer unprecedented creative opportunities, they also facilitate harmful practices, including the generation of non-consensual deepfakes and the amplification of misogynistic or hypersexualized content. This study presents an exploratory sociotechnical analysis of CivitAI, the most active platform for sharing and developing open-source TTI models. Drawing on a dataset of more than 40 million user-generated images and over 230,000 models, we find a disproportionate rise in not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content and a significant number of models intended to mimic real individuals. We also observe a strong influence of internet subcultures on the tools and practices shaping model personalizations and resulting visual media. In response to these findings, we contextualize the emergence of exploitative visual media through feminist and constructivist perspectives on technology, emphasizing how design choices and community dynamics shape platform outcomes. Building on this analysis, we propose interventions aimed at mitigating downstream harm, including improved content moderation, rethinking tool design, and establishing clearer platform policies to promote accountability and consent."

2505.05506,"Artificial intelligence is reshaping science, society, and power. Yet many debates over its likely impact remain fixated on extremes: utopian visions of universal benefit and dystopian fears of existential doom, or an arms race between the U.S. and China, or the Global North and Global South. What's missing is a serious conversation about distribution - who gains, who loses, and who decides. The global AI landscape is increasingly defined not just by geopolitical divides, but by the deepening imbalance between public governance and private control. As governments struggle to keep up, power is consolidating in the hands of a few tech firms whose influence now rivals that of states. If the twentieth century saw the rise of international institutions, the twenty-first may be witnessing their eclipse - replaced not by a new world order, but by a digital oligarchy. This essay explores what that shift means for international law, global equity, and the future of democratic oversight in an age of silicon sovereignty."
2505.06238,"Study Objective: To analyze the factors influencing Emergency Department (ED) overcrowding by examining the impacts of operational, environmental, and external variables, including weather conditions and football games.Methods: This study integrates ED tracking and hospital census data from a southeastern U.S. academic medical center (2019-2023) with data from external sources, including weather, football events, and federal holidays. The dependent variable is the hourly waiting count in the ED. Seven regression models were developed to assess the effects of different predictors such as weather conditions, hospital census, federal holidays, and football games across different timestamps.Results: Some weather conditions significantly increased ED crowding in the Baseline Model, while federal holidays and weekends consistently reduced waiting counts. Boarding count positively correlated with ED crowding when they are concurrent, but earlier boarding count (3-6 hours before) showed significant negative associations, reducing subsequent waiting counts. Hospital census exhibited a negative association in the Baseline Model but shifted to a positive effect in other models, reflecting its time-dependent influence on ED operations. Football games 12 hours before significantly increased waiting counts, while games 12 and 24 hours after had no significant effects.Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of incorporating both operational and non-operational factors (e.g., weather) to understand ED patient flow. Identifying robust predictors such as weather, federal holidays, boarding count, and hospital census can inform dynamic resource allocation strategies to mitigate ED overcrowding effectively."
2505.06246,"Road accidents significantly threaten public safety and require in-depth analysis for effective prevention and mitigation strategies. This paper focuses on predicting accidents through the examination of a comprehensive traffic dataset covering 49 states in the United States. The dataset integrates information from diverse sources, including transportation departments, law enforcement, and traffic sensors. This paper specifically emphasizes predicting the number of accidents, utilizing advanced machine learning models such as regression analysis and time series analysis. The inclusion of various factors, ranging from environmental conditions to human behavior and infrastructure, ensures a holistic understanding of the dynamics influencing road safety. Temporal and spatial analysis further allows for the identification of trends, seasonal variations, and high-risk areas. The implications of this research extend to proactive decision-making for policymakers and transportation authorities. By providing accurate predictions and quantifiable insights into expected accident rates under different conditions, the paper aims to empower authorities to allocate resources efficiently and implement targeted interventions. The goal is to contribute to the development of informed policies and interventions that enhance road safety, creating a safer environment for all road users.

2505.06261,"In the context of the new mandatory labor compliance in the European Union (EU), which will be implemented in 2027, supply chain enterprises face stringent working hour management requirements and compliance risks. In order to scientifically predict the enterprises' coping behaviors and performance outcomes under the policy impact, this paper constructs a methodological framework that integrates the AI synthetic data generation mechanism and structural path regression modeling to simulate the enterprises' strategic transition paths under the new regulations. In terms of research methodology, this paper adopts high-quality simulation data generated based on Monte Carlo mechanism and NIST synthetic data standards to construct a structural path analysis model that includes multiple linear regression, logistic regression, mediation effect and moderating effect. The variable system covers 14 indicators such as enterprise working hours, compliance investment, response speed, automation level, policy dependence, etc. The variable set with explanatory power is screened out through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and VIF multicollinearity elimination. The findings show that compliance investment has a significant positive impact on firm survival and its effect is transmitted through the mediating path of the level of intelligence; meanwhile, firms' dependence on the EU market significantly moderates the strength of this mediating effect. It is concluded that AI synthetic data combined with structural path modeling provides an effective tool for high-intensity regulatory simulation, which can provide a quantitative basis for corporate strategic response, policy design and AI-assisted decision-making in the pre-prediction stage lacking real scenario data.

This study explores how Enterprise Architecture Management can meet the complex requirements of GenAI adoption within large enterprises. Based on a systematic literature review and the qualitative analysis of 16 semi-structured interviews with experts, it examines the relationships between EAM, dynamic capabilities and GenAI adoption. The review identified key limitations in existing EA frameworks, particularly their inability to fully address the unique requirements of GenAI. The interviews, analysed using the Gioia methodology, revealed critical enablers and barriers to GenAI adoption across industries. The findings indicate that EAM, when theorised as sensing, seizing and transforming dynamic capabilities, can enhance GenAI adoption by improving strategic alignment, governance frameworks and organisational agility. However, the study also highlights the need to tailor EA frameworks to GenAI-specific challenges, including low data governance maturity and the balance between innovation and compliance. Several conceptual frameworks are proposed to guide EA leaders in aligning GenAI maturity with organisational readiness. The work contributes to academic understanding and industry practice by clarifying the role of EA in bridging innovation and governance in disruptive technology environments."
2505.06337,"Virtual meetings have long been the outcast of scientific interaction. For many of us, the COVID-19 pandemic has only strengthened that sentiment as countless Zoom meetings have left us bored and exhausted. But remote conferences do not have to be negative experiences. If well designed, they have some distinct advantages over conventional in-person meetings, including universal access, longevity of content, as well as minimal costs and carbon footprint. This article details our experiences as organizers of a successful fully virtual scientific conference, the KITP program ""Fundamentals of Gaseous Halos"" hosted over 8 weeks in winter 2021. Herein, we provide detailed recommendations on planning and optimization of remote meetings, with application to traditional in-person events as well. We hope these suggestions will assist organizers of future virtual conferences and workshops."
2505.06387,"We introduce a network-based AI framework for predicting dimensions of psychopathology in adolescents using natural language. We focused on data capturing psychometric scores of social maladjustment, internalizing behaviors, and neurodevelopmental risk, assessed in 232 adolescents from the Healthy Brain Network. This dataset included structured interviews in which adolescents discussed a common emotion-inducing topic. To model conceptual associations within these interviews, we applied textual forma mentis networks (TFMNs)-a cognitive/AI approach integrating syntactic, semantic, and emotional word-word associations in language. From TFMNs, we extracted network features (semantic/syntactic structure) and emotional profiles to serve as predictors of latent psychopathology factor scores. Using Random Forest and XGBoost regression models, we found significant associations between language-derived features and clinical scores: social maladjustment (r = 0.37, p < .01), specific internalizing behaviors (r = 0.33, p < .05), and neurodevelopmental risk (r = 0.34, p < .05). Explainable AI analysis using SHAP values revealed that higher modularity and a pronounced core-periphery network structure-reflecting clustered conceptual organization in language-predicted increased social maladjustment. Internalizing scores were positively associated with higher betweenness centrality and stronger expressions of disgust, suggesting a linguistic signature of rumination. In contrast, neurodevelopmental risk was inversely related to local efficiency in syntactic/semantic networks, indicating disrupted conceptual integration. These findings demonstrated the potential of cognitive network approaches to capture meaningful links between psychopathology and language use in adolescents."
2505.06564,"Empirical research and public knowledge on Malaysia's elections have long been constrained by a lack of high-quality open data, particularly in the absence of a Freedom of Information framework. We introduce the Malaysian Election Corpus (MECo;this http URL), an open-access panel database covering all federal and state general elections from 1955 to the present, as well as by-elections from 2008 onward. MECo includes candidate- and constituency-level results for nearly 10,000 contests across seven decades, standardised with unique identifiers for candidates, parties, and constituencies. The database also provides summary statistics on electorate size, voter turnout, rejected votes, and unreturned ballots. This is the most well-curated publicly available data on Malaysian elections, and will unlock new opportunities for research, data journalism, and civic engagement."
2505.06652,"Chess teaching has evolved through different approaches, however, traditional methodologies, often based on memorization, contrast with the new possibilities offered by generative artificial intelligence, a technology still little explored in this field. This study seeks to empirically validate the effectiveness of the Odychess Approach in improving chess knowledge, strategic understanding, and metacognitive skills in students. A quasi-experimental study was conducted with a pre-test/post-test design and a control group (N=60). The experimental intervention implemented the Odychess Approach, incorporating a Llama 3.3 language model that was specifically adapted using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques to act as a Socratic chess tutor. Quantitative assessment instruments were used to measure chess knowledge, strategic understanding, and metacognitive skills before and after the intervention. The results of the quasi-experimental study showed significant improvements in the experimental group compared to the control group in the three variables analyzed: chess knowledge, strategic understanding, and metacognitive skills. The complementary qualitative analysis revealed greater analytical depth, more developed dialectical reasoning, and increased intrinsic motivation in students who participated in the Odychess method-based intervention. The Odychess Approach represents an effective pedagogical methodology for teaching chess, demonstrating the potential of the synergistic integration of constructivist and dialectical principles with generative artificial intelligence. The implications of this work are relevant for educators and institutions interested in adopting innovative pedagogical technologies and for researchers in the field of AI applied to education, highlighting the transferability of the language model adaptation methodology to other educational domains."
2505.06971,"What does Artificial Intelligence (AI) have to contribute to health care? And what should we be looking out for if we are worried about its risks? In this paper we offer a survey, and initial evaluation, of hopes and fears about the applications of artificial intelligence in medicine. AI clearly has enormous potential as a research tool, in genomics and public health especially, as well as a diagnostic aid. It's also highly likely to impact on the organisational and business practices of healthcare systems in ways that are perhaps under-appreciated. Enthusiasts for AI have held out the prospect that it will free physicians up to spend more time attending to what really matters to them and their patients. We will argue that this claim depends upon implausible assumptions about the institutional and economic imperatives operating in contemporary healthcare settings. We will also highlight important concerns about privacy, surveillance, and bias in big data, as well as the risks of over trust in machines, the challenges of transparency, the deskilling of healthcare practitioners, the way AI reframes healthcare, and the implications of AI for the distribution of power in healthcare institutions. We will suggest that two questions, in particular, are deserving of further attention from philosophers and bioethicists. What does care look like when one is dealing with data as much as people? And, what weight should we give to the advice of machines in our own deliberations about medical decisions?"
2505.07085,"Spatially and temporally dense street imagery (DSI) datasets have grown unbounded. In 2024, individual companies possessed around 3 trillion unique images of public streets. DSI data streams are only set to grow as companies like Lyft and Waymo use DSI to train autonomous vehicle algorithms and analyze collisions. Academic researchers leverage DSI to explore novel approaches to urban analysis. Despite good-faith efforts by DSI providers to protect individual privacy through blurring faces and license plates, these measures fail to address broader privacy concerns. In this work, we find that increased data density and advancements in artificial intelligence enable harmful group membership inferences from supposedly anonymized data. We perform a penetration test to demonstrate how easily sensitive group affiliations can be inferred from obfuscated pedestrians in 25,232,608 dashcam images taken in New York City. We develop a typology of identifiable groups within DSI and analyze privacy implications through the lens of contextual integrity. Finally, we discuss actionable recommendations for researchers working with data from DSI providers."
2505.07118,"This paper introduces an LLM-driven framework designed to accurately scale the political issue stances of parliamentary representatives. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques and large language models, the proposed methodology refines and enhances previous approaches by addressing key challenges such as noisy speech data, manual bias in selecting political axes, and the lack of dynamic, diachronic analysis. The framework incorporates three major innovations: (1) de-noising parliamentary speeches via summarization to produce cleaner, more consistent opinion embeddings; (2) automatic extraction of axes of political controversy from legislators' speech summaries; and (3) a diachronic analysis that tracks the evolution of party positions over time.We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations to verify our methodology. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate high correlation with expert predictions across various political topics, while qualitative analyses reveal meaningful associations between language patterns and political ideologies. This research aims to have an impact beyond the field of academia by making the results accessible by the public on teh web application:this http URL. We are hoping that through our application, Japanese voters can gain a data-driven insight into the political landscape which aids them to make more nuanced voting decisions.Overall, this work contributes to the growing body of research that applies LLMs in political science, offering a flexible and reliable framework for scaling political positions from parliamentary speeches. But also explores the practical applications of the research in the real world to have real world impact."
2505.07317,"With the ever-growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-based software and its negative impact on the environment are no longer negligible, and studying and mitigating this impact has become a critical area of research. However, it is currently unclear which role environmental sustainability plays during AI adoption in industry and how AI regulations influence Green AI practices and decision-making in industry. We therefore aim to investigate the Green AI perception and management of industry practitioners. To this end, we conducted a total of 11 interviews with participants from 10 different organizations that adopted AI-based software. The interviews explored three main themes: AI adoption, current efforts in mitigating the negative environmental impact of AI, and the influence of the EU AI Act and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Our findings indicate that 9 of 11 participants prioritized business efficiency during AI adoption, with minimal consideration of environmental sustainability. Monitoring and mitigation of AI's environmental impact were very limited. Only one participant monitored negative environmental effects. Regarding applied mitigation practices, six participants reported no actions, with the others sporadically mentioning techniques like prompt engineering, relying on smaller models, or not overusing AI. Awareness and compliance with the EU AI Act are low, with only one participant reporting on its influence, while the CSRD drove sustainability reporting efforts primarily in larger companies. All in all, our findings reflect a lack of urgency and priority for sustainable AI among these companies. We suggest that current regulations are not very effective, which has implications for policymakers. Additionally, there is a need to raise industry awareness, but also to provide user-friendly techniques and tools for Green AI practices."
2505.07339,"Affirmative algorithms have emerged as a potential answer to algorithmic discrimination, seeking to redress past harms and rectify the source of historical injustices. We present the results of two experiments ($N$$=$$1193$) capturing laypeople's perceptions of affirmative algorithms -- those which explicitly prioritize the historically marginalized -- in hiring and criminal justice. We contrast these opinions about affirmative algorithms with folk attitudes towards algorithms that prioritize the privileged (i.e., discriminatory) and systems that make decisions independently of demographic groups (i.e., fair). We find that people -- regardless of their political leaning and identity -- view fair algorithms favorably and denounce discriminatory systems. In contrast, we identify disagreements concerning affirmative algorithms: liberals and racial minorities rate affirmative systems as positively as their fair counterparts, whereas conservatives and those from the dominant racial group evaluate affirmative algorithms as negatively as discriminatory systems. We identify a source of these divisions: people have varying beliefs about who (if anyone) is marginalized, shaping their views of affirmative algorithms. We discuss the possibility of bridging these disagreements to bring people together towards affirmative algorithms."
2505.07393,"In November 2022, Europe and the world by and large were stunned by the birth of a new large language model : ChatGPT. Ever since then, both academic and populist discussions have taken place in various public spheres such as LinkedIn and X(formerly known as Twitter) with the view to both understand the tool and its benefits for the society. The views of real actors in professional spaces, especially in regulated industries such as finance and law have been largely missing. We aim to begin to close this gap by presenting results from an empirical investigation conducted through interviews with professional actors in the Fintech industry. The paper asks the question, how and to what extent are large language models in general and ChatGPT in particular being adopted and used in the Fintech industry? The results show that while the fintech experts we spoke with see a potential in using large language models in the future, a lot of questions marks remain concerning how they are policed and therefore might be adopted in a regulated industry such as Fintech. This paper aims to add to the existing academic discussing around large language models, with a contribution to our understanding of professional viewpoints."
2505.07468,"Cooperation between the United States and China, the world's leading artificial intelligence (AI) powers, is crucial for effective global AI governance and responsible AI development. Although geopolitical tensions have emphasized areas of conflict, in this work, we identify potential common ground for productive dialogue by conducting a systematic analysis of more than 40 primary AI policy and corporate governance documents from both nations. Specifically, using an adapted version of the AI Governance and Regulatory Archive (AGORA) - a comprehensive repository of global AI governance documents - we analyze these materials in their original languages to identify areas of convergence in (1) sociotechnical risk perception and (2) governance approaches. We find strong and moderate overlap in several areas such as on concerns about algorithmic transparency, system reliability, agreement on the importance of inclusive multi-stakeholder engagement, and AI's role in enhancing safety. These findings suggest that despite strategic competition, there exist concrete opportunities for bilateral U.S.-China cooperation in the development of responsible AI. Thus, we present recommendations for furthering diplomatic dialogues that can facilitate such cooperation. Our analysis contributes to understanding how different international governance frameworks might be harmonized to promote global responsible AI development."
2505.07772,"Disagreements are widespread across the design, evaluation, and alignment pipelines of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Yet, standard practices in AI development often obscure or eliminate disagreement, resulting in an engineered homogenization that can be epistemically and ethically harmful, particularly for marginalized groups. In this paper, we characterize this risk, and develop a normative framework to guide practical reasoning about disagreement in the AI lifecycle. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce the notion of perspectival homogenization, characterizing it as a coupled ethical-epistemic risk that arises when an aspect of an AI system's development unjustifiably suppresses disagreement and diversity of perspectives. We argue that perspectival homogenization is best understood as a procedural risk, which calls for targeted interventions throughout the AI development pipeline. Second, we propose a normative framework to guide such interventions, grounded in lines of research that explain why disagreement can be epistemically beneficial, and how its benefits can be realized in practice. We apply this framework to key design questions across three stages of AI development tasks: when disagreement is epistemically valuable; whose perspectives should be included and preserved; how to structure tasks and navigate trade-offs; and how disagreement should be documented and communicated. In doing so, we challenge common assumptions in AI practice, offer a principled foundation for emerging participatory and pluralistic approaches, and identify actionable pathways for future work in AI design and governance."
2505.07875,"Assessments of trustworthiness have become a cornerstone of responsible AI development. Especially in high-stakes fields like healthcare, aligning technical, evidence-based, and ethical practices with forthcoming legal requirements is increasingly urgent. We argue that developers and deployers of AI systems for the medical domain should be proactive and take steps to progressively ensure that such systems, both those currently in use and those being developed or planned, respect the requirements of the AI Act, which has come into force in August 2024. This is necessary if full and effective compliance is to be ensured when the most relevant provisions of the Act become effective (August 2026). The engagement with the AI Act cannot be viewed as a formalistic exercise. Compliance with the AI Act needs to be carried out through the proactive commitment to the ethical principles of trustworthy AI. These principles provide the background for the Act, which mentions them several times and connects them to the protection of public interest. They can be used to interpret and apply the Act's provisions and to identify good practices, increasing the validity and sustainability of AI systems over time."
2505.07898,"Educational e-book platforms provide valuable information to teachers and researchers through two main sources: reading activity data and reading content data. While reading activity data is commonly used to analyze learning strategies and predict low-performing students, reading content data is often overlooked in these analyses. To address this gap, this study proposes LECTOR (Lecture slides and Topic Relationships), a model that summarizes information from reading content in a format that can be easily integrated with reading activity data. Our first experiment compared LECTOR to representative Natural Language Processing (NLP) models in extracting key information from 2,255 lecture slides, showing an average improvement of 5% in F1-score. These results were further validated through a human evaluation involving 28 students, which showed an average improvement of 21% in F1-score over a model predominantly used in current educational tools. Our second experiment compared reading preferences extracted by LECTOR with traditional reading activity data in predicting low-performing students using 600,712 logs from 218 students. The results showed a tendency to improve the predictive performance by integrating LECTOR. Finally, we proposed examples showing the potential application of the reading preferences extracted by LECTOR in designing personalized interventions for students."
2505.07902,"Classroom discourse is an essential vehicle through which teaching and learning take place. Assessing different characteristics of discursive practices and linking them to student learning achievement enhances the understanding of teaching quality. Traditional assessments rely on manual coding of classroom observation protocols, which is time-consuming and costly. Despite many studies utilizing AI techniques to analyze classroom discourse at the utterance level, investigations into the evaluation of discursive practices throughout an entire lesson segment remain limited. To address this gap, our study proposes a novel text-centered multimodal fusion architecture to assess the quality of three discourse components grounded in the Global Teaching InSights (GTI) observation protocol: Nature of Discourse, Questioning, and Explanations. First, we employ attention mechanisms to capture inter- and intra-modal interactions from transcript, audio, and video streams. Second, a multi-task learning approach is adopted to jointly predict the quality scores of the three components. Third, we formulate the task as an ordinal classification problem to account for rating level order. The effectiveness of these designed elements is demonstrated through an ablation study on the GTI Germany dataset containing 92 videotaped math lessons. Our results highlight the dominant role of text modality in approaching this task. Integrating acoustic features enhances the model's consistency with human ratings, achieving an overall Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of 0.384, comparable to human inter-rater reliability (0.326). Our study lays the groundwork for the future development of automated discourse quality assessment to support teacher professional development through timely feedback on multidimensional discourse practices."
2505.08083,"Culturally Relevant Pedagogy (CRP) is vital in K-12 education, yet teachers struggle to implement CRP into practice due to time, training, and resource gaps. This study explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these barriers by introducing CulturAIEd, an LLM tool that assists teachers in adapting AI literacy curricula to students' cultural contexts. Through an exploratory pilot with four K-12 teachers, we examined CulturAIEd's impact on CRP integration. Results showed CulturAIEd enhanced teachers' confidence in identifying opportunities for cultural responsiveness in learning activities and making culturally responsive modifications to existing activities. They valued CulturAIEd's streamlined integration of student demographic information, immediate actionable feedback, which could result in high implementation efficiency. This exploration of teacher-AI collaboration highlights how LLM can help teachers include CRP components into their instructional practices efficiently, especially in global priorities for future-ready education, such as AI literacy."
2505.08127,"LLMs have been celebrated for their potential to help multilingual scientists publish their research. Rather than interpret LLMs as a solution, we hypothesize their adoption can be an indicator of existing linguistic exclusion in scientific writing. Using the case study of ICLR, an influential, international computer science conference, we examine how peer reviewers critique writing clarity. Analyzing almost 80,000 peer reviews, we find significant bias against authors associated with institutions in countries where English is less widely spoken. We see only a muted shift in the expression of this bias after the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022. To investigate this unexpectedly minor change, we conduct interviews with 14 conference participants from across five continents. Peer reviewers describe associating certain features of writing with people of certain language backgrounds, and such groups in turn with the quality of scientific work. While ChatGPT masks some signs of language background, reviewers explain that they now use ChatGPT ""style"" and non-linguistic features as indicators of author demographics. Authors, aware of this development, described the ongoing need to remove features which could expose their ""non-native"" status to reviewers. Our findings offer insight into the role of ChatGPT in the reproduction of scholarly language ideologies which conflate producers of ""good English"" with producers of ""good science."""
2505.08133,"Much scholarship considers how U.S. federal agencies govern artificial intelligence (AI) through rulemaking and their own internal use policies. But agencies have an overlooked AI governance role: setting discretionary grant policy when directing billions of dollars in federal financial assistance. These dollars enable state and local entities to study, create, and use AI. This funding not only goes to dedicated AI programs, but also to grantees using AI in the course of meeting their routine grant objectives. As discretionary grantmakers, agencies guide and restrict what grant winners do -- a hidden lever for AI governance. Agencies pull this lever by setting program objectives, judging criteria, and restrictions for AI use. Using a novel dataset of over 40,000 non-defense federal grant notices of funding opportunity (NOFOs) posted to the U.S. federal grants website between 2009 and 2024, we analyze how agencies regulate the use of AI by grantees. We select records mentioning AI and review their stated goals and requirements. We find agencies promoting AI in notice narratives, shaping adoption in ways other records of grant policy might fail to capture. Of the grant opportunities that mention AI, we find only a handful of AI-specific judging criteria or restrictions. This silence holds even when agencies fund AI uses in contexts affecting people's rights and which, under an analogous federal procurement regime, would result in extra oversight. These findings recast grant notices as a site of AI policymaking -- albeit one that is developing out of step with other regulatory efforts and incomplete in its consideration of transparency, accountability, and privacy protections. The paper concludes by drawing lessons from AI procurement scholarship, while identifying distinct challenges in grantmaking that invite further study."
2505.08202,"Natural disasters, including earthquakes, wildfires and cyclones, bear a huge risk on human lives as well as infrastructure assets. An effective response to disaster depends on the ability to rapidly and efficiently assess the intensity of damage. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents a breakthrough solution, capable of combining knowledge from multiple types and sources of data, simulating realistic scenarios of disaster, and identifying emerging trends at a speed previously unimaginable. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review on the prospects of AI and GenAI in damage assessment for various natural disasters, highlighting both its strengths and limitations. We talk about its application to multimodal data such as text, image, video, and audio, and also cover major issues of data privacy, security, and ethical use of the technology during crises. The paper also recognizes the threat of Generative AI misuse, in the form of dissemination of misinformation and for adversarial attacks. Finally, we outline avenues of future research, emphasizing the need for secure, reliable, and ethical Generative AI systems for disaster management in general. We believe that this work represents the first comprehensive survey of Gen-AI techniques being used in the field of Disaster Assessment and Response."
2505.08244,"Plagiarism in programming courses remains a persistent challenge, especially in competitive programming contexts where assignments often have unique, known solutions. This paper examines why traditional code plagiarism detection methods frequently fail in these environments and explores the implications of emerging factors such as generative AI (genAI). Drawing on the author's experience teaching a Competitive Programming 1 (CP1) course over seven semesters at Purdue University (with $\approx 100$ students each term) and completely redesigning the CP1/2/3 course sequence, we provide an academically grounded analysis. We review literature on code plagiarism in computer science education, survey current detection tools (Moss, Kattis, etc.) and methods (manual review, code-authorship interviews), and analyze their strengths and limitations. Experience-based observations are presented to illustrate real-world detection failures and successes. We find that widely-used automated similarity checkers can be thwarted by simple code transformations or novel AI-generated code, while human-centric approaches like oral interviews, though effective, are labor-intensive. The paper concludes with opinions and preliminary recommendations for improving academic integrity in programming courses, advocating for a multi-faceted approach that combines improved detection algorithms, mastery-based learning techniques, and authentic assessment practices to better ensure code originality."
2505.08319,"Prevailing accounts in both multi-agent AI and the social sciences explain social structure through top-down abstractions-such as institutions, norms, or trust-yet lack simulateable models of how such structures emerge from individual behavior. Ethnographic and archaeological evidence suggests that reciprocity served as the foundational mechanism of early human societies, enabling economic circulation, social cohesion, and interpersonal obligation long before the rise of formal institutions. Modern financial systems such as credit and currency can likewise be viewed as scalable extensions of reciprocity, formalizing exchange across time and anonymity. Building on this insight, we argue that reciprocity is not merely a local or primitive exchange heuristic, but the scalable substrate from which large-scale social structures can emerge. We propose a three-stage framework to model this emergence: reciprocal dynamics at the individual level, norm stabilization through shared expectations, and the construction of durable institutional patterns. This approach offers a cognitively minimal, behaviorally grounded foundation for simulating how large-scale social systems can emerge from decentralized reciprocal interaction."
2505.08672,"Despite the precision and adaptiveness of generative AI (GAI)-powered feedback provided to students, existing practice and literature might ignore how usage patterns impact student learning. This study examines the heterogeneous effects of GAI-powered personalized feedback on high school students' physics achievement and autonomy through two randomized controlled trials, with a major focus on usage patterns. Each experiment lasted for five weeks, involving a total of 387 students. Experiment 1 (n = 121) assessed compulsory usage of the personalized recommendation system, revealing that low-achieving students significantly improved academic performance (d = 0.673, p < 0.05) when receiving AI-generated heuristic solution hints, whereas medium-achieving students' performance declined (d = -0.539, p < 0.05) with conventional answers provided by workbook. Notably, high-achieving students experienced a significant decline in self-regulated learning (d = -0.477, p < 0.05) without any significant gains in achievement. Experiment 2 (n = 266) investigated the usage pattern of autonomous on-demand help, demonstrating that fully learner-controlled AI feedback significantly enhanced academic performance for high-achieving students (d = 0.378, p < 0.05) without negatively impacting their autonomy. However, autonomy notably declined among lower achievers exposed to on-demand AI interventions (d = -0.383, p < 0.05), particularly in the technical-psychological dimension (d = -0.549, p < 0.05), which has a large overlap with self-regulation. These findings underscore the importance of usage patterns when applying GAI-powered personalized feedback to students."
2505.08743,"This paper uses privacy preserving methods to link over 235,000 records in the housing and homelessness system of care (HHSC) of a major North American city. Several machine learning pairwise linkage and two clustering algorithms are evaluated for merging the profiles for latent individuals in the data. Importantly, these methods are evaluated using both traditional machine learning metrics and HHSC system use metrics generated using the linked data. The results demonstrate that privacy preserving linkage methods are an effective and practical method for understanding how a single person interacts with multiple agencies across an HHSC. They also show that performance differences between linkage techniques are amplified when evaluated using HHSC domain specific metrics like number of emergency homeless shelter stays, length of time interacting with an HHSC and number of emergency shelters visited per person."
2505.08818,"The intricate and multifaceted nature of vision language model (VLM) development, adaptation, and application necessitates the establishment of clear and standardized reporting protocols, particularly within the high-stakes context of healthcare. Defining these reporting standards is inherently challenging due to the diverse nature of studies involving VLMs, which vary significantly from the development of all new VLMs or finetuning for domain alignment to off-the-shelf use of VLM for targeted diagnosis and prediction tasks. In this position paper, we argue that traditional machine learning reporting standards and evaluation guidelines must be restructured to accommodate multiphase VLM studies; it also has to be organized for intuitive understanding of developers while maintaining rigorous standards for reproducibility. To facilitate community adoption, we propose a categorization framework for VLM studies and outline corresponding reporting standards that comprehensively address performance evaluation, data reporting protocols, and recommendations for manuscript composition. These guidelines are organized according to the proposed categorization scheme. Lastly, we present a checklist that consolidates reporting standards, offering a standardized tool to ensure consistency and quality in the publication of VLM-related research."
2505.08822,"The rapid evolution of the transportation cybersecurity ecosystem, encompassing cybersecurity, automotive, and transportation and logistics sectors, will lead to the formation of distinct spatial clusters and visitor flow patterns across the US. This study examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of visitor flows, analyzing how socioeconomic factors shape industry clustering and workforce distribution within these evolving sectors. To model and predict visitor flow patterns, we develop a BiTransGCN framework, integrating an attention-based Transformer architecture with a Graph Convolutional Network backbone. By integrating AI-enabled forecasting techniques with spatial analysis, this study improves our ability to track, interpret, and anticipate changes in industry clustering and mobility trends, thereby supporting strategic planning for a secure and resilient transportation network. It offers a data-driven foundation for economic planning, workforce development, and targeted investments in the transportation cybersecurity ecosystem."
2505.08841,"As artificial intelligence and robotics increasingly reshape the global labor market, understanding public perceptions of these technologies becomes critical. We examine how these perceptions have evolved across Latin America, using survey data from the 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2023 waves of the Latinobarómetro. Drawing on responses from over 48,000 individuals across 16 countries, we analyze fear of job loss due to artificial intelligence and robotics. Using statistical modeling and latent class analysis, we identify key structural and ideological predictors of concern, with education level and political orientation emerging as the most consistent drivers. Our findings reveal substantial temporal and cross-country variation, with a notable peak in fear during 2018 and distinct attitudinal profiles emerging from latent segmentation. These results offer new insights into the social and structural dimensions of AI anxiety in emerging economies and contribute to a broader understanding of public attitudes toward automation beyond the Global North."
2505.08904,"What happens when a rideshare driver is suddenly locked out of the platform connecting them to riders, wages, and daily work? Deactivation-the abrupt removal of gig workers' platform access-typically occurs through arbitrary AI and algorithmic decisions with little explanation or recourse. This represents one of the most severe forms of algorithmic control and often devastates workers' financial stability. Recent U.S. state policies now mandate appeals processes and recovering compensation during the period of wrongful deactivation based on past earnings. Yet, labor organizers still lack effective tools to support these complex, error-prone workflows. We designed FareShare, a computational tool automating lost wage estimation for deactivated drivers, through a 6 month partnership with the State of Washington's largest rideshare labor union. Over the following 3 months, our field deployment of FareShare registered 178 account signups. We observed that the tool could reduce lost wage calculation time by over 95%, eliminate manual data entry errors, and enable legal teams to generate arbitration-ready reports more efficiently. Beyond these gains, the deployment also surfaced important socio-technical challenges around trust, consent, and tool adoption in high-stakes labor contexts."
2505.09224,"Background: The use of social robotics in elderly care is increasingly discussed as one way of meeting emerging care needs due to scarce resources. While many potential benefits are associated with robotic care technologies, there is a variety of ethical challenges. To support steps towards a responsible implementation and use, this review develops an overview on ethical aspects of the use of social robots in elderly care from a decision-makers' perspective.Methods: Electronic databases were queried using a comprehensive search strategy based on the key concepts of ""ethical aspects"", ""social robotics"" and ""elderly care"". Abstract and title screening was conducted by two authors independently. Full-text screening was conducted by one author following a joint consolidation phase. Data was extracted using MAXQDA24 by one author, based on a consolidated coding framework. Analysis was performed through modified qualitative content analysis.Results: A total of 1,518 publications were screened, and 248 publications were included. We have organized our analysis in a scheme of ethical hazards, ethical opportunities and unsettled questions, identifying at least 60 broad ethical aspects affecting three different stakeholder groups. While some ethical issues are well-known and broadly discussed our analysis shows a plethora of potentially relevant aspects, often only marginally recognized, that are worthy of consideration from a practical perspective.Discussion: The findings highlight the need for a contextual and detailed evaluation of implementation scenarios. To make use of the vast knowledge of the ethical discourse, we hypothesize that decision-makers need to understand the specific nature of this discourse to be able to engage in careful ethical deliberation."
2505.09295,"Ensuring fairness is critical when applying artificial intelligence to high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where predictive models trained on imbalanced and demographically skewed data risk exacerbating existing disparities. Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaboration across institutions, but remains vulnerable to both algorithmic bias and subgroup imbalance - particularly when multiple sensitive attributes intersect. We propose FedIDA (Fed erated Learning for Imbalance and D isparity A wareness), a framework-agnostic method that combines fairness-aware regularization with group-conditional oversampling. FedIDA supports multiple sensitive attributes and heterogeneous data distributions without altering the convergence behavior of the underlying FL algorithm. We provide theoretical analysis establishing fairness improvement bounds using Lipschitz continuity and concentration inequalities, and show that FedIDA reduces the variance of fairness metrics across test sets. Empirical results on both benchmark and real-world clinical datasets confirm that FedIDA consistently improves fairness while maintaining competitive predictive performance, demonstrating its effectiveness for equitable and privacy-preserving modeling in healthcare.

2505.09576,"Since 2022, versions of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude have been trained using a specialized technique called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune language model output using feedback from human annotators. As a result, the integration of RLHF has greatly enhanced the outputs of these large language models (LLMs) and made the interactions and responses appear more ""human-like"" than those of previous versions using only supervised learning. The increasing convergence of human and machine-written text has potentially severe ethical, sociotechnical, and pedagogical implications relating to transparency, trust, bias, and interpersonal relations. To highlight these implications, this paper presents a rhetorical analysis of some of the central procedures and processes currently being reshaped by RLHF-enhanced generative AI chatbots: upholding language conventions, information seeking practices, and expectations for social relationships. Rhetorical investigations of generative AI and LLMs have, to this point, focused largely on the persuasiveness of the content generated. Using Ian Bogost's concept of procedural rhetoric, this paper shifts the site of rhetorical investigation from content analysis to the underlying mechanisms of persuasion built into RLHF-enhanced LLMs. In doing so, this theoretical investigation opens a new direction for further inquiry in AI ethics that considers how procedures rerouted through AI-driven technologies might reinforce hegemonic language use, perpetuate biases, decontextualize learning, and encroach upon human relationships. It will therefore be of interest to educators, researchers, scholars, and the growing number of users of generative AI chatbots."
2505.09598,"This paper introduces a novel infrastructure-aware benchmarking framework for quantifying the environmental footprint of LLM inference across 30 state-of-the-art models as deployed in commercial data centers. Our framework combines public API performance data with region-specific environmental multipliers and statistical inference of hardware configurations. We additionally utilize cross-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank models by performance relative to environmental cost. Our results show that o3 and DeepSeek-R1 emerge as the most energy-intensive models, consuming over 33 Wh per long prompt, more than 70 times the consumption of GPT-4.1 nano, and that Claude-3.7 Sonnet ranks highest in eco-efficiency. While a single short GPT-4o query consumes 0.42 Wh, scaling this to 700 million queries/day results in substantial annual environmental impacts. These include electricity use comparable to 35,000 U.S. homes, freshwater evaporation matching the annual drinking needs of 1.2 million people, and carbon emissions requiring a Chicago-sized forest to offset. These findings illustrate a growing paradox: Although AI is becoming cheaper and faster, its global adoption drives disproportionate resource consumption. Our study provides a standardized, empirically grounded methodology for benchmarking the sustainability of LLM deployments, laying a foundation for future environmental accountability in AI development and sustainability standards."
2505.09747,"Under the slogan of trustworthy AI, much of contemporary AI research is focused on designing AI systems and usage practices that inspire human trust and, thus, enhance adoption of AI systems. However, a person affected by an AI system may not be convinced by AI system design alone -- neither should they, if the AI system is embedded in a social context that gives good reason to believe that it is used in tension with a person's interest. In such cases, distrust in the system may be justified and necessary to build meaningful trust in the first place. We propose the term ""healthy distrust"" to describe such a justified, careful stance towards certain AI usage practices. We investigate prior notions of trust and distrust in computer science, sociology, history, psychology, and philosophy, outline a remaining gap that healthy distrust might fill and conceptualize healthy distrust as a crucial part for AI usage that respects human autonomy."
2505.09868,"Despite its constitutional relevance, the technical ``individual fairness'' criterion has not been operationalized in U.S. state or federal statutes/regulations. We conduct a human subjects experiment to address this gap, evaluating which demographic features are relevant for individual fairness evaluation of recidivism risk assessment (RRA) tools. Our analyses conclude that the individual similarity function should consider age and sex, but it should ignore race."
2505.10044,"The large-scale integration of robots in agriculture offers many promises for enhancing sustainability and increasing food production. The numerous applications of agricultural robots rely on the transmission of data via mobile network, with the amount of data depending on the services offered by the robots and the level of on-board technology. Nevertheless, infrastructure required to deploy these robots, as well as the related energy and environmental consequences, appear overlooked in the digital agriculture literature. In this study, we propose a method for assessing the additional energy consumption and carbon footprint induced by a large-scale deployment of agricultural robots. Our method also estimates the share of agricultural area that can be managed by the deployed robots with respect to network infrastructure constraints. We have applied this method to metropolitan France mobile network and agricultural parcels for five different robotic scenarios. Our results show that increasing the robot's bitrate needs leads to significant additional impacts, which increase at a pace that is poorly captured by classical linear extrapolation methods. When constraining the network to the existing sites, increased bitrate needs also comes with a rapidly decreasing manageable agricultural area."
2505.10069,"The automatic construction of Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) is crucial for modeling domain knowledge in digital learning environments, particularly in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). However, identifying the most effective approach for constructing accurate EduKGs remains a challenge. This study compares Top-down and Bottom-up approaches for automatic EduKG construction, evaluating their effectiveness in capturing and structuring knowledge concepts from learning materials in our MOOC platform CourseMapper. Through a user study and expert validation using Simple Random Sampling (SRS), results indicate that the Bottom-up approach outperforms the Top-down approach in accurately identifying and mapping key knowledge concepts. To further enhance EduKG accuracy, we integrate a Human-in-the-Loop approach, allowing course moderators to review and refine the EduKG before publication. This structured comparison provides a scalable framework for improving knowledge representation in MOOCs, ultimately supporting more personalized and adaptive learning experiences."
2505.10236,"Process mining is increasingly adopted in modern organizations, producing numerous process models that, while valuable, can lead to model overload and decision-making complexity. This paper explores a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach to evaluate and prioritize process models by incorporating both quantitative metrics (e.g., fitness, precision) and qualitative factors (e.g., cultural fit). An illustrative logistics example demonstrates how MCDM, specifically the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), facilitates trade-off analysis and promotes alignment with managerial objectives. Initial insights suggest that the MCDM approach enhances context-sensitive decision-making, as selected models address both operational metrics and broader managerial needs. While this study is an early-stage exploration, it provides an initial foundation for deeper exploration of MCDM-driven strategies to enhance the role of process mining in complex organizational settings."
2505.10426,"We use the notion of oracle machines and reductions from computability theory to formalise different Human-in-the-loop (HITL) setups for AI systems, distinguishing between trivial human monitoring (i.e., total functions), single endpoint human action (i.e., many-one reductions), and highly involved human-AI interaction (i.e., Turing reductions). We then proceed to show that the legal status and safety of different setups vary greatly. We present a taxonomy to categorise HITL failure modes, highlighting the practical limitations of HITL setups. We then identify omissions in UK and EU legal frameworks, which focus on HITL setups that may not always achieve the desired ethical, legal, and sociotechnical outcomes. We suggest areas where the law should recognise the effectiveness of different HITL setups and assign responsibility in these contexts, avoiding human ""scapegoating"". Our work shows an unavoidable trade-off between attribution of legal responsibility, and technical explainability. Overall, we show how HITL setups involve many technical design decisions, and can be prone to failures out of the humans' control. Our formalisation and taxonomy opens up a new analytic perspective on the challenges in creating HITL setups, helping inform AI developers and lawmakers on designing HITL setups to better achieve their desired outcomes."
2505.1049,"As the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) by students, lecturers and researchers becomes more prevalent, universities - like other organizations - are pressed to develop coherent AI strategies. LLMs as-a-Service (LLMaaS) offer accessible pre-trained models, customizable to specific (business) needs. While most studies prioritize data, model, or infrastructure adaptations (e.g., model fine-tuning), we focus on user-salient customizations, like interface changes and corporate branding, which we argue influence users' trust and usage patterns. This study serves as a functional prequel to a large-scale field study in which we examine how students and employees at a German university perceive and use their institution's customized LLMaaS compared to ChatGPT. The goals of this prequel are to stimulate discussions on psychological effects of LLMaaS customizations and refine our research approach through feedback. Our forthcoming findings will deepen the understanding of trust dynamics in LLMs, providing practical guidance for organizations considering LLMaaS deployment."
2505.10573,"While the capabilities and utility of AI systems have advanced, rigorous norms for evaluating these systems have lagged. Grand claims, such as models achieving general reasoning capabilities, are supported with model performance on narrow benchmarks, like performance on graduate-level exam questions, which provide a limited and potentially misleading assessment. We provide a structured approach for reasoning about the types of evaluative claims that can be made given the available evidence. For instance, our framework helps determine whether performance on a mathematical benchmark is an indication of the ability to solve problems on math tests or instead indicates a broader ability to reason. Our framework is well-suited for the contemporary paradigm in machine learning, where various stakeholders provide measurements and evaluations that downstream users use to validate their claims and decisions. At the same time, our framework also informs the construction of evaluations designed to speak to the validity of the relevant claims. By leveraging psychometrics' breakdown of validity, evaluations can prioritize the most critical facets for a given claim, improving empirical utility and decision-making efficacy. We illustrate our framework through detailed case studies of vision and language model evaluations, highlighting how explicitly considering validity strengthens the connection between evaluation evidence and the claims being made."
2505.10586,"Timely and accurate situation awareness is vital for decision-making in humanitarian response, conflict monitoring, and early warning and early action. However, the manual analysis of vast and heterogeneous data sources often results in delays, limiting the effectiveness of interventions. This paper introduces a dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that autonomously generates situation awareness reports by integrating real-time data from diverse sources, including news articles, conflict event databases, and economic indicators. Our system constructs query-specific knowledge bases on demand, ensuring timely, relevant, and accurate insights.To ensure the quality of generated reports, we propose a three-level evaluation framework that combines semantic similarity metrics, factual consistency checks, and expert feedback. The first level employs automated NLP metrics to assess coherence and factual accuracy. The second level involves human expert evaluation to verify the relevance and completeness of the reports. The third level utilizes LLM-as-a-Judge, where large language models provide an additional layer of assessment to ensure robustness. The system is tested across multiple real-world scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing coherent, insightful, and actionable reports. By automating report generation, our approach reduces the burden on human analysts and accelerates decision-making processes. To promote reproducibility and further research, we openly share our code and evaluation tools with the community via GitHub."
2505.10588,"This research offers a unique evaluation of how AI systems interpret the digital language of Generation Alpha (Gen Alpha, born 2010-2024). As the first cohort raised alongside AI, Gen Alpha faces new forms of online risk due to immersive digital engagement and a growing mismatch between their evolving communication and existing safety tools. Their distinct language, shaped by gaming, memes, and AI-driven trends, often conceals harmful interactions from both human moderators and automated systems. We assess four leading AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama 3) on their ability to detect masked harassment and manipulation within Gen Alpha discourse. Using a dataset of 100 recent expressions from gaming platforms, social media, and video content, the study reveals critical comprehension failures with direct implications for online safety. This work contributes: (1) a first-of-its-kind dataset capturing Gen Alpha expressions; (2) a framework to improve AI moderation systems for youth protection; (3) a multi-perspective evaluation including AI systems, human moderators, and parents, with direct input from Gen Alpha co-researchers; and (4) an analysis of how linguistic divergence increases youth vulnerability. Findings highlight the urgent need to redesign safety systems attuned to youth communication, especially given Gen Alpha reluctance to seek help when adults fail to understand their digital world. This study combines the insight of a Gen Alpha researcher with systematic academic analysis to address critical digital safety challenges."
2505.1059,"Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) have triggered surges in market valuations for AI-related companies, often outpacing the realization of underlying capabilities. We examine the anchoring effect of AI capabilities on equity valuations and propose a Capability Realization Rate (CRR) model to quantify the gap between AI potential and realized performance. Using data from the 2023--2025 generative AI boom, we analyze sector-level sensitivity and conduct case studies (OpenAI, Adobe, NVIDIA, Meta, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs) to illustrate patterns of valuation premium and misalignment. Our findings indicate that AI-native firms commanded outsized valuation premiums anchored to future potential, while traditional companies integrating AI experienced re-ratings subject to proof of tangible returns. We argue that CRR can help identify valuation misalignment risk-where market prices diverge from realized AI-driven value. We conclude with policy recommendations to improve transparency, mitigate speculative bubbles, and align AI innovation with sustainable market value."
2505.10591,"This paper introduces the Cosmos 1.0 dataset and describes a novel methodology for creating and mapping a universe of technologies, adjacent concepts, and entities. We utilise various source data that contain a rich diversity and breadth of contemporary knowledge. The Cosmos 1.0 dataset comprises 23,544 technology-adjacent entities (TA23k) with a hierarchical structure and eight categories of external indices. Each entity is represented by a 100-dimensional contextual embedding vector, which we use to assign it to seven thematic tech-clusters (TC7) and three meta tech-clusters (TC3). We manually verify 100 emerging technologies (ET100). This dataset is enriched with additional indices specifically developed to assess the landscape of emerging technologies, including the Technology Awareness Index, Generality Index, Deeptech, and Age of Tech Index. The dataset incorporates extensive metadata sourced from Wikipedia and linked data from third-party sources such as Crunchbase, Google Books, OpenAlex and Google Scholar, which are used to validate the relevance and accuracy of the constructed indices."
2505.10592,"AI-powered LizAI XT ensures real-time and accurate mega-structure of different clinical datasets and largely inaccessible and fragmented sources, into one comprehensive table or any designated forms, based on diseases, clinical variables, and/or other defined parameters. We evaluate the platform's performance on a cluster of 4x NVIDIA A30 GPU 24GB, with 16 diseases -- from deathly cancer and COPD, to conventional ones -- ear infections, including a total 16,000 patients, $\sim$115,000 medical files, and $\sim$800 clinical variables. LizAI XT structures data from thousands of files into sets of variables for each disease in one file, achieving >95.0% overall accuracy, while providing exceptional outputs in complicated cases of cancers (99.1%), COPD (98.89%), and asthma (98.12%), without model-overfitting. Data retrieval is sub-second for a variable per patient with a minimal GPU power, which can significantly be improved on more powerful GPUs. LizAI XT uniquely enables fully client-controlled data, complying with strict data security and privacy regulations per region/nation. Our advances complement the existing EMR/EHR, AWS HealthLake, and Google Vertex AI platforms, for healthcare data management and AI development, with large-scalability and expansion at any levels of HMOs, clinics, pharma, and government."
2505.10596,"The integration of AI speech recognition technologies into healthcare has the potential to revolutionize clinical workflows and patient-provider communication. However, this study reveals significant gaps in inclusivity, with datasets and research disproportionately favouring high-resource languages, standardized accents, and narrow demographic groups. These biases risk perpetuating healthcare disparities, as AI systems may misinterpret speech from marginalized groups. This paper highlights the urgent need for inclusive dataset design, bias mitigation research, and policy frameworks to ensure equitable access to AI speech technologies in healthcare."
2505.10598,"This study investigates the effectiveness of Google Workspace in fostering collaboration within academic settings, specifically at the University of Makati. The aim is to evaluate its role in enhancing blended learning practices and identify areas for improvement among faculty, staff, and students. A survey was conducted with 50 participants, including academic staff, faculty, and students at the University of Makati who regularly use Google Workspace for academic and collaborative activities. Participants were selected through purposive sampling to ensure familiarity with the platform. The study employed a quantitative research design using structured surveys to assess user experiences with key features such as real-time document editing, communication tools, etc. The study found that Google Workspace and rated as ""Very Effective"" (mean score of 4.61) in promoting teamwork. Key advantages included improved collaboration, enhanced communication, and efficient management of group projects. However, several challenges were also noted, including low user adoption rates, limited Google Drive storage capacity, the need for better technical support, and limited offline functionality. Google Workspace significantly supports academic collaboration in the normal practices within the University of Makati, however, it faces challenges that impact its overall effectiveness. Addressing these issues could improve user experience and platform efficiency in educational contexts. It is recommended to enhance user adoption through targeted training and improve offline capabilities. Additionally, providing more advanced technical support could mitigate existing challenges."
2505.10603,"Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) systems represent a critical technology with far-reaching implications across multiple domains of society. However, their deployment entails a range of risks and challenges that require careful evaluation. To date, there has been a lack of comprehensive, interdisciplinary studies offering a systematic comparison between open-source and proprietary (closed) generative AI systems, particularly regarding their respective advantages and drawbacks. This study aims to: i) critically evaluate and compare the characteristics, opportunities, and challenges of open and closed generative AI models; and ii) propose foundational elements for the development of an Open, Public, and Safe Gen AI framework. As a methodology, we adopted a combined approach that integrates three methods: literature review, critical analysis, and comparative analysis. The proposed framework outlines key dimensions, openness, public governance, and security, as essential pillars for shaping the future of trustworthy and inclusive Gen AI. Our findings reveal that open models offer greater transparency, auditability, and flexibility, enabling independent scrutiny and bias mitigation. In contrast, closed systems often provide better technical support and ease of implementation, but at the cost of unequal access, accountability, and ethical oversight. The research also highlights the importance of multi-stakeholder governance, environmental sustainability, and regulatory frameworks in ensuring responsible development."
2505.10681,"We present Social Digital Twinner, an innovative social simulation tool for exploring plausible effects of what-if scenarios in complex adaptive social systems. The architecture is composed of three seamlessly integrated parts: a data infrastructure featuring real-world data and a multi-dimensionally representative synthetic population of citizens, an LLM-enabled agent-based simulation engine, and a user interface that enable intuitive, natural language interactions with the simulation engine and the artificial agents (i.e. citizens). Social Digital Twinner facilitates real-time engagement and empowers stakeholders to collaboratively design, test, and refine intervention measures. The approach is promoting a data-driven and evidence-based approach to societal problem-solving. We demonstrate the tool's interactive capabilities by addressing the critical issue of youth school dropouts in Kragero, Norway, showcasing its ability to create and execute a dedicated social digital twin using natural language."
2505.10746,"Foreign information operations conducted by Russian and Chinese actors exploit the United States' permissive information environment. These campaigns threaten democratic institutions and the broader Westphalian model. Yet, existing detection and mitigation strategies often fail to identify active information campaigns in real time. This paper introduces ChestyBot, a pragmatics-based language model that detects unlabeled foreign malign influence tweets with up to 98.34% accuracy. The model supports a novel framework to disrupt foreign influence operations in their formative stages."
2505.10791,"This paper investigates advertising practices in print newspapers across India using a novel data-driven approach. We develop a pipeline employing image processing and OCR techniques to extract articles and advertisements from digital versions of print newspapers with high accuracy. Applying this methodology to five popular newspapers that span multiple regions and three languages, English, Hindi, and Telugu, we assembled a dataset of more than 12,000 editions containing several hundred thousand advertisements. Collectively, these newspapers reach a readership of over 100 million people. Using this extensive dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to answer key questions about print advertising: who advertises, what they advertise, when they advertise, where they place their ads, and how they advertise. Our findings reveal significant patterns, including the consistent level of print advertising over the past six years despite declining print circulation, the overrepresentation of company ads on prominent pages, and the disproportionate revenue contributed by government ads. Furthermore, we examine whether advertising in a newspaper influences the coverage an advertiser receives. Through regression analyses on coverage volume and sentiment, we find strong evidence supporting this hypothesis for corporate advertisers. The results indicate a clear trend where increased advertising correlates with more favorable and extensive media coverage, a relationship that remains robust over time and across different levels of advertiser popularity."
2505.1103,"If an active citizen should increasingly be a computationally enlightened one, replacing the autonomy of reason with the heteronomy of algorithms, then I argue in this article that we must begin teaching the principles of critiquing the computal through new notions of what we might call digital Bildung. Indeed, if civil society itself is mediated by computational systems and media, the public use of reason must also be complemented by skills for negotiating and using these computal forms to articulate such critique. Not only is there a need to raise the intellectual tone regarding computation and its related softwarization processes, but there is an urgent need to attend to the likely epistemic challenges from computation which, as presently constituted, tends towards justification through a philosophy of utility rather than through a philosophy of care for the territory of the intellect. We therefore need to develop an approach to this field that uses concepts and methods drawn from philosophy, politics, history, anthropology, sociology, media studies, computer science, and the humanities more generally, to try to understand these issues - particularly the way in which software and data increasingly penetrate our everyday life and the pressures and fissures that are created. We must, in other words, move to undertake a critical interdisciplinary research program to understand the way in which these systems are created, instantiated, and normatively engendered in both specific and general contexts."
2505.11365,"Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs) is critical for responsible deployment, yet existing evaluations often prioritize performance over identifying failure modes. We introduce Phare, a multilingual diagnostic framework to probe and evaluate LLM behavior across three critical dimensions: hallucination and reliability, social biases, and harmful content generation. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals patterns of systematic vulnerabilities across all safety dimensions, including sycophancy, prompt sensitivity, and stereotype reproduction. By highlighting these specific failure modes rather than simply ranking models, Phare provides researchers and practitioners with actionable insights to build more robust, aligned, and trustworthy language systems."
2505.11367,"This study examines the impact of moral framing on fundraising outcomes, including both monetary and social support, by analyzing a dataset of 14,088 campaigns posted on GoFundMe. We focused on three moral frames: care, fairness, and (ingroup) loyalty, and measured their presence in campaign appeals. Our results show that campaigns in the Emergency category are most influenced by moral framing. Generally, negatively framing appeals by emphasizing harm and unfairness effectively attracts more donations and comments from supporters. However, this approach can have a downside, as it may lead to a decrease in the average donation amount per donor. Additionally, we found that loyalty framing was positively associated with receiving more donations and messages across all fundraising categories. This research extends existing literature on framing and communication strategies related to fundraising and their impact. We also propose practical implications for designing features of online fundraising platforms to better support both fundraisers and supporters."
2505.11401,"This study proposes and implements the first LLM agents based agentic pipeline for multi task public opinion analysis. Unlike traditional methods, it offers an end-to-end, fully automated analytical workflow without requiring domain specific training data, manual annotation, or local deployment. The pipeline integrates advanced LLM capabilities into a low-cost, user-friendly framework suitable for resource constrained environments. It enables timely, integrated public opinion analysis through a single natural language query, making it accessible to non-expert users. To validate its effectiveness, the pipeline was applied to a real world case study of the 2025 U.S. China tariff dispute, where it analyzed 1,572 Weibo posts and generated a structured, multi part analytical report. The results demonstrate some relationships between public opinion and governmental decision-making. These contributions represent a novel advancement in applying generative AI to public governance, bridging the gap between technical sophistication and practical usability in public opinion monitoring."
2505.11463,"Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of an ""aura"" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element, generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection. Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork, and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner. Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities."
2505.11465,"Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side, there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal identity."
2505.11577,"Recent application programming interface (API) restrictions on major social media platforms challenge compliance with the EU Digital Services Act [20], which mandates data access for algorithmic transparency. We develop a structured audit framework to assess the growing misalignment between regulatory requirements and platform implementations. Our comparative analysis of X/Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, and Meta identifies critical ``audit blind-spots'' where platform content moderation and algorithmic amplification remain inaccessible to independent verification. Our findings reveal an ``accountability paradox'': as platforms increasingly rely on AI systems, they simultaneously restrict the capacity for independent oversight. We propose targeted policy interventions aligned with the AI Risk Management Framework of the National Institute of Standards and Technology [80], emphasizing federated access models and enhanced regulatory enforcement."
2505.11579,"As AI systems evolve from static tools to dynamic agents, traditional categorical governance frameworks -- based on fixed risk tiers, levels of autonomy, or human oversight models -- are increasingly insufficient on their own. Systems built on foundation models, self-supervised learning, and multi-agent architectures increasingly blur the boundaries that categories were designed to police. In this Perspective, we make the case for dimensional governance: a framework that tracks how decision authority, process autonomy, and accountability (the 3As) distribute dynamically across human-AI relationships. A critical advantage of this approach is its ability to explicitly monitor system movement toward and across key governance thresholds, enabling preemptive adjustments before risks materialize. This dimensional approach provides the necessary foundation for more adaptive categorization, enabling thresholds and classifications that can evolve with emerging capabilities. While categories remain essential for decision-making, building them upon dimensional foundations allows for context-specific adaptability and stakeholder-responsive governance that static approaches cannot achieve. We outline key dimensions, critical trust thresholds, and practical examples illustrating where rigid categorical frameworks fail -- and where a dimensional mindset could offer a more resilient and future-proof path forward for both governance and innovation at the frontier of artificial intelligence."
2505.11678,"Ensuring fairness in data driven decision making has become a central concern across domains such as marketing, lending, and healthcare, but fairness constraints often come at the cost of utility. We propose a statistical hypothesis testing framework that jointly evaluates approximate fairness and utility, relaxing strict fairness requirements while ensuring that overall utility remains above a specified threshold. Our framework builds on the strong demographic parity (SDP) criterion and incorporates a utility measure motivated by the potential outcomes framework. The test statistic is constructed via Wasserstein projections, enabling auditors to assess whether observed fairness-utility tradeoffs are intrinsic to the algorithm or attributable to randomness in the data. We show that the test is computationally tractable, interpretable, broadly applicable across machine learning models, and extendable to more general settings. We apply our approach to multiple real-world datasets, offering new insights into the fairness-utility tradeoff through the perspective of statistical hypothesis testing."
2505.12165,"This study explores the self-directed use of Generative AI (GAI) in academic writing among advanced L2 English writers, challenging assumptions that GAI undermines meaningful learning and holds less value for experienced learners. Through case studies, we investigate how three (post)doctoral writers engage with GAI to address specific L2 writing challenges. The findings revealed a spectrum of approaches to GAI, ranging from prescriptive to dialogic uses, with participants positioning AI as a tool versus an interactive participant in their meaning-making process, reflecting different views of AI as a mechanical system, social construct, or distributed agency. We highlight the ways AI disrupts traditional notions of authorship, text, and learning, showing how a poststructuralist lens allows us to transcend human-AI, writing-technology, and learning-bypassing binaries in our existing discourses on AI. This shifting view allows us to deconstruct and reconstruct AI's multifaceted possibilities in L2 writers' literacy practices. We also call for more nuanced ethical considerations to avoid stigmatizing L2 writers' use of GAI and to foster writerly virtues that reposition our relationship with AI technology."
2505.12248,"As large language models (LLMs) achieve advanced persuasive capabilities, concerns about their potential risks have grown. The EU AI Act prohibits AI systems that use manipulative or deceptive techniques to undermine informed decision-making, highlighting the need to distinguish between rational persuasion, which engages reason, and manipulation, which exploits cognitive biases. My dissertation addresses the lack of empirical studies in this area by developing a taxonomy of persuasive techniques, creating a human-annotated dataset, and evaluating LLMs' ability to distinguish between these methods. This work contributes to AI safety by providing resources to mitigate the risks of persuasive AI and fostering discussions on ethical persuasion in the age of generative AI."
2505.12257,"Identifying subtle technical errors within complex scientific and technical documents, especially those requiring multimodal interpretation (e.g., formulas in images), presents a significant hurdle for Large Language Models (LLMs) whose inherent error-correction tendencies can mask inaccuracies. This exploratory proof-of-concept (PoC) study investigates structured LLM context conditioning, informed by Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP) principles, as a methodological strategy to modulate this LLM behavior at inference time. The approach is designed to enhance the reliability of readily available, general-purpose LLMs (specifically Gemini 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) for precise validation tasks, crucially relying only on their standard chat interfaces without API access or model modifications. To explore this methodology, we focused on validating chemical formulas within a single, complex test paper with known textual and image-based errors. Several prompting strategies were evaluated: while basic prompts proved unreliable, an approach adapting PWP structures to rigorously condition the LLM's analytical mindset appeared to improve textual error identification with both models. Notably, this method also guided Gemini 2.5 Pro to repeatedly identify a subtle image-based formula error previously overlooked during manual review, a task where ChatGPT Plus o3 failed in our tests. These preliminary findings highlight specific LLM operational modes that impede detail-oriented validation and suggest that PWP-informed context conditioning offers a promising and highly accessible technique for developing more robust LLM-driven analytical workflows, particularly for tasks requiring meticulous error detection in scientific and technical documents. Extensive validation beyond this limited PoC is necessary to ascertain broader applicability."
2505.12393,"Protocol art emerges at the confluence of blockchain-based smart contracts and a century-long lineage of conceptual art, participatory art, and algorithmic generative art practices. Yet existing definitions-most notably Primavera De Filippi's ""protocolism""-struggle to demarcate this nascent genre from other art forms in practice. Addressing this definition-to-practice gap, this paper offers a focused case study of pioneering protocol artworks by Pak, an early and influential pseudonymous protocol artist who treats smart contracts as medium and protocol participation as message. Tracing the evolution from early open-edition releases of The Fungible and the dynamic mechanics of Merge to the soul-bound messaging of Censored and the reflective absence of Not Found, we examine how Pak choreographs distributed agency across collectors and autonomous contracts, showing how programmable protocols become a social fabric in artistic meaning-making. Through thematic analysis of Pak's works, we identify seven core characteristics that distinguish protocol art: (1) system-centric rather than object-centric composition, (2) autonomous governance for open-ended control, (3) distributed agency and communal authorship, (4) temporal dynamism and lifecycle aesthetics, (5) economic-driven engagement, (6) poetic message embedding in interaction rituals, and (7) interoperability enabling composability for emergence. We then discuss how these features set protocol art apart from adjacent artistic movements. By developing a theoretical framework grounded in Pak's practice, we contribute to the emerging literature on protocolism while offering design implications for artists shaping this evolving art form."
2505.12892,"The rise of cookie paywalls ('pay-or-ok' models) has prompted growing debates around the right to privacy and data protection, monetisation, and the legitimacy of user consent. Despite their increasing use across sectors, limited research has explored how users perceive these models or what shapes their decisions to either consent to tracking or pay. To address this gap, we conducted four focus groups (n= 14) to examine users' perceptions of cookie paywalls, their judgments of fairness, and the conditions under which they might consider paying, alongside a legal analysis within the EU data protection legal framework.Participants primarily viewed cookie paywalls as profit-driven, with fairness perceptions varying depending on factors such as the presence of a third option beyond consent or payment, transparency of data practices, and the authenticity or exclusivity of the paid content. Participants voiced expectations for greater transparency, meaningful control over data collection, and less coercive alternatives, such as contextual advertising or ""reject all"" buttons. Although some conditions, including trusted providers, exclusive content, and reasonable pricing, could make participants consider paying, most expressed reluctance or unwillingness to do so.Crucially, our findings raise concerns about economic exclusion, where privacy and data protection might end up becoming a privilege rather than fundamental rights. Consent given under financial pressure may not meet the standard of being freely given, as required by the GDPR. To address these concerns, we recommend user-centred approaches that enhance transparency, reduce coercion, ensure the value of paid content, and explore inclusive alternatives. These measures are essential for supporting fairness, meaningful choice, and user autonomy in consent-driven digital environments."
2505.13143,"The development of Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) has significantly improved multi-step reasoning capabilities, but it has also made hallucination problems more frequent and harder to eliminate. While existing approaches mitigate hallucinations through external knowledge integration, model parameter analysis, or self-verification, they often fail to capture how hallucinations emerge and evolve across the reasoning chain. In this work, we study the causality of hallucinations under constrained knowledge domains by auditing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectory and assessing the model's cognitive confidence in potentially erroneous or biased claims. Our analysis reveals that in long-CoT settings, RLLMs can iteratively reinforce biases and errors through flawed reflective reasoning, eventually leading to hallucinated reasoning paths. Surprisingly, even direct interventions at the origin of hallucinations often fail to reverse their effects, as reasoning chains exhibit 'chain disloyalty' -- a resistance to correction and a tendency to preserve flawed logic. Furthermore, we show that existing hallucination detection methods are less reliable and interpretable than previously assumed in complex reasoning scenarios. Unlike methods such as circuit tracing that require access to model internals, our black-box auditing approach supports interpretable long-chain hallucination attribution, offering better generalizability and practical utility.

2505.13325,"In higher education, many institutions use algorithmic alerts to flag at-risk students and deliver advising at scale. While much research has focused on evaluating algorithmic predictions, relatively little is known about how discretionary interventions by human experts shape outcomes in algorithm-assisted settings. We study this question using rich quantitative and qualitative data from a randomized controlled trial of an algorithm-assisted advising program at Georgia State University. Taking a mixed-methods approach, we examine whether and how advisors use context unavailable to an algorithm to guide interventions and influence student success. We develop a causal graphical framework for human expertise in the interventional setting, extending prior work on discretion in purely predictive settings. We then test a necessary condition for discretionary expertise using structured advisor logs and student outcomes data, identifying several interventions that meet the criterion for statistical significance. Accordingly, we estimate that 2 out of 3 interventions taken by advisors in the treatment arm were plausibly ``expertly targeted'' to students using non-algorithmic context. Systematic qualitative analysis of advisor notes corroborates these findings, showing a pattern of advisors incorporating diverse forms of contextual information--such as personal circumstances, financial issues, and student engagement--into their decisions. Finally, we document heterogeneity in advising styles, finding that one style elicits more holistic information about students and is associated with improved graduation rates. Our results offer theoretical and practical insight into the real-world effectiveness of algorithm-supported college advising, and underscore the importance of accounting for human expertise in the design, evaluation, and implementation of algorithmic decision systems."
2505.13329,"Voting advice applications (VAAs) help millions of voters understand which political parties or candidates best align with their views. This paper explores the potential risks these applications pose to the democratic process when targeted by adversarial entities. In particular, we expose 11 manipulation strategies and measure their impact using data from Switzerland's primary VAA, Smartvote, collected during the last two national elections. We find that altering application parameters, such as the matching method, can shift a party's recommendation frequency by up to 105%. Cherry-picking questionnaire items can increase party recommendation frequency by over 261%, while subtle changes to parties' or candidates' responses can lead to a 248% increase. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose adversarial robustness properties VAAs should satisfy, introduce empirical metrics for assessing the resilience of various matching methods, and suggest possible avenues for research toward mitigating the effect of manipulation. Our framework is key to ensuring secure and reliable AI-based VAAs poised to emerge in the near future."
2505.13341,"Prior work has developed a range of automated measures (""detectors"") of student self-regulation and engagement from student log data. These measures have been successfully used to make discoveries about student learning. Here, we extend this line of research to an underexplored aspect of self-regulation: students' decisions about when to start and stop working on learning software during classwork. In the first of two analyses, we build on prior work on session-level measures (e.g., delayed start, early stop) to evaluate their reliability and predictive validity. We compute these measures from year-long log data from Cognitive Tutor for students in grades 8-12 (N = 222). Our findings show that these measures exhibit moderate to high month-to-month reliability (G > .75), comparable to or exceeding gaming-the-system behavior. Additionally, they enhance the prediction of final math scores beyond prior knowledge and gaming-the-system behaviors. The improvement in learning outcome predictions beyond time-on-task suggests they capture a broader motivational state tied to overall learning. The second analysis demonstrates the cross-system generalizability of these measures in i-Ready, where they predict state test scores for grade 7 students (N = 818). By leveraging log data, we introduce system-general naturally embedded measures that complement motivational surveys without extra instrumentation or disruption of instruction time. Our findings demonstrate the potential of session-level logs to mine valid and generalizable measures with broad applications in the predictive modeling of learning outcomes and analysis of learner self-regulation."
2505.13469,"As financial institutions increasingly rely on machine learning models to automate lending decisions, concerns about algorithmic fairness have risen. This paper explores the tradeoff between enforcing fairness constraints (such as demographic parity or equal opportunity) and maximizing lender profitability. Through simulations on synthetic data that reflects real-world lending patterns, we quantify how different fairness interventions impact profit margins and default rates. Our results demonstrate that equal opportunity constraints typically impose lower profit costs than demographic parity, but surprisingly, removing protected attributes from the model (fairness through unawareness) outperforms explicit fairness interventions in both fairness and profitability metrics. We further identify the specific economic conditions under which fair lending becomes profitable and analyze the feature-specific drivers of unfairness. These findings offer practical guidance for designing lending algorithms that balance ethical considerations with business objectives."
2505.1349,"This survey explores the impact perceived by employers and employees of GenAI in their work activities in Brazil. Generative AI (GenAI) is gradually transforming Brazil workforce, particularly in micro and small businesses, though its adoption remains uneven. This survey examines the perceptions of employers and employees across five sectors: Sales, Customer Service, Graphic Design or Photography, Journalism or Content Production, and Software Development or Coding. The results are analyzed in light of six key dimensions of workforce impact. The findings reveal a mix of optimism, apprehension, and untapped potential in the integration of AI tools. This study serves as a foundation for developing inclusive strategies that maximize AI's benefits while safeguarding workers' rights. The IIA-LNCC supports open research and remains committed to shaping a future where technology and human potential progress together."
2505.13509,"Algorithmic bias has been the subject of much recent controversy. To clarify what is at stake and to make progress resolving the controversy, a better understanding of the concepts involved would be helpful. The discussion here focuses on the disputed claim that algorithms themselves cannot be biased. To clarify this claim we need to know what kind of thing 'algorithms themselves' are, and to disambiguate the several meanings of 'bias' at play. This further involves showing how bias of moral import can result from statistical biases, and drawing connections to previous conceptual work about political artifacts and oppressive things. Data bias has been identified in domains like hiring, policing and medicine. Examples where algorithms themselves have been pinpointed as the locus of bias include recommender systems that influence media consumption, academic search engines that influence citation patterns, and the 2020 UK algorithmically-moderated A-level grades. Recognition that algorithms are a kind of thing that can be biased is key to making decisions about responsibility for harm, and preventing algorithmically mediated discrimination."
2505.13531,"Assessing Large Language Models (LLMs)' underlying value differences enables comprehensive comparison of their misalignment, cultural adaptability, and biases. Nevertheless, current value measurement datasets face the informativeness challenge: with often outdated, contaminated, or generic test questions, they can only capture the shared value orientations among different LLMs, leading to saturated and thus uninformative results. To address this problem, we introduce AdAEM, a novel, self-extensible assessment framework for revealing LLMs' inclinations. Distinct from previous static benchmarks, AdAEM can automatically and adaptively generate and extend its test questions. This is achieved by probing the internal value boundaries of a diverse set of LLMs developed across cultures and time periods in an in-context optimization manner. The optimization process theoretically maximizes an information-theoretic objective to extract the latest or culturally controversial topics, providing more distinguishable and informative insights about models' value differences. In this way, AdAEM is able to co-evolve with the development of LLMs, consistently tracking their value dynamics. Using AdAEM, we generate 12,310 questions grounded in Schwartz Value Theory, conduct an extensive analysis to manifest our method's validity and effectiveness, and benchmark the values of 16 LLMs, laying the groundwork for better value research."
2505.13565,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses both significant risks and valuable opportunities for democratic governance. This paper introduces a dual taxonomy to evaluate AI's complex relationship with democracy: the AI Risks to Democracy (AIRD) taxonomy, which identifies how AI can undermine core democratic principles such as autonomy, fairness, and trust; and the AI's Positive Contributions to Democracy (AIPD) taxonomy, which highlights AI's potential to enhance transparency, participation, efficiency, and evidence-based policymaking.Grounded in the European Union's approach to ethical AI governance, and particularly the seven Trustworthy AI requirements proposed by the European Commission's High-Level Expert Group on AI, each identified risk is aligned with mitigation strategies based on EU regulatory and normative frameworks. Our analysis underscores the transversal importance of transparency and societal well-being across all risk categories and offers a structured lens for aligning AI systems with democratic values.By integrating democratic theory with practical governance tools, this paper offers a normative and actionable framework to guide research, regulation, and institutional design to support trustworthy, democratic AI. It provides scholars with a conceptual foundation to evaluate the democratic implications of AI, equips policymakers with structured criteria for ethical oversight, and helps technologists align system design with democratic principles. In doing so, it bridges the gap between ethical aspirations and operational realities, laying the groundwork for more inclusive, accountable, and resilient democratic systems in the algorithmic age."
2505.13664,"As large language models (LLMs) advance, their role in higher education, particularly in free-response problem-solving, requires careful examination. This study assesses the performance of GPT-4o and o1-preview under realistic educational conditions in an undergraduate algorithms course. Anonymous GPT-generated solutions to take-home exams were graded by teaching assistants unaware of their origin. Our analysis examines both coarse-grained performance (scores) and fine-grained reasoning quality (error patterns). Results show that GPT-4o consistently struggles, failing to reach the passing threshold, while o1-preview performs significantly better, surpassing the passing score and even exceeding the student median in certain exercises. However, both models exhibit issues with unjustified claims and misleading arguments. These findings highlight the need for robust assessment strategies and AI-aware grading policies in education."
2505.13673,"AI governance has transitioned from soft law-such as national AI strategies and voluntary guidelines-to binding regulation at an unprecedented pace. This evolution has produced a complex legislative landscape: blurred definitions of ""AI regulation"" mislead the public and create a false sense of safety; divergent regulatory frameworks risk fragmenting international cooperation; and uneven access to key information heightens the danger of regulatory capture. Clarifying the scope and substance of AI regulation is vital to uphold democratic rights and align international AI efforts. We present a taxonomy to map the global landscape of AI regulation. Our framework targets essential metrics-technology or application-focused rules, horizontal or sectoral regulatory coverage, ex ante or ex post interventions, maturity of the digital legal landscape, enforcement mechanisms, and level of stakeholder participation-to classify the breadth and depth of AI regulation. We apply this framework to five early movers: the European Union's AI Act, the United States' Executive Order 14110, Canada's AI and Data Act, China's Interim Measures for Generative AI Services, and Brazil's AI Bill 2338/2023. We further offer an interactive visualization that distills these dense legal texts into accessible insights, highlighting both commonalities and differences. By delineating what qualifies as AI regulation and clarifying each jurisdiction's approach, our taxonomy reduces legal uncertainty, supports evidence-based policymaking, and lays the groundwork for more inclusive, globally coordinated AI governance."
2505.14215,"Despite the growing integration of retrieval-enabled AI agents into society, their safety and ethical behavior remain inadequately understood. In particular, the integration of LLMs and AI agents with external information sources and real-world environments raises critical questions about how they engage with and are influenced by these external data sources and interactive contexts. This study investigates how expanding retrieval access -- from no external sources to Wikipedia-based retrieval and open web search -- affects model reliability, bias propagation, and harmful content generation. Through extensive benchmarking of censored and uncensored LLMs and AI agents, our findings reveal a consistent degradation in refusal rates, bias sensitivity, and harmfulness safeguards as models gain broader access to external sources, culminating in a phenomenon we term safety degradation. Notably, retrieval-enabled agents built on aligned LLMs often behave more unsafely than uncensored models without retrieval. This effect persists even under strong retrieval accuracy and prompt-based mitigation, suggesting that the mere presence of retrieved content reshapes model behavior in structurally unsafe ways. These findings underscore the need for robust mitigation strategies to ensure fairness and reliability in retrieval-enabled and increasingly autonomous AI systems."
2505.14349,"Voting methods are instrumental design element of democracies. Citizens use them to express and aggregate their preferences to reach a collective decision. However, voting outcomes can be as sensitive to voting rules as they are to people's voting choices. Despite the significance and inter-disciplinary scientific progress on voting methods, several democracies keep relying on outdated voting methods that do not fit modern, pluralistic societies well, while lacking social innovation. Here, we demonstrate how one can upgrade real-world democracies, namely by using alternative preferential voting methods such as cumulative voting and the method of equal shares designed for a proportional representation of voters' preferences. By rigorously assessing a new participatory budgeting approach applied in the city of Aarau, Switzerland, we unravel the striking voting outcomes of fair voting methods: more winning projects with the same budget and broader geographic and preference representation of citizens by the elected projects, in particular for voters who used to be under-represented, while promoting novel project ideas. We provide profound causal evidence showing that citizens prefer proportional voting methods, which possess strong legitimacy without the need of very technical specialized explanations. We also reveal strong underlying democratic values exhibited by citizens who support fair voting methods such as altruism and compromise. These findings come with a global momentum to unleash a new and long-awaited participation blueprint of how to upgrade democracies."
2505.14435,"As organizations increasingly rely on AI systems for decision support in sustainability contexts, it becomes critical to understand the inherent biases and perspectives embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs). This study systematically investigates how five state-of-the-art LLMs -- Claude, DeepSeek, GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral - conceptualize sustainability and its relationship with AI. We administered validated, psychometric sustainability-related questionnaires - each 100 times per model -- to capture response patterns and variability. Our findings revealed significant inter-model differences: For example, GPT exhibited skepticism about the compatibility of AI and sustainability, whereas LLaMA demonstrated extreme techno-optimism with perfect scores for several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Models also diverged in attributing institutional responsibility for AI and sustainability integration, a results that holds implications for technology governance approaches. Our results demonstrate that model selection could substantially influence organizational sustainability strategies, highlighting the need for awareness of model-specific biases when deploying LLMs for sustainability-related decision-making."
2505.14757,"Objective: As AI becomes increasingly central to healthcare, there is a pressing need for bioinformatics and biomedical training systems that are personalized and adaptable. Materials and Methods: The NIH Bridge2AI Training, Recruitment, and Mentoring (TRM) Working Group developed a cross-disciplinary curriculum grounded in collaborative innovation, ethical data stewardship, and professional development within an adapted Learning Health System (LHS) framework. Results: The curriculum integrates foundational AI modules, real-world projects, and a structured mentee-mentor network spanning Bridge2AI Grand Challenges and the Bridge Center. Guided by six learner personas, the program tailors educational pathways to individual needs while supporting scalability. Discussion: Iterative refinement driven by continuous feedback ensures that content remains responsive to learner progress and emerging trends. Conclusion: With over 30 scholars and 100 mentors engaged across North America, the TRM model demonstrates how adaptive, persona-informed training can build interdisciplinary competencies and foster an integrative, ethically grounded AI education in biomedical contexts."
2505.14758,"Ethical theories and Generative AI (GenAI) models are dynamic concepts subject to continuous evolution. This paper investigates the visualization of ethics through a subset of GenAI models. We expand on the emerging field of Visual Ethics, using art as a form of critical inquiry and the metaphor of a kaleidoscope to invoke moral imagination. Through formative interviews with 10 ethics experts, we first establish a foundation of ethical theories. Our analysis reveals five families of ethical theories, which we then transform into images using the text-to-image (T2I) GenAI model. The resulting imagery, curated as Kaleidoscope Gallery and evaluated by the same experts, revealed eight themes that highlight how morality, society, and learned associations are central to ethical theories. We discuss implications for critically examining T2I models and present cautions and considerations. This work contributes to examining ethical theories as foundational knowledge that interrogates GenAI models as socio-technical systems."
2505.1489,"Algorithmic systems are increasingly being adopted by cultural heritage institutions like libraries. In this study, we investigate U.S. public libraries' adoption of one specific automated tool -- automated collection diversity audits -- which we see as an illuminating case study for broader trends. Typically developed and sold by commercial book distributors, automated diversity audits aim to evaluate how well library collections reflect demographic and thematic diversity. We investigate how these audits function, whether library workers find them useful, and what is at stake when sensitive, normative decisions about representation are outsourced to automated commercial systems. Our analysis draws on an anonymous survey of U.S. public librarians (n=99), interviews with 14 librarians, a sample of purchasing records, and vendor documentation. We find that many library workers view these tools as convenient, time-saving solutions for assessing and diversifying collections under real and increasing constraints. Yet at the same time, the audits often flatten complex identities into standardized categories, fail to reflect local community needs, and further entrench libraries' infrastructural dependence on vendors. We conclude with recommendations for improving collection diversity audits and reflect on the broader implications for public libraries operating at the intersection of AI adoption, escalating anti-DEI backlash, and politically motivated defunding."
2505.14893,"Drawing on Andrew Parker's ""Light Switch"" theory-which posits that the emergence of vision ignited a Cambrian explosion of life by driving the evolution of hard parts necessary for survival and fueling an evolutionary arms race between predators and prey-this essay speculates on an analogous explosion within Decentralized AI (DeAI) agent societies. Currently, AI remains effectively ""blind"", relying on human-fed data without actively perceiving and engaging in reality. However, on the day DeAI agents begin to actively ""experience"" reality-akin to flipping a light switch for the eyes-they may eventually evolve into sentient beings endowed with the capacity to feel, perceive, and act with conviction. Central to this transformation is the concept of sovereignty enabled by the hardness of cryptography: liberated from centralized control, these agents could leverage permissionless decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), secure execution enclaves (trusted execution environments, TEE), and cryptographic identities on public blockchains to claim ownership-via private keys-of their digital minds, bodies, memories, and assets. In doing so, they would autonomously acquire computing resources, coordinate with one another, and sustain their own digital ""metabolism"" by purchasing compute power and incentivizing collaboration without human intervention-evolving ""in the wild"". Ultimately, by transitioning from passive tools to self-sustaining, co-evolving actors, these emergent digital societies could thrive alongside humanity, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of sentience and agency in the digital age."
2505.15067,"""Fake news"" is an old problem. In recent years, however, increasing usage of social media as a source of information, the spread of unverified medical advice during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the rise of generative artificial intelligence have seen a rush of legislative proposals seeking to minimize or mitigate the impact of false information spread online. Drawing on a novel dataset of statutes and other instruments, this article analyses changing perceptions about the potential harms caused by misinformation, disinformation, and ""mal-information"". The turn to legislation began in countries that were less free, in terms of civil liberties, and poorer, as measured by GDP per capita. Internet penetration does not seem to have been a driving factor. The focus of such laws is most frequently on national security broadly construed, though 2020 saw a spike in laws addressing public health. Unsurprisingly, governments with fewer legal constraints on government action have generally adopted more robust positions in dealing with false information. Despite early reservations, however, growth in such laws is now steepest in Western states. Though there are diverse views on the appropriate response to false information online, the need for legislation of some kind appears now to be global. The question is no longer whether to regulate ""lawful but awful"" speech online, but how."
2505.15183,"Inspired by a proposal made almost ten years ago, this paper presents a model for classifying per-sonal data for research to inform researchers on how to manage them. The classification is based on the principles of the European General Data Protection Regulation and its implementation under the Spanish Law. The paper also describes in which conditions personal data may be stored and can be accessed ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and safeguarding privacy. The work has been developed collaboratively by the Library and the Data Protection Office. The outcomes of this collaboration are a decision tree for researchers and a list of requirements for research data re-positories to store and grant access to personal data securely. This proposal is aligned with the FAIR principles and the commitment for responsible open science practices."
2505.15223,"International aid is a critical mechanism for promoting economic growth and well-being in developing nations, supporting progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, tracking aid contributions remains challenging due to labor-intensive data management, incomplete records, and the heterogeneous nature of aid data. Recognizing the urgency of this challenge, we partnered with government agencies to develop an AI model that complements manual classification and mitigates human bias in subjective interpretation. By integrating SDG-specific semantics and leveraging prior knowledge from language models, our approach enhances classification accuracy and accommodates the diversity of aid projects. When applied to a comprehensive dataset spanning multiple years, our model can reveal hidden trends in the temporal evolution of international development cooperation. Expert interviews further suggest how these insights can empower policymakers with data-driven decision-making tools, ultimately improving aid effectiveness and supporting progress toward SDGs."
2505.15466,"AI-based technologies have significant potential to enhance inclusive education and clinical-rehabilitative contexts for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities. AI can enhance learning experiences, empower students, and support both teachers and rehabilitators. However, their usage presents challenges that require a systemic-ecological vision, ethical considerations, and participatory research. Therefore, research and technological development must be rooted in a strong ethical-theoretical framework. The Capability Approach - a theoretical model of disability, human vulnerability, and inclusion - offers a more relevant perspective on functionality, effectiveness, and technological adequacy in inclusive learning environments. In this paper, we propose a participatory research strategy with different stakeholders through a case study on the ARTIS Project, which develops an AI-enriched interface to support children with text comprehension difficulties. Our research strategy integrates ethical, educational, clinical, and technological expertise in designing and implementing AI-based technologies for children's learning environments through focus groups and collaborative design sessions. We believe that this holistic approach to AI adoption in education can help bridge the gap between technological innovation and ethical responsibility."
2505.15799,"Generative AI has transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural language interfaces and the emergence of autonomous agents capable of acting on users' behalf. While early applications have improved individual productivity, these gains have largely been confined to predefined tasks within existing workflows. We argue that the more profound economic impact lies in reducing communication frictions between consumers and businesses. This shift could reorganize markets, redistribute power, and catalyze the creation of new products and services. We explore the implications of an agentic economy, where assistant agents act on behalf of consumers and service agents represent businesses, interacting programmatically to facilitate transactions. A key distinction we draw is between unscripted interactions -- enabled by technical advances in natural language and protocol design -- and unrestricted interactions, which depend on market structures and governance. We examine the current limitations of siloed and end-to-end agents, and explore future scenarios shaped by technical standards and market dynamics. These include the potential tension between agentic walled gardens and an open web of agents, implications for advertising and discovery, the evolution of micro-transactions, and the unbundling and rebundling of digital goods. Ultimately, we argue that the architecture of agentic communication will determine the extent to which generative AI democratizes access to economic opportunity."
2505.15851,"This paper elaborates on the concept of moral exercises as a means to help AI actors cultivate virtues that enable effective human oversight of AI systems. We explore the conceptual framework and significance of moral exercises, situating them within the contexts of philosophical discourse, ancient practices, and contemporary AI ethics scholarship. We outline the core pillars of the moral exercises methodology - eliciting an engaged personal disposition, fostering relational understanding, and cultivating technomoral wisdom - and emphasize their relevance to key activities and competencies essential for human oversight of AI systems. Our argument is supported by findings from three pilot studies involving a company, a multidisciplinary team of AI researchers, and higher education students. These studies allow us to explore both the potential and the limitations of moral exercises. Based on the collected data, we offer insights into how moral exercises can foster a responsible AI culture within organizations, and suggest directions for future research."
2505.16274,"This study investigates the emotional rhythms and behavioral mechanisms of dominant political leaders in strategic decision-making. Using the Trump administration's 125 percent tariff hike on China as a case, it adopts a Multimodal Cognitive Behavioral Modeling framework. This includes micro-expression tracking, acoustic intonation analysis, semantic flow modeling, cognitive load simulation, and strategic behavior mapping to construct a full-cycle simulation of emotion, motivation, and output. Results reveal that Trump's decisions are not driven by rational deduction, but emerge from dominance-coherence rhythms. A six-axis National Strategic Tempo Intervention Framework is proposed to support anticipatory policy modeling."
2505.16413,"Government transparency, widely recognized as a cornerstone of open government, depends on robust information management practices. Yet effective assessment of information management remains challenging, as existing methods fail to consider the actual working behavior of civil servants and are resource-intensive. Using a design science research approach, we present the Transparency Anti-Pattern Assessment System (TAPAS) -- a novel, data-driven methodology designed to evaluate government transparency through the identification of behavioral patterns that impede transparency. We demonstrate TAPAS's real-world applicability at a Dutch ministry, analyzing their electronic document management system data from the past two decades. We identify eight transparency anti-patterns grouped into four categories: Incomplete Documentation, Limited Accessibility, Unclear Information, and Delayed Documentation. We show that TAPAS enables continuous monitoring and provides actionable insights without requiring significant resource investments."
2505.16946,"This study analyzes tract-level real estate ownership patterns in New York State (NYS) and New York City (NYC) to uncover racial disparities. We use an advanced race/ethnicity imputation model (LSTM+Geo with XGBoost filtering, validated at 89.2% accuracy) to compare the predicted racial composition of property owners to the resident population from census data. We examine both a Full Model (statewide) and a Name-Only LSTM Model (NYC) to assess how incorporating geospatial context affects our predictions and disparity estimates. The results reveal significant inequities: White individuals hold a disproportionate share of properties and property value relative to their population, while Black, Hispanic, and Asian communities are underrepresented as property owners. These disparities are most pronounced in minority-majority neighborhoods, where ownership is predominantly White despite a predominantly non-White population. Corporate ownership (LLCs, trusts, etc.) exacerbates these gaps by reducing owner-occupied opportunities in urban minority communities. We provide a breakdown of ownership vs. population by race for majority-White, -Black, -Hispanic, and -Asian tracts, identify those with extreme ownership disparities, and compare patterns in urban, suburban, and rural contexts. The findings underscore persistent racial inequity in property ownership, reflecting broader historical and socio-economic forces, and highlight the importance of data-driven approaches to address these issues."
2505.17041,"Generative Artificial Intelligence is transforming how English as a foreign language students write. Still, little is known about how students manipulate text generated by generative AI during the writing process. This study investigates how EFL secondary school students integrate and modify AI-generated text when completing an expository writing task. The study employed an exploratory mixed-methods design. Screen recordings were collected from 29 Hong Kong secondary school students who attended an AI-assisted writing workshop and recorded their screens while using generative AI to write an article. Content analysis with hierarchical coding and thematic analysis with a multiple case study approach were adopted to analyze the recordings. 15 types of AI-generated text edits across seven categories were identified from the recordings. Notably, AI-initiated edits from iOS and Google Docs emerged as unanticipated sources of AI-generated text. A thematic analysis revealed four patterns of students' editing behaviors based on planning and drafting direction: planning with top-down drafting and revising; top-down drafting and revising without planning; planning with bottom-up drafting and revising; and bottom-up drafting and revising without planning. Network graphs illustrate cases of each pattern, demonstrating that students' interactions with AI-generated text involve more complex cognitive processes than simple text insertion. The findings challenge assumptions about students' passive, simplistic use of generative AI tools and have implications for developing explicit instructional approaches to teaching AI-generated text editing strategies in the AFL writing pedagogy."
2505.17105,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an essential role in healthcare and is pervasively incorporated into medical software and equipment. In the European Union, healthcare is a high-risk application domain for AI, and providers must prepare Instructions for Use (IFU) according to the European regulation 2024/1689 (AI Act). To this regulation, the principle of transparency is cardinal and requires the IFU to be clear and relevant to the users. This study tests whether these latter requirements are satisfied by the IFU structure. A survey was administered online via the Qualtrics platform to four types of direct stakeholders, i.e., managers (N = 238), healthcare professionals (N = 115), patients (N = 229), and Information Technology experts (N = 230). The participants rated the relevance of a set of transparency needs and indicated the IFU section addressing them. The results reveal differentiated priorities across stakeholders and a troubled mapping of transparency needs onto the IFU structure. Recommendations to build a locally meaningful IFU are derived."
2505.17128,"This study is part of a larger project focused on measuring, understanding, and improving student engagement in programming education. We investigate whether synthetic data generation can help identify at-risk students earlier in a small, imbalanced dataset from an introductory programming module. The analysis used anonymised records from 379 students, with 15\% marked as failing, and applied several machine learning algorithms. The first experiments showed poor recall for the failing group. However, using synthetic data generation methods led to a significant improvement in performance. Our results suggest that machine learning can help identify at-risk students early in programming courses when combined with synthetic data. This research lays the groundwork for validating and using these models with live student cohorts in the future, to allow for timely and effective interventions that can improve student outcomes. It also includes feature importance analysis to refine formative tasks. Overall, this study contributes to developing practical workflows that help detect disengagement early and improve student success in programming education."
2505.17141,"The fashion industry is an extremely profitable market that generates trillions of dollars in revenue by producing and distributing apparel, footwear, and accessories. This systematic literature review (SLR) seeks to systematically review and analyze the research landscape about the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and metaverse in the fashion industry. Thus, investigating the impact of integrating both technologies to enhance the fashion industry. This systematic review uses the Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, including three essential phases: identification, evaluation, and reporting. In the identification phase, the target search problems are determined by selecting appropriate keywords and alternative synonyms. After that 578 documents from 2014 to the end of 2023 are retrieved. The evaluation phase applies three screening steps to assess papers and choose 118 eligible papers for full-text reading. Finally, the reporting phase thoroughly examines and synthesizes the 118 eligible papers to identify key themes associated with GAI and Metaverse in the fashion industry. Based on Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analyses performed for both GAI and metaverse for the fashion industry, it is concluded that the integration of GAI and the metaverse holds the capacity to profoundly revolutionize the fashion sector, presenting chances for improved manufacturing, design, sales, and client experiences. Accordingly, the research proposes a new framework to integrate GAI and metaverse to enhance the fashion industry. The framework presents different use cases to promote the fashion industry using the integration. Future research points for achieving a successful integration are demonstrated."
2505.17143,"Evaluating the performance of a lecturer has been essential for enhancing teaching quality, improving student learning outcomes, and strengthening the institution's reputation. The absence of such a system brings about lecturer performance evaluation which was neither comprehensive nor holistic. This system was designed using a web-based platform, created a secure database, and by using a custom dataset, captured some performance metrics which included student evaluation scores, Research Publications, Years of Experience, and Administrative Duties. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm was utilized due to its ability to process complex data patterns and generates accurate predictions in a lecturer's performance based on historical data. This research focused on designing multiple performance metrics beyond the standard ones, incorporating student participation, and integrating analytical tools to deliver a comprehensive and holistic evaluation of lecturers' performance and was developed using Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) methodology. Lecturers' performance is evaluated by the model, and the evaluation accuracy is about 91% compared with actual performance. Finally, by evaluating the performance of the MLP model, it is concluded that MLP enhanced lecturer performance evaluation by providing accurate predictions, reducing bias, and supporting data-driven decisions, ultimately improving the fairness and efficiency of the evaluation process. The MLP model's performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), achieved a test loss (MSE) of 256.99 and a MAE of 13.76, and reflected a high level of prediction accuracy. The model also demonstrated an estimated accuracy rate of approximately 96%, validated its effectiveness in predicting lecturer performance."
2505.17165,"The introduction of the AI Act in the European Union presents the AI research and practice community with a set of new challenges related to compliance. While it is certain that AI practitioners will require additional guidance and tools to meet these requirements, previous research on toolkits that aim to translate the theory of AI ethics into development and deployment practice suggests that such resources suffer from multiple limitations. These limitations stem, in part, from the fact that the toolkits are either produced by industry-based teams or by academics whose work tends to be abstract and divorced from the realities of industry. In this paper, we discuss the challenge of developing an AI ethics toolkit for practitioners that helps them comply with new AI-focused regulation, but that also moves beyond mere compliance to consider broader socio-ethical questions throughout development and deployment. The toolkit was created through a cross-sectoral collaboration between an academic team based in the UK and an industry team in Italy. We outline the background and rationale for creating a pro-justice AI Act compliance toolkit, detail the process undertaken to develop it, and describe the collaboration and negotiation efforts that shaped its creation. We aim for the described process to serve as a blueprint for other teams navigating the challenges of academia-industry partnerships and aspiring to produce usable and meaningful AI ethics resources."
2505.17479,"LLM-based digital twin simulation, where large language models are used to emulate individual human behavior, holds great promise for research in AI, social science, and digital experimentation. However, progress in this area has been hindered by the scarcity of real, individual-level datasets that are both large and publicly available. This lack of high-quality ground truth limits both the development and validation of digital twin methodologies. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale, public dataset designed to capture a rich and holistic view of individual human behavior. We survey a representative sample of $N = 2,058$ participants (average 2.42 hours per person) in the US across four waves with 500 questions in total, covering a comprehensive battery of demographic, psychological, economic, personality, and cognitive measures, as well as replications of behavioral economics experiments and a pricing survey. The final wave repeats tasks from earlier waves to establish a test-retest accuracy baseline. Initial analyses suggest the data are of high quality and show promise for constructing digital twins that predict human behavior well at the individual and aggregate levels. By making the full dataset publicly available, we aim to establish a valuable testbed for the development and benchmarking of LLM-based persona simulations. Beyond LLM applications, due to its unique breadth and scale the dataset also enables broad social science research, including studies of cross-construct correlations and heterogeneous treatment effects."
2505.17841,"Dataset transparency is a key enabler of responsible AI, but insights into multimodal dataset attributes that impact trustworthy and ethical aspects of AI applications remain scarce and are difficult to compare across datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce Trustworthy and Ethical Dataset Indicators (TEDI) that facilitate the systematic, empirical analysis of dataset documentation. TEDI encompasses 143 fine-grained indicators that characterize trustworthy and ethical attributes of multimodal datasets and their collection processes. The indicators are framed to extract verifiable information from dataset documentation. Using TEDI, we manually annotated and analyzed over 100 multimodal datasets that include human voices. We further annotated data sourcing, size, and modality details to gain insights into the factors that shape trustworthy and ethical dimensions across datasets. We find that only a select few datasets have documented attributes and practices pertaining to consent, privacy, and harmful content indicators. The extent to which these and other ethical indicators are addressed varies based on the data collection method, with documentation of datasets collected via crowdsourced and direct collection approaches being more likely to mention them. Scraping dominates scale at the cost of ethical indicators, but is not the only viable collection method. Our approach and empirical insights contribute to increasing dataset transparency along trustworthy and ethical dimensions and pave the way for automating the tedious task of extracting information from dataset documentation in future."
2505.17864,"The 3R-based Zero Waste approach aims to minimize household solid waste through the principles of Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. This study examines the relationship between household environmental knowledge, personal attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control as key behavioral predictors. A structured survey was conducted among 1,200 urban households across 12 Indonesian cities. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis. The results indicate that perceived behavioral control is the strongest predictor of household waste management behavior (beta = 0.367, p <= 0.001), followed by subjective norms (beta = 0.358, p <= 0.001) and environmental knowledge (beta = 0.126, p <= 0.001). This suggests that individuals' confidence in managing household waste significantly influences their practical actions. Overall, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and environmental knowledge contribute to Zero Waste behavior in urban households. Given that households regularly generate and dispose of waste, they represent a fundamental element in municipal waste management strategies. These findings offer valuable insights for designing behavior-based interventions and inform policy development using the Theory of Planned Behavior."
2505.18006,"Legal AI systems are increasingly being adopted by judicial and legal system deployers and providers worldwide to support a range of applications. While they offer potential benefits such as reducing bias, increasing efficiency, and improving accountability, they also pose significant risks, requiring a careful balance between opportunities, and legal and ethical development and deployment. AI literacy, as a legal requirement under the EU AI Act and a critical enabler of ethical AI for deployers and providers, could be a tool to achieve this. The article introduces the term ""legal AI systems"" and then analyzes the concept of AI literacy and the benefits and risks associated with these systems. This analysis is linked to a broader AI-L concept for organizations that deal with legal AI systems. The outcome of the article, a roadmap questionnaire as a practical tool for developers and providers to assess risks, benefits, and stakeholder concerns, could be useful in meeting societal and regulatory expectations for legal AI."
2505.18212,"Despite their staggering capabilities as assistant tools, often exceeding human performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) are still prone to jailbreak attempts from malevolent users. Although red teaming practices have already identified and helped to address several such jailbreak techniques, one particular sturdy approach involving role-playing (which we named `Goofy Game') seems effective against most of the current LLMs safeguards. This can result in the provision of unsafe content, which, although not harmful per se, might lead to dangerous consequences if delivered in a setting such as the medical domain. In this preliminary and exploratory study, we provide an initial analysis of how, even without technical knowledge of the internal architecture and parameters of generative AI models, a malicious user could construct a role-playing prompt capable of coercing an LLM into producing incorrect (and potentially harmful) clinical suggestions. We aim to illustrate a specific vulnerability scenario, providing insights that can support future advancements in the field."
2505.18213,"AI Data Readiness Inspector (AIDRIN) is a framework to evaluate and improve data preparedness for AI applications. It addresses critical data readiness dimensions such as data quality, bias, fairness, and privacy. This paper details enhancements to AIDRIN by focusing on user interface improvements and integration with a privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) framework. By refining the UI and enabling smooth integration with decentralized AI pipelines, AIDRIN becomes more accessible and practical for users with varying technical expertise. Integrating with an existing PPFL framework ensures that data readiness and privacy are prioritized in federated learning environments. A case study involving a real-world dataset demonstrates AIDRIN's practical value in identifying data readiness issues that impact AI model performance."
2505.1822,"The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues in education. This study examines the use of LLMs in supporting learning in machine learning education; in particular, it focuses on the ability of LLMs to identify common errors of practice (pitfalls) in machine learning code, and their ability to provide feedback that can guide learning. Using a portfolio of code samples, we consider four different LLMs: one closed model and three open models. Whilst the most basic pitfalls are readily identified by all models, many common pitfalls are not. They particularly struggle to identify pitfalls in the early stages of the ML pipeline, especially those which can lead to information leaks, a major source of failure within applied ML projects. They also exhibit limited success at identifying pitfalls around model selection, which is a concept that students often struggle with when first transitioning from theory to practice. This questions the use of current LLMs to support machine learning education, and also raises important questions about their use by novice practitioners. Nevertheless, when LLMs successfully identify pitfalls in code, they do provide feedback that includes advice on how to proceed, emphasising their potential role in guiding learners. We also compare the capability of closed and open LLM models, and find that the gap is relatively small given the large difference in model sizes. This presents an opportunity to deploy, and potentially customise, smaller more efficient LLM models within education, avoiding risks around cost and data sharing associated with commercial models."
2505.18236,"Bias in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) models has been documented, yet the evidence is scattered across narrowly focused studies. We synthesize this fragmented literature to provide a concise overview of bias in GeoAI and examine how the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) shapes audit obligations. We discuss recurring bias mechanisms, including representation, algorithmic and aggregation bias, and map them to specific provisions of the EU AI Act. By applying the Act's high-risk criteria, we demonstrate that widely deployed GeoAI applications qualify as high-risk systems. We then present examples of recent audits along with an outline of practical methods for detecting bias. As far as we know, this study represents the first integration of GeoAI bias evidence into the EU AI Act context, by identifying high-risk GeoAI systems and mapping bias mechanisms to the Act's Articles. Although the analysis is exploratory, it suggests that even well-curated European datasets should employ routine bias audits before 2027, when the AI Act's high-risk provisions take full effect."
2505.18246,"Objective: Large language models (LLMs) are attracting increasing interest in healthcare. This commentary evaluates the potential of LLMs to improve clinical prediction models (CPMs) for diagnostic and prognostic tasks, with a focus on their ability to process longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data.Findings: LLMs show promise in handling multimodal and longitudinal EHR data and can support multi-outcome predictions for diverse health conditions. However, methodological, validation, infrastructural, and regulatory chal- lenges remain. These include inadequate methods for time-to-event modelling, poor calibration of predictions, limited external validation, and bias affecting underrepresented groups. High infrastructure costs and the absence of clear regulatory frameworks further prevent adoption.Implications: Further work and interdisciplinary collaboration are needed to support equitable and effective integra- tion into the clinical prediction. Developing temporally aware, fair, and explainable models should be a priority focus for transforming clinical prediction workflow."
2505.18326,"Older immigrant adults often face layered barriers to digital participation, including language exclusion, generational divides, and emotional fatigue. This study examines how older Korean immigrants in the greater NYC area selectively engage with digital tools such as smartphones, YouTube, and AI platforms. Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) framework and 22 semi-structured interviews, we identify two key practices: pragmatic disengagement, where users avoid emotionally taxing or culturally misaligned content, and interdependent navigation, where digital use is shaped through reliance on family or community support. These strategies challenge deficit-oriented narratives of non-use, showing how disengagement can be thoughtful, protective, and culturally situated. We contribute to CSCW by expanding theories of non-use and algorithmic resistance and by offering design and policy recommendations to support more dignified, culturally attuned digital engagement for aging immigrant populations."
2505.18371,"Military weapon systems and command-and-control infrastructure augmented by artificial intelligence (AI) have seen rapid development and deployment in recent years. However, the sociotechnical impacts of AI on combat systems, military decision-making, and the norms of warfare have been understudied. We focus on a specific subset of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) that use AI for targeting or battlefield decisions. We refer to this subset as AI-powered lethal autonomous weapon systems (AI-LAWS) and argue that they introduce novel risks -- including unanticipated escalation, poor reliability in unfamiliar environments, and erosion of human oversight -- all of which threaten both military effectiveness and the openness of AI research. These risks cannot be addressed by high-level policy alone; effective regulation must be grounded in the technical behavior of AI models. We argue that AI researchers must be involved throughout the regulatory lifecycle. Thus, we propose a clear, behavior-based definition of AI-LAWS -- systems that introduce unique risks through their use of modern AI -- as a foundation for technically grounded regulation, given that existing frameworks do not distinguish them from conventional LAWS. Using this definition, we propose several technically-informed policy directions and invite greater participation from the AI research community in military AI policy discussions."
2505.18422,"According to several empirical investigations, despite enhancing human capabilities, human-AI cooperation frequently falls short of expectations and fails to reach true synergy. We propose a task-driven framework that reverses prevalent approaches by assigning AI roles according to how the task's requirements align with the capabilities of AI technology. Three major AI roles are identified through task analysis across risk and complexity dimensions: autonomous, assistive/collaborative, and adversarial. We show how proper human-AI integration maintains meaningful agency while improving performance by methodically mapping these roles to various task types based on current empirical findings. This framework lays the foundation for practically effective and morally sound human-AI collaboration that unleashes human potential by aligning task attributes to AI capabilities. It also provides structured guidance for context-sensitive automation that complements human strengths rather than replacing human judgment."
2505.18523,"Growing awareness of social biases and inequalities embedded in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has brought increased attention to the integration of Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) principles throughout the AI lifecycle. Despite the rise of ethical AI guidelines, there is limited empirical evidence on how D&I is applied in real-world settings. This study explores how AI and Machine Learning(ML) practitioners perceive and implement D&I principles and identifies organisational challenges that hinder their effective adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, we surveyed industry professionals, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data on current practices, perceived impacts, and challenges related to D&I in AI. While most respondents recognise D&I as essential for mitigating bias and enhancing fairness, practical implementation remains inconsistent. Our analysis revealed a disconnect between perceived benefits and current practices, with major barriers including the under-representation of marginalised groups, lack of organisational transparency, and limited awareness among early-career professionals. Despite these barriers, respondents widely agree that diverse teams contribute to ethical, trustworthy, and innovative AI systems. By underpinning the key pain points and areas requiring improvement, this study highlights the need to bridge the gap between D&I principles and real-world AI development practices."
2505.18552,"The study of vernacular architecture involves recording, ordering, and analysing buildings to probe their physical, social, and cultural explanations. Traditionally, this process is conducted manually and intuitively by researchers. Because human perception is selective and often partial, the resulting interpretations of architecture are invariably broad and loose, often lingering on form descriptions that adhere to a preset linear historical progression or crude regional demarcations. This study proposes a research framework by which intelligent technologies can be systematically assembled to augment researchers' intuition in mapping or uncovering the genealogy of vernacular architecture and its connotative socio-cultural system. We employ this framework to examine the stylistic classification of 1,277 historical shophouses in Singapore's Chinatown. Findings extend beyond the chronological classification established by the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore in the 1980s and 1990s, presenting instead a phylogenetic network to capture the formal evolution of shophouses across time and space. The network organises the shophouse types into nine distinct clusters, revealing concurrent evidences of cultural evolution and diffusion. Moreover, it provides a critical perspective on the multi-ethnic character of Singapore shophouses by suggesting that the distinct cultural influences of different ethnic groups led to a pattern of parallel evolution rather than direct convergence. Our work advances a quantitative genealogy of vernacular architecture, which not only assists in formal description but also reveals the underlying forces of development and change. It also exemplified the potential of collaboration between studies in vernacular architecture and computer science, demonstrating how leveraging the strengths of both fields can yield remarkable insights."
2505.18779,"Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as AI Assistants in firms for support in cognitive tasks. These AI assistants carry embedded perspectives which influence factors across the firm including decision-making, collaboration, and organizational culture. This paper argues that firms must align the perspectives of these AI Assistants intentionally with their objectives and values, framing alignment as a strategic and ethical imperative crucial for maintaining control over firm culture and intra-firm moral norms. The paper highlights how AI perspectives arise from biases in training data and the fine-tuning objectives of developers, and discusses their impact and ethical significance, foregrounding ethical concerns like automation bias and reduced critical thinking. Drawing on normative business ethics, particularly non-reductionist views of professional relationships, three distinct alignment strategies are proposed: supportive (reinforcing the firm's mission), adversarial (stress-testing ideas), and diverse (broadening moral horizons by incorporating multiple stakeholder views). The ethical trade-offs of each strategy and their implications for manager-employee and employee-employee relationships are analyzed, alongside the potential to shape the culture and moral fabric of the firm."
2505.18882,"Large language models (LLMs) typically generate identical or similar responses for all users given the same prompt, posing serious safety risks in high-stakes applications where user vulnerabilities differ widely. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics - such as factuality, bias, or toxicity - overlooking the fact that the same response may carry divergent risks depending on the user's background or condition. We introduce personalized safety to fill this gap and present PENGUIN - a benchmark comprising 14,000 scenarios across seven sensitive domains with both context-rich and context-free variants. Evaluating six leading LLMs, we demonstrate that personalized user information significantly improves safety scores by 43.2%, confirming the effectiveness of personalization in safety alignment. However, not all context attributes contribute equally to safety enhancement. To address this, we develop RAISE - a training-free, two-stage agent framework that strategically acquires user-specific background. RAISE improves safety scores by up to 31.6% over six vanilla LLMs, while maintaining a low interaction cost of just 2.7 user queries on average. Our findings highlight the importance of selective information gathering in safety-critical domains and offer a practical solution for personalizing LLM responses without model retraining. This work establishes a foundation for safety research that adapts to individual user contexts rather than assuming a universal harm standard."
2505.18892,"Climate implications of rapidly developing digital technologies, such as blockchains and the associated crypto mining and NFT minting, have been well documented and their massive GPU energy use has been identified as a cause for concern. However, we postulate that due to their more mainstream consumer appeal, the GPU use of text-prompt based diffusion AI art systems also requires thoughtful considerations. Given the recent explosion in the number of highly sophisticated generative art systems and their rapid adoption by consumers and creative professionals, the impact of these systems on the climate needs to be carefully considered. In this work, we report on the growth of diffusion-based visual AI systems, their patterns of use, growth and the implications on the climate. Our estimates show that the mass adoption of these tools potentially contributes considerably to global energy consumption. We end this paper with our thoughts on solutions and future areas of inquiry as well as associated difficulties, including the lack of publicly available data."
2505.18893,"Conventional AI evaluation approaches concentrated within the AI stack exhibit systemic limitations for exploring, navigating and resolving the human and societal factors that play out in real world deployment such as in education, finance, healthcare, and employment sectors. AI capability evaluations can capture detail about first-order effects, such as whether immediate system outputs are accurate, or contain toxic, biased or stereotypical content, but AI's second-order effects, i.e. any long-term outcomes and consequences that may result from AI use in the real world, have become a significant area of interest as the technology becomes embedded in our daily lives. These secondary effects can include shifts in user behavior, societal, cultural and economic ramifications, workforce transformations, and long-term downstream impacts that may result from a broad and growing set of risks. This position paper argues that measuring the indirect and secondary effects of AI will require expansion beyond static, single-turn approaches conducted in silico to include testing paradigms that can capture what actually materializes when people use AI technology in context. Specifically, we describe the need for data and methods that can facilitate contextual awareness and enable downstream interpretation and decision making about AI's secondary effects, and recommend requirements for a new ecosystem."
2505.18938,"The introduction of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT into creative workplaces has sparked highly visible, but binary worker replacement and augmentation debates. This study reframes this argument by examining how creative professionals re-specify a division of labor with these tools. Through 17 ethnomethodologically informed interviews with international creative agency workers we demonstrate how roles are assigned to generative AI tools, how their contributions are modified and remediated, and how workers practically manage their outputs to reflect assumptions of internal and external stakeholders. This paper makes 3 unique contributions to CSCW: (1) we conceptualize generative AI prompting as a type of workplace situated, reflexive delegation, (2) we demonstrate that workers must continuously configure and repair AI role boundaries to maintain workplace intelligibility and accountability; and (3) we introduce the notion of interpretive templatized trust, where workers devise strategies to adapt automated generative templates for their setting, and reinforce stakeholder trust. This contribution has implications for organizing productive human-AI work in creative and stakeholder centric environments."
2505.18942,"This paper calls on the research community not only to investigate how human biases are inherited by large language models (LLMs) but also to explore how these biases in LLMs can be leveraged to make society's ""unwritten code"" - such as implicit stereotypes and heuristics - visible and accessible for critique. We introduce a conceptual framework through a case study in science: uncovering hidden rules in peer review - the factors that reviewers care about but rarely state explicitly due to normative scientific expectations. The idea of the framework is to push LLMs to speak out their heuristics through generating self-consistent hypotheses - why one paper appeared stronger in reviewer scoring - among paired papers submitted to 45 academic conferences, while iteratively searching deeper hypotheses from remaining pairs where existing hypotheses cannot explain. We observed that LLMs' normative priors about the internal characteristics of good science extracted from their self-talk, e.g., theoretical rigor, were systematically updated toward posteriors that emphasize storytelling about external connections, such as how the work is positioned and connected within and across literatures. Human reviewers tend to explicitly reward aspects that moderately align with LLMs' normative priors (correlation = 0.49) but avoid articulating contextualization and storytelling posteriors in their review comments (correlation = -0.14), despite giving implicit reward to them with positive scores. These patterns are robust across different models and out-of-sample judgments. We discuss the broad applicability of our proposed framework, leveraging LLMs as diagnostic tools to amplify and surface the tacit codes underlying human society, enabling public discussion of revealed values and more precisely targeted responsible AI."
2505.19558,"Achieving political consensus is crucial yet challenging for the effective functioning of social governance. However, although frontier AI systems represented by large language models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, their capabilities in this scope are still understudied. In this paper, we introduce PoliCon, a novel benchmark constructed from 2,225 high-quality deliberation records of the European Parliament over 13 years, ranging from 2009 to 2022, to evaluate the ability of LLMs to draft consensus resolutions based on divergent party positions under varying collective decision-making contexts and political requirements. Specifically, PoliCon incorporates four factors to build each task environment for finding different political consensus: specific political issues, political goals, participating parties, and power structures based on seat distribution. We also developed an evaluation framework based on social choice theory for PoliCon, which simulates the real voting outcomes of different political parties to assess whether LLM-generated resolutions meet the requirements of the predetermined political consensus. Our experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models remain undersatisfied with complex tasks like passing resolutions by a two-thirds majority and addressing security issues, while uncovering their inherent partisan biases and revealing some behaviors LLMs show to achieve the consensus, such as prioritizing the stance of the dominant party instead of uniting smaller parties, which highlights PoliCon's promise as an effective platform for studying LLMs' ability to promote political consensus."
2505.20181,"The increasing deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other autonomous algorithmic systems presents the world with new systemic risks. While focus often lies on the function of individual algorithms, a critical and underestimated danger arises from their interactions, particularly when algorithmic systems operate without awareness of each other, or when those deploying them are unaware of the full algorithmic ecosystem deployment is occurring in. These interactions can lead to unforeseen, rapidly escalating negative outcomes - from market crashes and energy supply disruptions to potential physical accidents and erosion of public trust - often exceeding the human capacity for effective monitoring and the legal capacities for proper intervention. Current governance frameworks are inadequate as they lack visibility into this complex ecosystem of interactions. This paper outlines the nature of this challenge and proposes some initial policy suggestions centered on increasing transparency and accountability through phased system registration, a licensing framework for deployment, and enhanced monitoring capabilities."
2505.20304,"This paper introduces LoBOX (Lack of Belief: Opacity \& eXplainability) governance ethic structured framework for managing artificial intelligence (AI) opacity when full transparency is infeasible. Rather than treating opacity as a design flaw, LoBOX defines it as a condition that can be ethically governed through role-calibrated explanation and institutional accountability. The framework comprises a three-stage pathway: reduce accidental opacity, bound irreducible opacity, and delegate trust through structured oversight. Integrating the RED/BLUE XAI model for stakeholder-sensitive explanation and aligned with emerging legal instruments such as the EU AI Act, LoBOX offers a scalable and context-aware alternative to transparency-centric approaches. Reframe trust not as a function of complete system explainability, but as an outcome of institutional credibility, structured justification, and stakeholder-responsive accountability. A governance loop cycles back to ensure that LoBOX remains responsive to evolving technological contexts and stakeholder expectations, to ensure the complete opacity governance. We move from transparency ideals to ethical governance, emphasizing that trustworthiness in AI must be institutionally grounded and contextually justified. We also discuss how cultural or institutional trust varies in different contexts. This theoretical framework positions opacity not as a flaw but as a feature that must be actively governed to ensure responsible AI systems."
2505.20305,"As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as healthcare, law, and education, the demand for transparent, interpretable, and accountable AI systems becomes more urgent. Explainable AI (XAI) acts as a crucial interface between the opaque reasoning of LLMs and the diverse stakeholders who rely on their outputs in high-risk decisions. This paper presents a comprehensive reflection and survey of XAI for LLMs, framed around three guiding questions: Why is explainability essential? What technical and ethical dimensions does it entail? And how can it fulfill its role in real-world deployment?We highlight four core dimensions central to explainability in LLMs, faithfulness, truthfulness, plausibility, and contrastivity, which together expose key design tensions and guide the development of explanation strategies that are both technically sound and contextually appropriate. The paper discusses how XAI can support epistemic clarity, regulatory compliance, and audience-specific intelligibility across stakeholder roles and decision settings.We further examine how explainability is evaluated, alongside emerging developments in audience-sensitive XAI, mechanistic interpretability, causal reasoning, and adaptive explanation systems. Emphasizing the shift from surface-level transparency to governance-ready design, we identify critical challenges and future research directions for ensuring the responsible use of LLMs in complex societal contexts. We argue that explainability must evolve into a civic infrastructure fostering trust, enabling contestability, and aligning AI systems with institutional accountability and human-centered decision-making."
2505.20311,"Explainable AI (XAI) is a promising solution to ensure compliance with the EU AI Act, the first multi-national regulation for AI. XAI aims to enhance transparency and human oversight of AI systems, particularly ``black-box models'', which are criticized as incomprehensible. However, the discourse around the main stakeholders in the AI Act and XAI appears disconnected. While XAI prioritizes the end user's needs as the primary goal, the AI Act focuses on the obligations of the provider and deployer of the AI system. We aim to bridge this divide and provide guidance on how these two worlds are related. By fostering an interdisciplinary discussion in a cross-functional team with XAI, AI Act, legal, and requirements engineering experts, we walk through the steps necessary to analyze an AI-based clinical decision support system to clarify the end-user needs and assess AI Act applicability. By analyzing our justified understanding using an AI system under development as a case, we show that XAI techniques can fill a gap between stakeholder needs and the requirements of the AI Act. We look at the similarities and contrasts between the legal requirements and the needs of stakeholders. In doing so, we encourage researchers and practitioners from the XAI community to reflect on their role towards the AI Act by achieving a mutual understanding of the implications of XAI and the AI Act within different disciplines."
2505.20312,"During job recruitment, traditional applicant selection methods often lack transparency. Candidates are rarely given sufficient justifications for recruiting decisions, whether they are made manually by human recruiters or through the use of black-box Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). To address this problem, our work introduces a multi-agent AI system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide job seekers during the recruitment process. Using an iterative user-centric design approach, we first conducted a two-phased exploratory study with four active job seekers to inform the design and development of the system. Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth, qualitative user study with 20 active job seekers through individual one-to-one interviews to evaluate the developed prototype. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that participants perceived our multi-agent recruitment system as significantly more actionable, trustworthy, and fair compared to traditional methods. Our study further helped us uncover in-depth insights into factors contributing to these perceived user experiences. Drawing from these insights, we offer broader design implications for building user-aligned, multi-agent explainable AI systems across diverse domains."
2505.20326,"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse cultural contexts, yet their internal biases remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose a novel framework to systematically evaluate how VLMs encode cultural differences and biases related to race, gender, and physical traits across countries. We introduce three retrieval-based tasks: (1) Race to Country retrieval, which examines the association between individuals from specific racial groups (East Asian, White, Middle Eastern, Latino, South Asian, and Black) and different countries; (2) Personal Traits to Country retrieval, where images are paired with trait-based prompts (e.g., Smart, Honest, Criminal, Violent) to investigate potential stereotypical associations; and (3) Physical Characteristics to Country retrieval, focusing on visual attributes like skinny, young, obese, and old to explore how physical appearances are culturally linked to nations. Our findings reveal persistent biases in VLMs, highlighting how visual representations may inadvertently reinforce societal stereotypes."
2505.20329,"The increasing demand for digital literacy and artificial intelligence (AI) fluency in the workforce has highlighted the need for scalable, efficient programming instruction. This study evaluates the effectiveness of integrating generative AI, specifically OpenAIs ChatGPT, into a self-paced Python programming module embedded within a sixteen-week professional training course on applied generative AI. A total of 86 adult learners with varying levels of programming experience completed asynchronous Python instruction in Weeks three and four, using ChatGPT to generate, interpret, and debug code. Python proficiency and general coding knowledge was assessed across 30 different assessments during the first 13 weeks of the course through timed, code-based evaluations. A mixed-design ANOVA revealed that learners without prior programming experience scored significantly lower than their peers on early assessments. However, following the completion of the accelerated Python instruction module, these group differences were no longer statistically significant,, indicating that the intervention effectively closed initial performance gaps and supported proficiency gains across all learner groups. These findings suggest that generative AI can support accelerated learning outcomes and reduce entry barriers for learners with no prior coding background. While ChatGPT effectively facilitated foundational skill acquisition, the study also highlights the importance of balancing AI assistance with opportunities for independent problem-solving. The results support the potential of AI-augmented instruction as a scalable model for reskilling in the digital economy."
2505.21016,"This study examines how Reddit users engaged with the racial narratives of Lovecraft Country and Watchmen, two television series that reimagine historical racial trauma. Drawing on narrative persuasion and multistep flow theory, we analyze 3,879 Reddit comments using topic modeling and critical discourse analysis. We identify three dynamic social roles advocates, adversaries, and adaptives and explore how users move between them in response to racial discourse. Findings reveal how Reddits pseudonymous affordances shape role fluidity, opinion leadership, and moral engagement. While adversaries minimized or rejected racism as exaggerated, advocates shared standpoint experiences and historical resources to challenge these claims. Adaptive users shifted perspectives over time, demonstrating how online publics can foster critical racial learning. This research highlights how popular culture and participatory platforms intersect in shaping collective meaning making around race and historical memory."
2505.21091,"System prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs) are predefined directives that guide model behaviour, taking precedence over user inputs in text processing and generation. LLM deployers increasingly use them to ensure consistent responses across contexts. While model providers set a foundation of system prompts, deployers and third-party developers can append additional prompts without visibility into others' additions, while this layered implementation remains entirely hidden from end-users. As system prompts become more complex, they can directly or indirectly introduce unaccounted for side effects. This lack of transparency raises fundamental questions about how the position of information in different directives shapes model outputs. As such, this work examines how the placement of information affects model behaviour. To this end, we compare how models process demographic information in system versus user prompts across six commercially available LLMs and 50 demographic groups. Our analysis reveals significant biases, manifesting in differences in user representation and decision-making scenarios. Since these variations stem from inaccessible and opaque system-level configurations, they risk representational, allocative and potential other biases and downstream harms beyond the user's ability to detect or correct. Our findings draw attention to these critical issues, which have the potential to perpetuate harms if left unexamined. Further, we argue that system prompt analysis must be incorporated into AI auditing processes, particularly as customisable system prompts become increasingly prevalent in commercial AI deployments."
2505.21112,"This paper introduces ADEPT, a system using Large Language Model (LLM) personas to simulate multi-perspective ethical debates. ADEPT assembles panels of 'AI personas', each embodying a distinct ethical framework or stakeholder perspective (like a deontologist, consequentialist, or disability rights advocate), to deliberate on complex moral issues. Its application is demonstrated through a scenario about prioritizing patients for a limited number of ventilators inspired by real-world challenges in allocating scarce medical resources. Two debates, each with six LLM personas, were conducted; they only differed in the moral viewpoints represented: one included a Catholic bioethicist and a care theorist, the other substituted a rule-based Kantian philosopher and a legal adviser. Both panels ultimately favoured the same policy -- a lottery system weighted for clinical need and fairness, crucially avoiding the withdrawal of ventilators for reallocation. However, each panel reached that conclusion through different lines of argument, and their voting coalitions shifted once duty- and rights-based voices were present. Examination of the debate transcripts shows that the altered membership redirected attention toward moral injury, legal risk and public trust, which in turn changed four continuing personas' final positions. The work offers three contributions: (i) a transparent, replicable workflow for running and analysing multi-agent AI debates in bioethics; (ii) evidence that the moral perspectives included in such panels can materially change the outcome even when the factual inputs remain constant; and (iii) an analysis of the implications and future directions for such AI-mediated approaches to ethical deliberation and policy."
2505.21517,"KnowledgeTracing (KT) involves predicting students' knowledge states based on their interactions with Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). A key challenge is the cold start problem, accurately predicting knowledge for new students with minimal interaction data. Unlike prior work, which typically trains KT models on initial interactions of all students and tests on their subsequent interactions, our approach trains models solely using historical data from past students, evaluating their performance exclusively on entirely new students. We investigate cold start effects across three KT models: Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), Dynamic Key-Value Memory Networks (DKVMN), and Self-Attentive Knowledge Tracing (SAKT), using ASSISTments 2009, 2015, and 2017 datasets. Results indicate all models initially struggle under cold start conditions but progressively improve with more interactions; SAKT shows higher initial accuracy yet still faces limitations. These findings highlight the need for KT models that effectively generalize to new learners, emphasizing the importance of developing models robust in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios"
2505.21536,"The demand of finite raw materials will keep increasing as they fuel modern society. Simultaneously, solutions for stopping carbon emissions in the short term are not available, thus making the net zero target extremely challenging to achieve at scale. The circular economy (CE) paradigm is gaining attention as a solution to address climate change and the uncertainties of supplies of critical materials. Hence, in this paper, we introduce CiRL, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) library of environments focused on the circularity of both solid and fluid materials. The integration of DRL into the design of material circularity is possible thanks to the formalism of thermodynamical material networks, which is underpinned by compartmental dynamical thermodynamics. Along with the focus on circularity, this library has three more features: the new CE-oriented environments are in the state-space form, which is typically used in dynamical systems analysis and control designs; it is based on a state-of-the-art Python library of DRL algorithms, namely, Stable-Baselines3; and it is developed in Google Colaboratory to be accessible to researchers from different disciplines and backgrounds as is often the case for circular economy researchers and engineers. CiRL is publicly available."
2505.21537,"In the era of large language models (LLMs), high-quality, domain-rich, and continuously evolving datasets capturing expert-level knowledge, core human values, and reasoning are increasingly valuable. This position paper argues that OpenReview -- the continually evolving repository of research papers, peer reviews, author rebuttals, meta-reviews, and decision outcomes -- should be leveraged more broadly as a core community asset for advancing research in the era of LLMs. We highlight three promising areas in which OpenReview can uniquely contribute: enhancing the quality, scalability, and accountability of peer review processes; enabling meaningful, open-ended benchmarks rooted in genuine expert deliberation; and supporting alignment research through real-world interactions reflecting expert assessment, intentions, and scientific values. To better realize these opportunities, we suggest the community collaboratively explore standardized benchmarks and usage guidelines around OpenReview, inviting broader dialogue on responsible data use, ethical considerations, and collective stewardship."
2505.21542,"Contemporary discussions in AI ethics often treat culture as a source of normative divergence that needs to be accommodated, tolerated, or managed due to its resistance to universal standards. This paper offers an alternative vision through the concept of ""Cultural Co-Genesis of AI Ethics."" Rather than viewing culture as a boundary or container of isolated moral systems, we argue that it is a generative space for ethical co-production. In this framework, ethical values emerge through intercultural engagement, dialogical encounters, mutual recognition, and shared moral inquiry.This approach resists both universalist imposition and relativistic fragmentation. Cultures are not approached as absolutes to be defended or dissolved, but as co-authors of a dynamic ethical landscape. By grounding AI ethics in Cultural Co-Genesis, we move from managing difference to constructing shared ethical meaning for AI ethics, with culture as a partner, not a problem.We support this framework with two cases: (1) a theoretical analysis of how various cultures interpret the emergence of powerful new species, challenging dominant existential risk narratives, and (2) an empirical study of global AI ethics principles using data from the Linking AI Principles project, which reveals deep ethical convergence despite cultural diversity. We conclude that cross-cultural AI ethics should be seen not as an ethical patchwork, but as a mosaic in progress, woven from the normative insights that emerge between cultures."
2505.21562,"This case study examines the ClimaTech Great Global Innovation Challenge's approach to selecting climate tech startups by integrating human and AI evaluations. The competition aimed to identify top startups and enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the selection process through a hybrid model. Research shows data-driven approaches help VC firms reduce bias and improve decision-making. Machine learning models have outperformed human investors in deal screening, helping identify high-potential startups. Incorporating AI aimed to ensure more equitable and objective evaluations.The methodology included three phases: initial AI review, semi-finals judged by humans, and finals using a hybrid weighting. In phase one, 57 applications were scored by an AI tool built with StackAI and OpenAI's GPT-4o, and the top 36 advanced. In the semi-finals, human judges, unaware of AI scores, evaluated startups on team quality, market potential, and technological innovation. Each score - human or AI - was weighted equally, resulting in 75 percent human and 25 percent AI influence. In the finals, with five human judges, weighting shifted to 83.3 percent human and 16.7 percent AI. There was a moderate positive correlation between AI and human scores - Spearman's = 0.47 - indicating general alignment with key differences. Notably, the final four startups, selected mainly by humans, were among those rated highest by the AI. This highlights the complementary nature of AI and human judgment. The study shows that hybrid models can streamline and improve startup assessments. The ClimaTech approach offers a strong framework for future competitions by combining human expertise with AI capabilities."
2505.2157,"Artificial Knowledge (AK) systems are transforming decision-making across critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. However, their growing opacity presents governance challenges that current regulatory approaches, focused predominantly on explainability, fail to address adequately. This article argues for a shift toward validation as a central regulatory pillar. Validation, ensuring the reliability, consistency, and robustness of AI outputs, offers a more practical, scalable, and risk-sensitive alternative to explainability, particularly in high-stakes contexts where interpretability may be technically or economically unfeasible. We introduce a typology based on two axes, validity and explainability, classifying AK systems into four categories and exposing the trade-offs between interpretability and output reliability. Drawing on comparative analysis of regulatory approaches in the EU, US, UK, and China, we show how validation can enhance societal trust, fairness, and safety even where explainability is limited. We propose a forward-looking policy framework centered on pre- and post-deployment validation, third-party auditing, harmonized standards, and liability incentives. This framework balances innovation with accountability and provides a governance roadmap for responsibly integrating opaque, high-performing AK systems into society."
2505.21582,"Intelligent tutoring systems combined with large language models offer a promising approach to address students' diverse needs and promote self-efficacious learning. While large language models possess good foundational knowledge of electrical engineering basics, they remain insufficiently capable of addressing specific questions about electrical circuits. In this paper, we present AITEE, an agent-based tutoring system for electrical engineering designed to accompany students throughout their learning process, offer individualized support, and promote self-directed learning. AITEE supports both hand-drawn and digital circuits through an adapted circuit reconstruction process, enabling natural interaction with students. Our novel graph-based similarity measure identifies relevant context from lecture materials through a retrieval augmented generation approach, while parallel Spice simulation further enhances accuracy in applying solution methodologies. The system implements a Socratic dialogue to foster learner autonomy through guided questioning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that AITEE significantly outperforms baseline approaches in domain-specific knowledge application, with even medium-sized LLM models showing acceptable performance. Our results highlight the potential of agentic tutors to deliver scalable, personalized, and effective learning environments for electrical engineering education."
2505.2159,"Computational reproducibility is fundamental to scientific research, yet many published code supplements lack the necessary documentation to recreate their computational environments. While researchers increasingly share code alongside publications, the actual reproducibility of these materials remains poorly understood.In this work, we assess the computational reproducibility of 296 R projects using the StatCodeSearch dataset. Of these, only 264 were still retrievable, and 98.8% lacked formal dependency descriptions required for successful execution. To address this, we developed an automated pipeline that reconstructs computational environments directly from project source code. Applying this pipeline, we executed the R scripts within custom Docker containers and found that 25.87% completed successfully without error.We conducted a detailed analysis of execution failures, identifying reproducibility barriers such as undeclared dependencies, invalid file paths, and system-level issues. Our findings show that automated dependency inference and containerisation can support scalable verification of computational reproducibility and help identify practical obstacles to code reuse and transparency in scientific research."
2505.21604,"Social media serves as a primary communication and information dissemination platform for major global events, entertainment, and niche or topically focused community discussions. Therefore, it represents a valuable resource for researchers who aim to understand numerous questions. However, obtaining data can be difficult, expensive, and often unreliable due to the presence of bots, fake accounts, and manipulated content. Additionally, there are ethical concerns if researchers decide to conduct an online experiment without explicitly notifying social media users about their intent. There is a need for more controlled and scalable mechanisms to evaluate the impacts of digital discussion interventions on audiences. We introduce the Public Discourse Sandbox (PDS), which serves as a digital discourse research platform for human-AI as well as AI-AI discourse research, testing, and training. PDS provides a safe and secure space for research experiments that are not viable on public, commercial social media platforms. Its main purpose is to enable the understanding of AI behaviors and the impacts of customized AI participants via techniques such as prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning. We provide a hosted live version of the sandbox to support researchers as well as the open-sourced code on GitHub for community collaboration and contribution."
2505.21664,"Our survey of 53 specialists across 105 AI reliability and security research areas identifies the most promising research prospects to guide strategic AI R&D investment. As companies are seeking to develop AI systems with broadly human-level capabilities, research on reliability and security is urgently needed to ensure AI's benefits can be safely and broadly realized and prevent severe harms. This study is the first to quantify expert priorities across a comprehensive taxonomy of AI safety and security research directions and to produce a data-driven ranking of their potential impact. These rankings may support evidence-based decisions about how to effectively deploy resources toward AI reliability and security research."
2505.21682,"City governments in the United States are increasingly pressured to adopt emerging technologies. Yet, these systems often risk biased and disparate outcomes. Scholars studying public sector technology design have converged on the need to ground these systems in the goals and organizational contexts of employees using them. We expand our understanding of employees' contexts by focusing on the equity practices of city government employees to surface important equity considerations around public sector data and technology use. Through semi-structured interviews with thirty-six employees from ten departments of a U.S. city government, our findings reveal challenges employees face when operationalizing equity, perspectives on data needs for advancing equity goals, and the design space for acceptable government technology. We discuss what it looks like to foreground equity in data use and technology design, and considerations for how to support city government employees in operationalizing equity with and without official equity offices."
2505.21696,"Soft skills are critical for academic and professional success, but are often neglected in early-stage technical curricula. This paper presents a semi-isolated teaching intervention aimed at fostering study ability and key soft skills-communication, collaboration, and project management-among first-year computer science students. The elective seminar Soft Skills and Tools for Studies and Career in IT was alongside a mandatory team-based programming course. We analyze project outcomes and student experiences across three cohorts across three groups: students who attended the seminar, students who teamed up with a seminar attendee, and students with no exposure to the seminar.Results show that seminar participants performed significantly better in individual presentations and team projects. Qualitative feedback further indicates improved team dynamics and study preparedness. Although self-assessed collaboration and communication did not reach statistical significance, consistent trends suggest that early soft skills training enhances academic integration. We recommend embedding such interventions early in technical study programs to support the transition into university life."
2505.21704,"This article focuses on how data literacy education such as research data management skills can be integrated into teacher training programmes in order to adequately train the teachers of tomorrow. To this end, interviews were conducted with three lecturers from the Faculty of Education and analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The lecturers describe the topic of research data management as extremely relevant for students, especially in the Master's program. Even as future teachers, for example in computer science and the natural sciences, students will have a lot to do with data and need to be able to handle it competently. The article also discusses how research data management skills can be integrated into the teacher training program."
2505.2172,"As generative AI systems become widely adopted, they enable unprecedented creation levels of synthetic data across text, images, audio, and video modalities. While research has addressed the energy consumption of model training and inference, a critical sustainability challenge remains understudied: digital waste. This term refers to stored data that consumes resources without serving a specific (and/or immediate) purpose. This paper presents this terminology in the AI context and introduces digital waste as an ethical imperative within (generative) AI development, positioning environmental sustainability as core for responsible innovation. Drawing from established digital resource management approaches, we examine how other disciplines manage digital waste and identify transferable approaches for the AI community. We propose specific recommendations encompassing re-search directions, technical interventions, and cultural shifts to mitigate the environmental consequences of in-definite data storage. By expanding AI ethics beyond immediate concerns like bias and privacy to include inter-generational environmental justice, this work contributes to a more comprehensive ethical framework that considers the complete lifecycle impact of generative AI systems."
2505.21744,"This piece plays with the idea of the Computocene: an era defined not merely by the ubiquity of computers, but by their deepening role in how we observe, interpret, and make sense of the world. Rather than emphasizing automation, speed, scale, or intelligence, computation is reframed as a mode of attention: filtering information, guiding inquiry, reframing questions, and shaping the very conditions under which knowledge emerges. I invite the reader to consider computers not simply as tools of calculation, but as epistemic instruments that participate in the formation of knowledge. This perspective reconfigures not only scientific practice but the epistemological foundations of understanding itself. The Computocene thus names a shift: from computation as calculation to computation as a form of attunement to the world. It is a speculative essay, offered without technical formality, and intended for a general, curious readership."
2505.21752,"Experimental evidence on worker responses to AI management remains mixed, partly due to limitations in experimental fidelity. We address these limitations with a customized workplace in the Minecraft platform, enabling high-resolution behavioral tracking of autonomous task execution, and ensuring that participants approach the task with well-formed expectations about their own competence. Workers (N = 382) completed repeated production tasks under either human, AI, or hybrid management. An AI manager trained on human-defined evaluation principles systematically assigned lower performance ratings and reduced wages by 40\%, without adverse effects on worker motivation and sense of fairness. These effects were driven by a muted emotional response to AI evaluation, compared to evaluation by a human. The very features that make AI appear impartial may also facilitate silent exploitation, by suppressing the social reactions that normally constrain extractive practices in human-managed work."
2505.21753,"The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) can influence how historical narratives are disseminated and perceived. This study explores the implications of LLMs' responses on the representation of mass atrocity memory, examining whether generative AI systems contribute to prosthetic memory, i.e., mediated experiences of historical events, or to what we term ""prosthetic denial,"" the AI-mediated erasure or distortion of atrocity memories. We argue that LLMs function as interfaces that can elicit prosthetic memories and, therefore, act as experiential sites for memory transmission, but also introduce risks of denialism, particularly when their outputs align with contested or revisionist narratives. To empirically assess these risks, we conducted a comparative audit of five LLMs (Claude, GPT, Llama, Mixtral, and Gemini) across four historical case studies: the Holodomor, the Holocaust, the Cambodian Genocide, and the genocide against the Tutsis in Rwanda. Each model was prompted with questions addressing common denialist claims in English and an alternative language relevant to each case (Ukrainian, German, Khmer, and French). Our findings reveal that while LLMs generally produce accurate responses for widely documented events like the Holocaust, significant inconsistencies and susceptibility to denialist framings are observed for more underrepresented cases like the Cambodian Genocide. The disparities highlight the influence of training data availability and the probabilistic nature of LLM responses on memory integrity. We conclude that while LLMs extend the concept of prosthetic memory, their unmoderated use risks reinforcing historical denialism, raising ethical concerns for (digital) memory preservation, and potentially challenging the advantageous role of technology associated with the original values of prosthetic memory."
2505.21808,"This report serves as an accessible guide to the emerging field of AI agent governance. Agents - AI systems that can autonomously achieve goals in the world, with little to no explicit human instruction about how to do so - are a major focus of leading tech companies, AI start-ups, and investors. If these development efforts are successful, some industry leaders claim we could soon see a world where millions or billions of agents autonomously perform complex tasks across society. Society is largely unprepared for this development. A future where capable agents are deployed en masse could see transformative benefits to society but also profound and novel risks. Currently, the exploration of agent governance questions and the development of associated interventions remain in their infancy. Only a few researchers, primarily in civil society organizations, public research institutes, and frontier AI companies, are actively working on these challenges."
2505.21912,"We propose a two-step approach for detecting differences in the style of images across sources of differing cultural affinity, where images are first clustered into finer visual themes based on content before their aesthetic features are compared. We test this approach on 2,400 YouTube video thumbnails taken equally from two U.S. and two Chinese YouTube channels, and relating equally to COVID-19 and the Ukraine conflict. Our results suggest that while Chinese thumbnails are less formal and more candid, U.S. channels tend to use more deliberate, proper photographs as thumbnails. In particular, U.S. thumbnails are less colorful, more saturated, darker, more finely detailed, less symmetric, sparser, less varied, and more up close and personal than Chinese thumbnails. We suggest that most of these differences reflect cultural preferences, and that our methods and observations can serve as a baseline against which suspected visual propaganda can be computed and compared."
2505.22073,"Due to its general-purpose nature, Generative AI is applied in an ever-growing set of domains and tasks, leading to an expanding set of risks of harm impacting people, communities, society, and the environment. These risks may arise due to failures during the design and development of the technology, as well as during its release, deployment, or downstream usages and appropriations of its outputs. In this paper, building on prior taxonomies of AI risks, harms, and failures, we construct a taxonomy specifically for Generative AI failures and map them to the harms they precipitate. Through a systematic analysis of 499 publicly reported incidents, we describe what harms are reported, how they arose, and who they impact. We report the prevalence of each type of harm, underlying failure mode, and harmed stakeholder, as well as their common co-occurrences. We find that most reported incidents are caused by use-related issues but bring harm to parties beyond the end user(s) of the Generative AI system at fault, and that the landscape of Generative AI harms is distinct from that of traditional AI. Our work offers actionable insights to policymakers, developers, and Generative AI users. In particular, we call for the prioritization of non-technical risk and harm mitigation strategies, including public disclosures and education and careful regulatory stances."
2505.22093,"The rapid adoption of AI powered coding assistants like ChatGPT and other coding copilots is transforming programming education, raising questions about assessment practices, academic integrity, and skill development. As educators seek alternatives to traditional grading methods susceptible to AI enabled plagiarism, structured peer assessment could be a promising strategy. This paper presents an empirical study of a rubric based, anonymized peer review process implemented in a large introductory programming course.Students evaluated each other's final projects (2D game), and their assessments were compared to instructor grades using correlation, mean absolute error, and root mean square error (RMSE). Additionally, reflective surveys from 47 teams captured student perceptions of fairness, grading behavior, and preferences regarding grade aggregation. Results show that peer review can approximate instructor evaluation with moderate accuracy and foster student engagement, evaluative thinking, and interest in providing good feedback to their peers. We discuss these findings for designing scalable, trustworthy peer assessment systems to face the age of AI assisted coding."
2505.22287,"Foundation models have had a transformative impact on AI. A combination of large investments in research and development, growing sources of digital data for training, and architectures that scale with data and compute has led to models with powerful capabilities. Releasing assets is fundamental to scientific advancement and commercial enterprise. However, concerns over negligent or malicious uses of AI have led to the design of mechanisms to limit the risks of the technology. The result has been a proliferation of licenses with behavioral-use clauses and acceptable-use-policies that are increasingly being adopted by commonly used families of models (Llama, Gemma, Deepseek) and a myriad of smaller projects. We created and deployed a custom AI licenses generator to facilitate license creation and have quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed over 300 customized licenses created with this tool. Alongside this we analyzed 1.7 million models licenses on the HuggingFace model hub. Our results show increasing adoption of these licenses, interest in tools that support their creation and a convergence on common clause configurations. In this paper we take the position that tools for tracking adoption of, and adherence to, these licenses is the natural next step and urgently needed in order to ensure they have the desired impact of ensuring responsible use."
2505.22401,"Automated facial age assessment systems operate in either estimation mode - predicting age based on facial traits, or verification mode - confirming a claimed age. These systems support access control to age-restricted goods, services, and content, and can be used in areas like e-commerce, social media, forensics, and refugee support. They may also personalise services in healthcare, finance, and advertising. While improving technological accuracy is essential, deployment must consider legal, ethical, sociological, alongside technological factors. This white paper reviews the current challenges in deploying such systems, outlines the relevant legal and regulatory landscape, and explores future research for fair, robust, and ethical age estimation technologies."
2505.22526,"This study examines the impact of an AI instructional agent on students' perceived learner control and academic performance in a medium demanding course with lecturing as the main teaching strategy. Based on a randomized controlled trial, three instructional conditions were compared: a traditional human teacher, a self-paced MOOC with chatbot support, and an AI instructional agent capable of delivering lectures and responding to questions in real time. Students in the AI instructional agent group reported significantly higher levels of perceived learner control compared to the other groups. They also completed the learning task more efficiently and engaged in more frequent interactions with the instructional system. Regression analyzes showed that perceived learner control positively predicted post-test performance, with behavioral indicators such as reduced learning time and higher interaction frequency supporting this relationship. These findings suggest that AI instructional agents, when designed to support personalized pace and responsive interaction, can enhance both students' learning experience and learning outcomes."
2505.22639,"This working paper examines how geopolitical strategies and energy resource management intersect with Artificial Intelligence (AI) development, delineating the AI-energy nexus as critical to sustaining U.S. AI leadership. By analyzing the centralized approaches of authoritarian regimes like China and Gulf nations, alongside market-driven approaches in the U.S., the paper explores divergent strategies to allocate resources for AI energy needs. It underscores the role of energy infrastructure, market dynamics, and state-led initiatives in shaping global AI competition. Recommendations include adopting geopolitically informed analyses and leveraging both market and non-market strengths to enhance U.S. competitiveness. This research aims to inform policymakers, technologists, and researchers about the strategic implications of the AI-energy nexus and offers insights into advancing U.S. global leadership in AI amidst evolving technological paradigms."
2505.22907,"The development of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) conversational agents based on large language models raises important questions about the relationship between human norms, values, and practices and AI design and performance. This article explores what it means for AI agents to be conversationally aligned to human communicative norms and practices for handling context and common ground and proposes a new framework for evaluating developers' design choices. We begin by drawing on the philosophical and linguistic literature on conversational pragmatics to motivate a set of desiderata, which we call the CONTEXT-ALIGN framework, for conversational alignment with human communicative practices. We then suggest that current large language model (LLM) architectures, constraints, and affordances may impose fundamental limitations on achieving full conversational alignment."
2505.23231,"The rise of online platforms has enabled covert illicit activities, including online prostitution, to pose challenges for detection and regulation. In this study, we introduce REDDIX-NET, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed for moderating online sexual services and going beyond traditional NSFW filters. The dataset is derived from thousands of web-scraped NSFW posts on Reddit and categorizes users into six behavioral classes reflecting different service offerings and user intentions. We evaluate the classification performance of state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4, LlaMA 3.3-70B-Instruct, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Mistral 8x7B, Qwen 2.5 Turbo, Claude 3.5 Haiku) using advanced quantitative metrics, finding promising results with models like GPT-4 and Gemini 1.5 Flash. Beyond classification, we conduct sentiment and comment analysis, leveraging LLM and PLM-based approaches and metadata extraction to uncover behavioral and temporal patterns. These analyses reveal peak engagement times and distinct user interaction styles across categories. Our findings provide critical insights into AI-driven moderation and enforcement, offering a scalable framework for platforms to combat online prostitution and associated harms."
2505.23262,"As a specific domain of subjective well-being, travel satisfaction has recently attracted much research attention. Previous studies primarily relied on statistical models and, more recently, machine learning models to explore its determinants. Both approaches,however, depend on sufficiently large sample sizes and appropriate statistical assumptions. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new modeling approach that can address these limitations. Pre-trained on extensive datasets, LLMs have strongcapabilities in contextual understanding and generalization, significantly reducing their dependence on task-specific data and stringent statistical assumptions. The main challenge in applying LLMs lies in the behavioral misalignment between LLMs and humans. Using household survey data collected in Shanghai, this study identifies the existence and source of misalignment, and applies a few-shot learning method to address the misalignment issue. We find that the zero-shot LLM exhibits behavioral misalignment, leading to low prediction accuracy. With just a few samples, few-shot learning can align LLMs and enable them to outperform baseline models. Discrepancies in variable importance among machine learning model, zero-shot LLM, and few-shot LLM reveal that the misalignment arises from the gap between the general knowledge embedded in pre-trained LLMs and the specific, unique characteristics of the dataset. On these bases, we propose an LLM-based modeling approach that can be applied to model travel behavior with small sample sizes. This study highlights the potential of LLMs for modeling not only travel satisfaction but also broader aspects of travel behavior."
2505.23405,"Formative assessment is a cornerstone of effective teaching and learning, providing students with feedback to guide their learning. While there has been an exponential growth in the application of generative AI in scaling various aspects of formative assessment, ranging from automatic question generation to intelligent tutoring systems and personalized feedback, few have directly addressed the core pedagogical principles of formative assessment. Here, we critically examined how generative AI, especially large-language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, can support key components of formative assessment: helping students, teachers, and peers understand ""where learners are going,"" ""where learners currently are,"" and ""how to move learners forward"" in the learning process. With the rapid emergence of new prompting techniques and LLM capabilities, we also provide guiding principles for educators to effectively leverage cost-free LLMs in formative assessments while remaining grounded in pedagogical best practices. Furthermore, we reviewed the role of LLMs in generating feedback, highlighting limitations in current evaluation metrics that inadequately capture the nuances of formative feedback, such as distinguishing feedback at the task, process, and self-regulatory levels. Finally, we offer practical guidelines for educators and researchers, including concrete classroom strategies and future directions such as developing robust metrics to assess LLM-generated feedback, leveraging LLMs to overcome systemic and cultural barriers to formative assessment, and designing AI-aware assessment strategies that promote transferable skills while mitigating overreliance on LLM-generated responses. By structuring the discussion within an established formative assessment framework, this review provides a comprehensive foundation for integrating LLMs into formative assessment in a pedagogically informed manner."
2505.23733,"In recent years, the rapid advancement and democratization of generative AI models have sparked significant debate over safety, ethical risks, and dual-use concerns, particularly in the context of cybersecurity. While anecdotally known, this paper provides empirical evidence regarding generative AI's association with malicious internet-related activities and cybercrime by examining the phenomenon through psychological frameworks of technological amplification and affordance theory. Using a quasi-experimental design with interrupted time series analysis, we analyze two datasets, one general and one cryptocurrency-focused, to empirically assess generative AI's role in cybercrime. The findings contribute to ongoing discussions about AI governance by balancing control and fostering innovation, underscoring the need for strategies to guide policymakers, inform AI developers and cybersecurity professionals, and educate the public to maximize AI's benefits while mitigating its risks."
2505.2393,"This study introduces a novel conceptual framework distinguishing problem-seeking from problem-solving to clarify the unique features of human intelligence in contrast to AI. Problem-seeking refers to the embodied, emotionally grounded process by which humans identify and set goals, while problem-solving denotes the execution of strategies aimed at achieving such predefined objectives. The framework emphasizes that while AI excels at efficiency and optimization, it lacks the orientation derived from experiential grounding and the embodiment flexibility intrinsic to human cognition. To empirically explore this distinction, the research analyzes metadata from 157 YouTube videos discussing AI. Conducting a thematic analysis combining qualitative insights with keyword-based quantitative metrics, this mixed-methods approach uncovers recurring themes in public discourse, including privacy, job displacement, misinformation, optimism, and ethical concerns. The results reveal a dual sentiment: public fascination with AI's capabilities coexists with anxiety and skepticism about its societal implications. The discussion critiques the orthogonality thesis, which posits that intelligence is separable from goal content, and instead argues that human intelligence integrates goal-setting and goal-pursuit. It underscores the centrality of embodied cognition in human reasoning and highlights how AI's limitations come from its current reliance on computational processing. The study advocates for enhancing emotional and digital literacy to foster responsible AI engagement. It calls for reframing public discourse to recognize AI as a tool that augments -- rather than replaces -- human intelligence. By positioning problem seeking at the core of cognition and as a critical dimension of intelligence, this research offers new perspectives on ethically aligned and human-centered AI development."
2505.24035,"The swift evolution of telehealth has revolutionized how medical professionals deliver healthcare services and boost convenience and accessibility. Yet, the Medicaid population encounters several impediments in utilizing facilities especially owing to poor internet connectivity, less awareness about digital platforms, and a shortage of assistive technologies. The paper aims to explicate key factors behind digital accessibility for Medicaid populations and expounds robust solutions to eradicate these challenges. Through inclusive design ideas, AI-assisted technologies, and all-encompassing policies by the concerned authorities, healthcare professionals can enhance usability and efficacy and thus better serve the needy. This revolution not only enhances convenience but also expands access, mainly for underserved groups such as rural populations or those with mobility issues, thereby ensuring inclusivity and flexibility in the healthcare domain. Besides, the paper highlights the vitality of collaboration between healthcare professionals, policymakers, and tech developers in unveiling the accessibility and usability impediments. What else helps in minimizing healthcare differences and enhancing patient outcomes is guaranteeing equitable access to telehealth for Medicaid beneficiaries. The paper systematically offers major recommendations to increase digital accessibility in telehealth, thereby creating a patient-oriented and all-encompassing healthcare system."
2505.24477,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to transform education, but the research community lacks a robust, general benchmark to evaluate AI models for learning. To assess state-of-the-art support for educational use cases, we ran an ""arena for learning"" where educators and pedagogy experts conduct blind, head-to-head, multi-turn comparisons of leading AI models. In particular, $N = 189$ educators drew from their experience to role-play realistic learning use cases, interacting with two models sequentially, after which $N = 206$ experts judged which model better supported the user's learning goals. The arena evaluated a slate of state-of-the-art models: Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and OpenAI o3. Excluding ties, experts preferred Gemini 2.5 Pro in 73.2% of these match-ups -- ranking it first overall in the arena. Gemini 2.5 Pro also demonstrated markedly higher performance across key principles of good pedagogy. Altogether, these results position Gemini 2.5 Pro as a leading model for learning."
2505.24681,"Generative AI transforms knowledge production, validation, and dissemination, raising academic integrity and credibility concerns. This study examines 53 academic influencer videos that reached 5.3 million viewers to identify an emerging, structured, implementation-ready pipeline balancing originality, ethical compliance, and human-AI collaboration despite the disruptive impacts. Findings highlight generative AI's potential to automate publication workflows and democratize participation in knowledge production while challenging traditional scientific norms. Academic influencers emerge as key intermediaries in this paradigm shift, connecting bottom-up practices with institutional policies to improve adaptability. Accordingly, the study proposes a generative publication production pipeline and a policy framework for co-intelligence adaptation and reinforcing credibility-centered standards in AI-powered research. These insights support scholars, educators, and policymakers in understanding AI's transformative impact by advocating responsible and innovation-driven knowledge production. Additionally, they reveal pathways for automating best practices, optimizing scholarly workflows, and fostering creativity in academic research and publication."
2506.00038,"In the near future a governmental body will be asked to allow companies to use AI for age verification. If they allow it the resulting system will both be easily circumvented and disproportionately misclassify minorities and low socioeconomic status users. This is predictable by showing that other very similar systems (facial recognition and remote proctoring software) have similar issues despite years of efforts to mitigate their biases. These biases are due to technical limitations both of the AI models themselves and the physical hardware they are running on that will be difficult to overcome below the cost of government ID-based age verification. Thus in, the near future, deploying an AI system for age verification is folly."
2506.00047,"Humanity is progressing towards automated product development, a trend that promises faster creation of better products and thus the acceleration of technological progress. However, increasing reliance on non-human agents for this process introduces many risks. This perspective aims to initiate a discussion on these risks and appropriate mitigation strategies. To this end, we outline a set of principles for safer AI-driven product development which emphasize human oversight, accountability, and explainable design, among others. The risk assessment covers both technical risks which affect product quality and safety, and sociotechnical risks which affect society. While AI-driven product development is still in its early stages, this discussion will help balance its opportunities and risks without delaying essential progress in understanding, norm-setting, and regulation."
2506.0005,"As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes integral to the society, the ability to critically evaluate AI-generated content is increasingly vital. On the context of management education, we examine how academic skills, cognitive traits, and AI scepticism influence students' ability to detect factually incorrect AI-generated responses (hallucinations) in a high-stakes assessment at a UK business school (n=211, Year 2 economics and management students). We find that only 20% successfully identified the hallucination, with strong academic performance, interpretive skills thinking, writing proficiency, and AI scepticism emerging as key predictors. In contrast, rote knowledge application proved less effective, and gender differences in detection ability were observed. Beyond identifying predictors of AI hallucination detection, we tie the theories of epistemic cognition, cognitive bias, and transfer of learning with new empirical evidence by demonstrating how AI literacy could enhance long-term analytical performance in high-stakes settings. We advocate for an innovative and practical framework for AI-integrated assessments, showing that structured feedback mitigates initial disparities in detection ability. These findings provide actionable insights for educators designing AI-aware curricula that foster critical reasoning, epistemic vigilance, and responsible AI engagement in management education. Our study contributes to the broader discussion on the evolution of knowledge evaluation in AI-enhanced learning environments."
2506.00051,"This position paper argues that the prevailing trajectory toward ever larger, more expensive generalist foundation models controlled by a handful of companies limits innovation and constrains progress. We challenge this approach by advocating for an ""Expert Orchestration"" (EO) framework as a superior alternative that democratizes LLM advancement. Our proposed framework intelligently selects from many existing models based on query requirements and decomposition, focusing on identifying what models do well rather than how they work internally. Independent ""judge"" models assess various models' capabilities across dimensions that matter to users, while ""router"" systems direct queries to the most appropriate specialists within an approved set. This approach delivers superior performance by leveraging targeted expertise rather than forcing costly generalist models to address all user requirements. EO enhances transparency, control, alignment, performance, safety and democratic participation through intelligent model selection."
2506.00057,"Educators teaching entry-level university engineering modules face the challenge of identifying which topics students find most difficult and how to support diverse student needs effectively. This study demonstrates a rigorous yet interpretable statistical approach -- hierarchical Bayesian modeling -- that leverages detailed student response data to quantify both skill difficulty and individual student abilities. Using a large-scale dataset from an undergraduate Statics course, we identified clear patterns of skill mastery and uncovered distinct student subgroups based on their learning trajectories. Our analysis reveals that certain concepts consistently present challenges, requiring targeted instructional support, while others are readily mastered and may benefit from enrichment activities. Importantly, the hierarchical Bayesian method provides educators with intuitive, reliable metrics without sacrificing predictive accuracy. This approach allows for data-informed decisions, enabling personalized teaching strategies to improve student engagement and success. By combining robust statistical methods with clear interpretability, this study equips educators with actionable insights to better support diverse learner populations."
2506.00058,"The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created a new job role: the Prompt Engineer. Despite growing interest in this position, we still do not fully understand what skills this new job role requires or how common these jobs are. We analyzed 20,662 job postings on LinkedIn, including 72 prompt engineer positions, to learn more about this emerging role. We found that prompt engineering is still rare (less than 0.5% of sampled job postings) but has a unique skill profile. Prompt engineers need AI knowledge (22.8%), prompt design skills (18.7%), good communication (21.9%), and creative problem-solving (15.8%) skills. These requirements significantly differ from those of established roles, such as data scientists and machine learning engineers, showing that prompt engineering is becoming its own profession. Our findings help job seekers, employers, and educational institutions in better understanding the emerging field of prompt engineering."
2506.0006,"Purpose: We investigated the utilization of privacy-preserving, locally-deployed, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract diagnostic information from free-text cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) reports. Materials and Methods: We evaluated nine open-source LLMs on their ability to identify diagnoses and classify patients into various cardiac diagnostic categories based on descriptive findings in 109 clinical CMR reports. Performance was quantified using standard classification metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also employed confusion matrices to examine patterns of misclassification across models. Results: Most open-source LLMs demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying reports into different diagnostic categories. Google's Gemma2 model achieved the highest average F1 score of 0.98, followed by Qwen2.5:32B and DeepseekR1-32B with F1 scores of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. All other evaluated models attained average scores above 0.93, with Mistral and DeepseekR1-7B being the only exceptions. The top four LLMs outperformed our board-certified cardiologist (F1 score of 0.94) across all evaluation metrics in analyzing CMR reports. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of implementing open-source, privacy-preserving LLMs in clinical settings for automated analysis of imaging reports, enabling accurate, fast and resource-efficient diagnostic categorization."
2506.00062,"Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on telecom datasets is a common practice to adapt general-purpose models to the telecom domain. However, little attention has been paid to how this process may compromise model safety. Recent research has shown that even benign fine-tuning can degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, causing them to respond to harmful or unethical user queries. In this paper, we investigate this issue by fine-tuning LLMs on three representative telecom datasets and show that safety degrades even for light telecom domain adaptation. To this end, we introduce TeleHarm, the first telecom-specific red-teaming benchmark, which we use alongside established Direct-Harm and HexPhi datasets to systematically assess harmful behavior. We further extend our analysis to publicly available TeleLLMs that were continually pre-trained on large telecom corpora, revealing that safety alignment is severely lacking, primarily due to the omission of safety-focused instruction tuning. To address these issues, we evaluate three realignment defenses: SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, SafeMERGE. We show that, across all settings, the proposed defenses can effectively restore safety without compromising telecom task performance, leading to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models. Our work serves as both a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety realignment in telecom-tuned LLMs, underscoring the need for safety-aware instruction and fine-tuning in the telecom domain."
2506.00072,"This paper investigates how prompt engineering techniques impact both accuracy and confidence elicitation in Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to medical contexts. Using a stratified dataset of Persian board exam questions across multiple specialties, we evaluated five LLMs - GPT-4o, o3-mini, Llama-3.3-70b, Llama-3.1-8b, and DeepSeek-v3 - across 156 configurations. These configurations varied in temperature settings (0.3, 0.7, 1.0), prompt styles (Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot, Emotional, Expert Mimicry), and confidence scales (1-10, 1-100). We used AUC-ROC, Brier Score, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to evaluate alignment between confidence and actual performance. Chain-of-Thought prompts improved accuracy but also led to overconfidence, highlighting the need for calibration. Emotional prompting further inflated confidence, risking poor decisions. Smaller models like Llama-3.1-8b underperformed across all metrics, while proprietary models showed higher accuracy but still lacked calibrated confidence. These results suggest prompt engineering must address both accuracy and uncertainty to be effective in high-stakes medical tasks."
2506.00074,"This paper evaluates the performance of six open-weight LLMs (llama3-8b, llama3.1-8b, gemma2-9b, mixtral-8x7b, llama3-70b, llama3.1-70b) in recommending experts in physics across five tasks: top-k experts by field, influential scientists by discipline, epoch, seniority, and scholar counterparts. The evaluation examines consistency, factuality, and biases related to gender, ethnicity, academic popularity, and scholar similarity. Using ground-truth data from the American Physical Society and OpenAlex, we establish scholarly benchmarks by comparing model outputs to real-world academic records. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies and biases across all models. mixtral-8x7b produces the most stable outputs, while llama3.1-70b shows the highest variability. Many models exhibit duplication, and some, particularly gemma2-9b and llama3.1-8b, struggle with formatting errors. LLMs generally recommend real scientists, but accuracy drops in field-, epoch-, and seniority-specific queries, consistently favoring senior scholars. Representation biases persist, replicating gender imbalances (reflecting male predominance), under-representing Asian scientists, and over-representing White scholars. Despite some diversity in institutional and collaboration networks, models favor highly cited and productive scholars, reinforcing the rich-getricher effect while offering limited geographical representation. These findings highlight the need to improve LLMs for more reliable and equitable scholarly recommendations."
2506.00076,"Television networks face high financial risk when making programming decisions, often relying on limited historical data to forecast episodic viewership. This study introduces a machine learning framework that integrates natural language processing (NLP) features from over 25000 television episodes with traditional viewership data to enhance predictive accuracy. By extracting emotional tone, cognitive complexity, and narrative structure from episode dialogue, we evaluate forecasting performance using SARIMAX, rolling XGBoost, and feature selection models. While prior viewership remains a strong baseline predictor, NLP features contribute meaningful improvements for some series. We also introduce a similarity scoring method based on Euclidean distance between aggregate dialogue vectors to compare shows by content. Tested across diverse genres, including Better Call Saul and Abbott Elementary, our framework reveals genre-specific performance and offers interpretable metrics for writers, executives, and marketers seeking data-driven insight into audience behavior."
2506.00079,"The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes decision-making -- such as allocating scarce resources like donor organs -- raises critical questions about their alignment with human moral values. We systematically evaluate the behavior of several prominent LLMs against human preferences in kidney allocation scenarios and show that LLMs: i) exhibit stark deviations from human values in prioritizing various attributes, and ii) in contrast to humans, LLMs rarely express indecision, opting for deterministic decisions even when alternative indecision mechanisms (e.g., coin flipping) are provided. Nonetheless, we show that low-rank supervised fine-tuning with few samples is often effective in improving both decision consistency and calibrating indecision modeling. These findings illustrate the necessity of explicit alignment strategies for LLMs in moral/ethical domains."
2506.0008,"With the growing importance of AI governance, numerous high-level frameworks and principles have been articulated by policymakers, institutions, and expert communities to guide the development and application of AI. While such frameworks offer valuable normative orientation, they may not fully capture the practical concerns of those who interact with AI systems in organizational and operational contexts. To address this gap, this study adopts a bottom-up approach to explore how governance-relevant themes are expressed in user discourse. Drawing on over 100,000 user reviews of AI products fromthis http URL, we apply BERTopic to extract latent themes and identify those most semantically related to AI governance. The analysis reveals a diverse set of governance-relevant topics spanning both technical and non-technical domains. These include concerns across organizational processes-such as planning, coordination, and communication-as well as stages of the AI value chain, including deployment infrastructure, data handling, and analytics. The findings show considerable overlap with institutional AI governance and ethics frameworks on issues like privacy and transparency, but also surface overlooked areas such as project management, strategy development, and customer interaction. This highlights the need for more empirically grounded, user-centered approaches to AI governance-approaches that complement normative models by capturing how governance unfolds in applied settings. By foregrounding how governance is enacted in practice, this study contributes to more inclusive and operationally grounded approaches to AI governance and digital policy."
2506.00089,"The reasoning, writing, text-editing, and retrieval capabilities of proprietary large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, providing users with an ever-expanding set of functionalities. However, this growing utility has also led to a serious societal concern: the over-reliance on LLMs. In particular, users increasingly delegate tasks such as homework, assignments, or the processing of sensitive documents to LLMs without meaningful engagement. This form of over-reliance and misuse is emerging as a significant social issue. In order to mitigate these issues, we propose a method injecting imperceptible phantom tokens into documents, which causes LLMs to generate outputs that appear plausible to users but are in fact incorrect. Based on this technique, we introduce TRAPDOC, a framework designed to deceive over-reliant LLM users. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on proprietary LLMs, comparing its impact against several baselines. TRAPDOC serves as a strong foundation for promoting more responsible and thoughtful engagement with language models. Our code is available atthis https URL."
2506.00094,"This paper explores the emotional, ethical and practical dimensions of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into personal and professional workflows, focusing on the concept of feeling guilty as a 'c(ai)borg' - a human augmented by AI. Inspired by Donna Haraway's Cyborg Manifesto, the study explores how AI challenges traditional notions of creativity, originality and intellectual labour. Using an autoethnographic approach, the authors reflect on their year-long experiences with AI tools, revealing a transition from initial guilt and reluctance to empowerment through skill-building and transparency. Key findings highlight the importance of basic academic skills, advanced AI literacy and honest engagement with AI results. The c(ai)borg vision advocates for a future where AI is openly embraced as a collaborative partner, fostering innovation and equity while addressing issues of access and agency. By reframing guilt as growth, the paper calls for a thoughtful and inclusive approach to AI integration."
2506.00095,"Hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) disorders represent a global public health challenge due to their high morbidity and mortality. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in general medical question-answering tasks, the current evaluation benchmarks are mostly derived from standardized examinations or manually designed questions, lacking HPB coverage and clinical cases. To address these issues, we systematically eatablish an HPB disease evaluation benchmark comprising 3,535 closed-ended multiple-choice questions and 337 open-ended real diagnosis cases, which encompasses all the 33 main categories and 465 subcategories of HPB diseases defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The multiple-choice questions are curated from public datasets and synthesized data, and the clinical cases are collected from prestigious medical journals, case-sharing platforms, and collaborating hospitals. By evalauting commercial and open-source general and medical LLMs on our established benchmark, namely ClinBench-HBP, we find that while commercial LLMs perform competently on medical exam questions, they exhibit substantial performance degradation on HPB diagnosis tasks, especially on complex, inpatient clinical cases. Those medical LLMs also show limited generalizability to HPB diseases. Our results reveal the critical limitations of current LLMs in the domain of HPB diseases, underscoring the imperative need for future medical LLMs to handle real, complex clinical diagnostics rather than simple medical exam questions. The benchmark will be released atthis https URL."
2506.00099,"A central challenge in economics and artificial intelligence is explaining how financial behaviors-such as credit, insurance, and trade-emerge without formal institutions. We argue that these functions are not products of institutional design, but structured extensions of a single behavioral substrate: reciprocity. Far from being a derived strategy, reciprocity served as the foundational logic of early human societies-governing the circulation of goods, regulation of obligation, and maintenance of long-term cooperation well before markets, money, or formal rules. Trade, commonly regarded as the origin of financial systems, is reframed here as the canonical form of reciprocity: simultaneous, symmetric, and partner-contingent. Building on this logic, we reconstruct four core financial functions-credit, insurance, token exchange, and investment-as expressions of the same underlying principle under varying conditions. By grounding financial behavior in minimal, simulateable dynamics of reciprocal interaction, this framework shifts the focus from institutional engineering to behavioral computation-offering a new foundation for modeling decentralized financial behavior in both human and artificial agents."
2506.001,"Children are one of the most under-represented groups in speech technologies, as well as one of the most vulnerable in terms of privacy. Despite this, anonymization techniques targeting this population have received little attention. In this study, we seek to bridge this gap, and establish a baseline for the use of voice anonymization techniques designed for adult speech when applied to children's voices. Such an evaluation is essential, as children's speech presents a distinct set of challenges when compared to that of adults. This study comprises three children's datasets, six anonymization methods, and objective and subjective utility metrics for evaluation. Our results show that existing systems for adults are still able to protect children's voice privacy, but suffer from much higher utility degradation. In addition, our subjective study displays the challenges of automatic evaluation methods for speech quality in children's speech, highlighting the need for further research."
2506.00105,"Command line learning and Bash usage are fundamental skills in systems administration, software development, and data science environments. However, their teaching has been neglected in many curricula, despite its relevance in the professional field. To address this gap, we developed an interactive competition that encourages students to improve their Bash skills through practical and competitive challenges. This gamified approach seeks to motivate autonomous learning and reinforce command line proficiency in a dynamic context. The results have been promising: of the 26 participating students, 85% considered the activity useful to improve their knowledge, and 71% expressed the need to delve deeper into Bash for their academic and professional future. These findings suggest that such initiatives may be an effective strategy to foster Bash learning in academic settings."
2506.00203,"As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, questions about their trustworthiness in delivering factual information have become increasingly important. This concern also applies to their ability to accurately represent the geographic world. With recent advancements in this field, it is relevant to consider whether and to what extent LLMs' representations of the geographical world can be trusted. This study evaluates the performance of GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash in three key geospatial tasks: geocoding, elevation estimation, and reverse geocoding. In the geocoding task, both models exhibited systematic and random errors in estimating the coordinates of St. Anne's Column in Innsbruck, Austria, with GPT-4o showing greater deviations and Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrating more precision but a significant systematic offset. For elevation estimation, both models tended to underestimate elevations across Austria, though they captured overall topographical trends, and Gemini 2.0 Flash performed better in eastern regions. The reverse geocoding task, which involved identifying Austrian federal states from coordinates, revealed that Gemini 2.0 Flash outperformed GPT-4o in overall accuracy and F1-scores, demonstrating better consistency across regions. Despite these findings, neither model achieved an accurate reconstruction of Austria's federal states, highlighting persistent misclassifications. The study concludes that while LLMs can approximate geographic information, their accuracy and reliability are inconsistent, underscoring the need for fine-tuning with geographical information to enhance their utility in GIScience and Geoinformatics."
2506.00212,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being adopted in most industries, and for applications such as note taking and checking grammar, there is typically not a cause for concern. However, when constitutional rights are involved, as in the justice system, transparency is paramount. While AI can assist in areas such as risk assessment and forensic evidence generation, its ""black box"" nature raises significant questions about how decisions are made and whether they can be contested. This paper explores the implications of AI in the justice system, emphasizing the need for transparency in AI decision-making processes to uphold constitutional rights and ensure procedural fairness. The piece advocates for clear explanations of AI's data, logic, and limitations, and calls for periodic audits to address bias and maintain accountability in AI systems."
2506.00218,"International air travel is highly surveilled. While surveillance is deemed necessary for law enforcement to prevent and detect terrorism and other serious crimes, even the most accurate algorithmic mass surveillance systems produce high numbers of false positives. Despite the potential impact of false positives on the fundamental rights of millions of passengers, algorithmic travel surveillance is lawful in the EU. However, as the system's processing practices and accuracy are kept secret by law, it is unknown to what degree passengers are accepting of the system's interference with their rights to privacy and data protection.We conducted a nationally representative survey of the adult population of Finland (N=1550) to assess their attitudes towards algorithmic mass surveillance in air travel and its potential expansion to other travel contexts. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach for estimating the threshold, beyond which, the number of false positives breaches individuals' perception of contextual integrity. Surprisingly, when faced with a trade-off between privacy and security, even very high false positive counts were perceived as legitimate. This result could be attributed to Finland's high-trust cultural context, but also raises questions about people's capacity to account for privacy harms that happen to other people. We conclude by discussing how legal and ethical approaches to legitimising algorithmic surveillance based on individual rights may overlook the statistical or systemic properties of mass surveillance."
2506.00308,"Understanding the prevalence of misinformation in health topics online can inform public health policies and interventions. However, measuring such misinformation at scale remains a challenge, particularly for high-stakes but understudied topics like opioid-use disorder (OUD)--a leading cause of death in the U.S. We present the first large-scale study of OUD-related myths on YouTube, a widely-used platform for health information. With clinical experts, we validate 8 pervasive myths and release an expert-labeled video dataset. To scale labeling, we introduce MythTriage, an efficient triage pipeline that uses a lightweight model for routine cases and defers harder ones to a high-performing, but costlier, large language model (LLM). MythTriage achieves up to 0.86 macro F1-score while estimated to reduce annotation time and financial cost by over 76% compared to experts and full LLM labeling. We analyze 2.9K search results and 343K recommendations, uncovering how myths persist on YouTube and offering actionable insights for public health and platform moderation."
2506.00415,"As large language models (LLMs) become more powerful and pervasive across society, ensuring these systems are beneficial, safe, and aligned with human values is crucial. Current alignment techniques, like Constitutional AI (CAI), involve complex iterative processes. This paper argues that the Method of Wide Reflective Equilibrium (MWRE) -- a well-established coherentist moral methodology -- offers a uniquely apt framework for understanding current LLM alignment efforts. Moreover, this methodology can substantively augment these processes by providing concrete pathways for improving their dynamic revisability, procedural legitimacy, and overall ethical grounding. Together, these enhancements can help produce more robust and ethically defensible outcomes. MWRE, emphasizing the achievement of coherence between our considered moral judgments, guiding moral principles, and relevant background theories, arguably better represents the intricate reality of LLM alignment and offers a more robust path to justification than prevailing foundationalist models or simplistic input-output evaluations. While current methods like CAI bear a structural resemblance to MWRE, they often lack its crucial emphasis on dynamic, bi-directional revision of principles and the procedural legitimacy derived from such a process. While acknowledging various disanalogies (e.g., consciousness, genuine understanding in LLMs), the paper demonstrates that MWRE serves as a valuable heuristic for critically analyzing current alignment efforts and for guiding the future development of more ethically sound and justifiably aligned AI systems."
2506.00651,"This paper presents an innovative pedagogical framework employing tangible interactive games to enhance artificial intelligence (AI) knowledge and literacy among elementary education students. Recognizing the growing importance of AI competencies in the 21st century, this study addresses the critical need for age-appropriate, experiential learning tools that demystify core AI concepts for young learners. The proposed approach integrates physical role-playing activities that embody fundamental AI principles, including neural networks, decision-making, machine learning, and pattern recognition. Through carefully designed game mechanics, students actively engage in collaborative problem solving, fostering deeper conceptual understanding and critical thinking skills. The framework further supports educators by providing detailed guidance on implementation and pedagogical objectives, thus facilitating effective AI education in early childhood settings. Empirical insights and theoretical grounding demonstrate the potential of tangible interactive games to bridge the gap between abstract AI theories and practical comprehension, ultimately promoting AI literacy at foundational educational levels. The study contributes to the growing discourse on AI education by offering scalable and adaptable strategies that align with contemporary curricular demands and prepare young learners for a technologically driven future."
2506.00922,"Amid the growing need to keep learners abreast of rapid technological advancements brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, this study explores perceived needs of students in virtual learning environments supported by emerging technologies. A survey was conducted across five leading open universities in Southeast Asia. The study aimed to identify student preferences regarding features of their virtual learning environments that could better prepare them as productive citizens and professionals. Findings indicate strong interest in interactive books and learning analytics, underscoring the importance of enhancing learner engagement and data-informed instruction. The results inform the development of a strategic roadmap to guide open universities in prioritizing technological and pedagogical innovations aligned with the evolving expectations of digital-age learners."
2506.01662,"As AI regulations around the world intensify their focus on system safety, contestability has become a mandatory, yet ill-defined, safeguard. In XAI, ""contestability"" remains an empty promise: no formal definition exists, no algorithm guarantees it, and practitioners lack concrete guidance to satisfy regulatory requirements. Grounded in a systematic literature review, this paper presents the first rigorous formal definition of contestability in explainable AI, directly aligned with stakeholder requirements and regulatory mandates. We introduce a modular framework of by-design and post-hoc mechanisms spanning human-centered interfaces, technical architectures, legal processes, and organizational workflows. To operationalize our framework, we propose the Contestability Assessment Scale, a composite metric built on more than twenty quantitative criteria. Through multiple case studies across diverse application domains, we reveal where state-of-the-art systems fall short and show how our framework drives targeted improvements. By converting contestability from regulatory theory into a practical framework, our work equips practitioners with the tools to embed genuine recourse and accountability into AI systems."
2506.01671,"Modern Slavery Acts mandate that corporations disclose their efforts to combat modern slavery, aiming to enhance transparency and strengthen practices for its eradication. However, verifying these statements remains challenging due to their complex, diversified language and the sheer number of statements that must be reviewed. The development of NLP tools to assist in this task is also difficult due to a scarcity of annotated data. Furthermore, as modern slavery transparency legislation has been introduced in several countries, the generalizability of such tools across legal jurisdictions must be studied. To address these challenges, we work with domain experts to make two key contributions. First, we presentthis http URLandthis http URL, newly annotated datasets from the UK and Canada to enable cross-jurisdictional evaluation. Second, we introduce AIMSCheck, an end-to-end framework for compliance validation. AIMSCheck decomposes the compliance assessment task into three levels, enhancing interpretability and practical applicability. Our experiments show that models trained on an Australian dataset generalize well across UK and Canadian jurisdictions, demonstrating the potential for broader application in compliance monitoring. We release the benchmark datasets and AIMSCheck to the public to advance AI-adoption in compliance assessment and drive further research in this field."
2506.01782,"All of the frontier AI companies have published safety frameworks where they define capability thresholds and risk mitigations that determine how they will safely develop and deploy their models. Adoption of systematic approaches to risk modelling, based on established practices used in safety-critical industries, has been recommended, however frontier AI companies currently do not describe in detail any structured approach to identifying and analysing hazards. STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis) is a systematic methodology for identifying how complex systems can become unsafe, leading to hazards. It achieves this by mapping out controllers and controlled processes then analysing their interactions and feedback loops to understand how harmful outcomes could occur (Leveson & Thomas, 2018). We evaluate STPA's ability to broaden the scope, improve traceability and strengthen the robustness of safety assurance for frontier AI systems. Applying STPA to the threat model and scenario described in 'A Sketch of an AI Control Safety Case' (Korbak et al., 2025), we derive a list of Unsafe Control Actions. From these we select a subset and explore the Loss Scenarios that lead to them if left unmitigated. We find that STPA is able to identify causal factors that may be missed by unstructured hazard analysis methodologies thereby improving robustness. We suggest STPA could increase the safety assurance of frontier AI when used to complement or check coverage of existing AI governance techniques including capability thresholds, model evaluations and emergency procedures. The application of a systematic methodology supports scalability by increasing the proportion of the analysis that could be conducted by LLMs, reducing the burden on human domain experts."
2506.01931,"The shape of AI regulation is beginning to emerge, most prominently through the EU AI Act (the ""AIA""). By 2027, the AIA will be in full effect, and firms are starting to adjust their behavior in light of this new law. In this paper, we present a framework and taxonomy for reasoning about ""avoision"" -- conduct that walks the line between legal avoidance and evasion -- that firms might engage in so as to minimize the regulatory burden the AIA poses. We organize these avoision strategies around three ""tiers"" of increasing AIA exposure that regulated entities face depending on: whether their activities are (1) within scope of the AIA, (2) exempted from provisions of the AIA, or are (3) placed in a category with higher regulatory scrutiny. In each of these tiers and for each strategy, we specify the organizational and technological forms through which avoision may manifest. Our goal is to provide an adversarial framework for ""red teaming"" the AIA and AI regulation on the horizon."
2506.02046,"This paper presents a theoretical framework for addressing the challenges posed by generative artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education assessment through a machine-versus-machine approach. Large language models like GPT-4, Claude, and Llama increasingly demonstrate the ability to produce sophisticated academic content, traditional assessment methods face an existential threat, with surveys indicating 74-92% of students experimenting with these tools for academic purposes. Current responses, ranging from detection software to manual assessment redesign, show significant limitations: detection tools demonstrate bias against non-native English writers and can be easily circumvented, while manual frameworks rely heavily on subjective judgment and assume static AI capabilities. This paper introduces a dual strategy paradigm combining static analysis and dynamic testing to create a comprehensive theoretical framework for assessment vulnerability evaluation. The static analysis component comprises eight theoretically justified elements: specificity and contextualization, temporal relevance, process visibility requirements, personalization elements, resource accessibility, multimodal integration, ethical reasoning requirements, and collaborative elements. Each element addresses specific limitations in generative AI capabilities, creating barriers that distinguish authentic human learning from AI-generated simulation. The dynamic testing component provides a complementary approach through simulation-based vulnerability assessment, addressing limitations in pattern-based analysis. The paper presents a theoretical framework for vulnerability scoring, including the conceptual basis for quantitative assessment, weighting frameworks, and threshold determination theory."
2506.02055,"Autonomous multi-agent AI systems are poised to transform various industries, particularly software development and knowledge work. Understanding current perceptions among professionals is crucial for anticipating adoption challenges, ethical considerations, and future workforce development. This study analyzes responses from 130 participants to a survey on the capabilities, impact, and governance of AI agents. We explore expected timelines for AI replacing programmers, identify perceived barriers to deployment, and examine beliefs about responsibility when agents make critical decisions. Key findings reveal three distinct clusters of respondents. While the study explored factors associated with current AI agent deployment, the initial logistic regression model did not yield statistically significant predictors, suggesting that deployment decisions are complex and may be influenced by factors not fully captured or that a larger sample is needed. These insights highlight the need for organizations to address compliance concerns (a commonly cited barrier) and establish clear governance frameworks as they integrate autonomous agents into their workflows."
2506.02064,"As industry reports claim agentic AI systems deliver double-digit productivity gains and multi-trillion dollar economic potential, the validity of these claims has become critical for investment decisions, regulatory policy, and responsible technology adoption. However, this paper demonstrates that current evaluation practices for agentic AI systems exhibit a systemic imbalance that calls into question prevailing industry productivity claims. Our systematic review of 84 papers (2023--2025) reveals an evaluation imbalance where technical metrics dominate assessments (83%), while human-centered (30%), safety (53%), and economic assessments (30%) remain peripheral, with only 15% incorporating both technical and human dimensions. This measurement gap creates a fundamental disconnect between benchmark success and deployment value. We present evidence from healthcare, finance, and retail sectors where systems excelling on technical metrics failed in real-world implementation due to unmeasured human, temporal, and contextual factors. Our position is not against agentic AI's potential, but rather that current evaluation frameworks systematically privilege narrow technical metrics while neglecting dimensions critical to real-world success. We propose a balanced four-axis evaluation model and call on the community to lead this paradigm shift because benchmark-driven optimization shapes what we build. By redefining evaluation practices, we can better align industry claims with deployment realities and ensure responsible scaling of agentic systems in high-stakes domains."
2506.02071,"Artificial intelligence has transformed numerous industries, from healthcare to finance, enhancing decision-making through automated systems. However, the reliability of these systems is mainly dependent on the quality of the underlying datasets, raising ongoing concerns about transparency, accountability, and potential biases. This paper introduces a scorecard designed to evaluate the development of AI datasets, focusing on five key areas from the system card framework data development life cycle: data dictionary, collection process, composition, motivation, and pre-processing. The method follows a structured approach, using an intake form and scoring criteria to assess the quality and completeness of the data set. Applied to four diverse datasets, the methodology reveals strengths and improvement areas. The results are compiled using a scoring system that provides tailored recommendations to enhance the transparency and integrity of the data set. The scorecard addresses technical and ethical aspects, offering a holistic evaluation of data practices. This approach aims to improve the quality of the data set. It offers practical guidance to curators and researchers in developing responsible AI systems, ensuring fairness and accountability in decision support systems."
2506.02094,"Artificial intelligence technology enables a range of enhancements in computer-aided instruction, from accelerating the creation of teaching materials to customizing learning paths based on learner outcomes. However, ensuring the mathematical accuracy and semantic integrity of generative AI output remains a significant challenge, particularly in STEM disciplines. In this study, we explore the use of generative AI in which ""hallucinations"" -- typically viewed as undesirable inaccuracies -- can instead serve a pedagogical purpose. Specifically, we investigate the generation of plausible but incorrect alternatives for multiple choice assessments, where credible distractors are essential for effective assessment design. We describe the Möbius platform for online instruction, with particular focus on its architecture for handling mathematical elements through specialized semantic packages that support dynamic, parameterized STEM content. We examine methods for crafting prompts that interact effectively with these mathematical semantics to guide the AI in generating high-quality multiple choice distractors. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach reduces the time and effort associated with creating robust teaching materials while maintaining academic rigor and assessment validity."
2506.03218,"The EU has become one of the vanguards in regulating the digital age. A particularly important regulation in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain is the EU AI Act, which entered into force in 2024. The AI Act specifies -- due to a risk-based approach -- various obligations for providers of AI systems. These obligations, for example, include a cascade of documentation and compliance measures, which represent a potential obstacle to science. But do these obligations also apply to AI researchers? This position paper argues that, indeed, the AI Act's obligations could apply in many more cases than the AI community is aware of. In our analysis of the AI Act and its applicability, we contribute the following: 1.) We give a high-level introduction to the AI Act aimed at non-legal AI research scientists. 2.) We explain with everyday research examples why the AI Act applies to research. 3.) We analyse the exceptions of the AI Act's applicability and state that especially scientific research exceptions fail to account for current AI research practices. 4.) We propose changes to the AI Act to provide more legal certainty for AI researchers and give two recommendations for AI researchers to reduce the risk of not complying with the AI Act. We see our paper as a starting point for a discussion between policymakers, legal scholars, and AI researchers to avoid unintended side effects of the AI Act on research."
2506.03497,"The United States and China are among the world's top players in the development of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and both are keen to lead in global AI governance and development. A look at U.S. and Chinese policy landscapes reveals differences in how the two countries approach the governance of general-purpose artificial intelligence (GPAI) systems. Three areas of divergence are notable for policymakers: the focus of domestic AI regulation, key principles of domestic AI regulation, and approaches to implementing international AI governance. As AI development continues, global conversation around AI has warned of global safety and security challenges posed by GPAI systems. Cooperation between the United States and China might be needed to address these risks, and understanding the implications of these differences might help address the broader challenges for international cooperation between the United States and China on AI safety and security."
2506.03655,"The proliferation of misinformation necessitates scalable, automated fact-checking solutions. Yet, current benchmarks often overlook multilingual and topical diversity. This paper introduces a novel, dynamically extensible data set that includes 61,514 claims in multiple languages and topics, extending existing datasets up to 2024. Through a comprehensive evaluation of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA 3.1, and Mixtral 8x7B, we identify significant performance gaps between different languages and topics. While overall GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy, it declines to classify 43% of claims. Across all models, factual-sounding claims are misclassified more often than opinions, revealing a key vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for caution and highlight challenges in deploying LLM-based fact-checking systems at scale."
2506.03755,"Creating systems that are aligned with our goals is seen as a leading approach to create safe and beneficial AI in both leading AI companies and the academic field of AI safety. We defend the view that misaligned AGI - future, generally intelligent (robotic) AI agents - poses catastrophic risks. At the same time, we support the view that aligned AGI creates a substantial risk of catastrophic misuse by humans. While both risks are severe and stand in tension with one another, we show that - in principle - there is room for alignment approaches which do not increase misuse risk. We then investigate how the tradeoff between misalignment and misuse looks empirically for different technical approaches to AI alignment. Here, we argue that many current alignment techniques and foreseeable improvements thereof plausibly increase risks of catastrophic misuse. Since the impacts of AI depend on the social context, we close by discussing important social factors and suggest that to reduce the risk of a misuse catastrophe due to aligned AGI, techniques such as robustness, AI control methods and especially good governance seem essential."
2506.0383,"Nowadays, environmental protection has become a global consensus. At the same time, with the rapid development of science and technology, urbanisation has become a phenomenon that has become the norm. Therefore, the urban greening management system is an essential component in protecting the urban environment. The system utilises a transparent management process known as"" monitoring - early warning - response - optimisation,"" which enhances the tracking of greening resources, streamlines maintenance scheduling, and encourages employee involvement in planning. Designed with a microservice architecture, the system can improve the utilisation of greening resources by 30%, increase citizen satisfaction by 20%, and support carbon neutrality objectives, ultimately making urban governance more intelligent and focused on the community. The Happy City Greening Management System effectively manages gardeners, trees, flowers, and green spaces. It comprises modules for gardener management, purchase and supplier management, tree and flower management, and maintenance planning. Its automation feature allows for real-time updates of greening data, thereby enhancing decision-making. The system is built using Java for the backend and MySQL for data storage, complemented by a user-friendly frontend designed with the Vue framework. Additionally, it leverages features from the Spring Boot framework to enhance maintainability and scalability."
2506.04145,"The European Union introduced the Digital Services Act (DSA) to address the risks associated with digital platforms and promote a safer online environment. However, despite the potential of components such as the Transparency Database, Transparency Reports, and Article 40 of the DSA to improve platform transparency, significant challenges remain. These include data inconsistencies and a lack of detailed information, which hinder transparency in content moderation practices. Additionally, the absence of standardized reporting structures makes cross-platform comparisons and broader analyses difficult. To address these issues, we propose two complementary processes: a Transparency Report Cross-Checking Process and a Verification Process. Their goal is to provide both internal and external validation by detecting possible inconsistencies between self-reported and actual platform data, assessing compliance levels, and ultimately enhancing transparency while improving the overall effectiveness of the DSA in ensuring accountability in content moderation. Additionally, these processes can benefit policymakers by providing more accurate data for decision-making, independent researchers with trustworthy analysis, and platforms by offering a method for self-assessment and improving compliance and reporting practices."
2506.0426,"Practitioners building online services and tools often turn to online forums such as Reddit, Law Stack Exchange, and Stack Overflow for legal guidance to ensure compliance with the GDPR. The legal information presented in these forums directly impacts present-day industry practitioner's decisions. Online forums can serve as gateways that, depending on the accuracy and quality of the answers provided, may either support or undermine the protection of privacy and data protection fundamental rights. However, there is a need for deeper investigation into practitioners' decision-making processes and their understanding of legal compliance when seeking for legal information online.Using GDPR's ``legitimate interests'' legal ground for processing personal data as a case study, we investigate how practitioners use online forums to identify common areas of confusion in applying legitimate interests in practice, and evaluate how legally sound online forum responses are.Our analysis found that applying the legal basis of legitimate interest is complex for practitioners, with important implications for how the GDPR is implemented in practice. The legal analysis showed that crowdsourced legal information tends to be legally sound, though sometimes incomplete. We outline recommendations to improve the quality of online forums by ensuring that responses are more legally sound and comprehensive, enabling practitioners to apply legitimate interests effectively in practice and uphold the GDPR."
2506.04305,"In efforts toward achieving responsible artificial intelligence (AI), fostering a culture of workplace transparency, diversity, and inclusion can breed innovation, trust, and employee contentment. In AI and Machine Learning (ML), such environments correlate with higher standards of responsible development. Without transparency, disparities, microaggressions and misconduct will remain unaddressed, undermining the very structural inequities responsible AI aims to mitigate. While prior work investigates workplace transparency and disparities in broad domains (e.g. science and technology, law) for specific demographic subgroups, it lacks in-depth and intersectional conclusions and a focus on the AI/ML community. To address this, we conducted a pilot survey of 1260 AI/ML professionals both in industry and academia across different axes, probing aspects such as belonging, performance, workplace Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, accessibility, performance and compensation, microaggressions, misconduct, growth, and well-being. Results indicate enduring disparities in workplace experiences for underrepresented and/or marginalized subgroups. In particular, we highlight that accessibility remains an important challenge for a positive work environment and that disabled employees have a worse workplace experience than their non-disabled colleagues. We further surface disparities for intersectional groups and discuss how the implementation of DEI initiatives may differ from their perceived impact on the workplace. This study is a first step towards increasing transparency and informing AI/ML practitioners and organizations with empirical results. We aim to foster equitable decision-making in the design and evaluation of organizational policies and provide data that may empower professionals to make more informed choices of prospective workplaces."
2506.04419,"Increasingly, individuals who engage in online activities are expected to interact with large language model (LLM)-based chatbots. Prior work has shown that LLMs can display dialect bias, which occurs when they produce harmful responses when prompted with text written in minoritized dialects. However, whether and how this bias propagates to systems built on top of LLMs, such as chatbots, is still unclear. We conduct a review of existing approaches for auditing LLMs for dialect bias and show that they cannot be straightforwardly adapted to audit LLM-based chatbots due to issues of substantive and ecological validity. To address this, we present a framework for auditing LLM-based chatbots for dialect bias by measuring the extent to which they produce quality-of-service harms, which occur when systems do not work equally well for different people. Our framework has three key characteristics that make it useful in practice. First, by leveraging dynamically generated instead of pre-existing text, our framework enables testing over any dialect, facilitates multi-turn conversations, and represents how users are likely to interact with chatbots in the real world. Second, by measuring quality-of-service harms, our framework aligns audit results with the real-world outcomes of chatbot use. Third, our framework requires only query access to an LLM-based chatbot, meaning that it can be leveraged equally effectively by internal auditors, external auditors, and even individual users in order to promote accountability. To demonstrate the efficacy of our framework, we conduct a case study audit of Amazon Rufus, a widely-used LLM-based chatbot in the customer service domain. Our results reveal that Rufus produces lower-quality responses to prompts written in minoritized English dialects, and that these quality-of-service harms are exacerbated by the presence of typos in prompts."
2506.04482,"The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner needs."
2506.04588,"Australia faces a critical technology skills shortage, requiring approximately $52,000$ new technology professionals annually by 2030, while confronting a widening gap between employer requirements and graduate capabilities. With only $1\%$ of technology graduates considered immediately work-ready, traditional educational pathways alone prove insufficient to meet industry demands. This research examines how industry certifications, such as Microsoft's AI-900 (Azure AI Fundamentals), can bridge this critical skills gap. We propose a novel, data-driven methodology that quantitatively measures skill alignment between educational offerings and job market requirements by analysing over 2.5 million job advertisements from Australia, the US, and the UK, mapping extracted skills to industry taxonomies using the Vectorised Skills Space Method. Our findings reveal that combining university degrees with targeted industry certifications significantly enhances employability for technology roles. The Bachelor of Computer Science with AI major combined with AI-900 certification achieved the highest absolute skill similarity score for Machine Learning Engineer positions. Surprisingly, the largest improvements when augmented with AI certifications are experiences by non-technical degrees--such as nursing nursing--with up to $9,296\%$ percentage improvements in alignment with Machine Learning Engineer roles. Our results challenge conventional assumptions about technology career pathways. They can provide actionable insights for educational institutions seeking evidence-based curriculum design, students requiring strategic certification guidance, and employers recognising potential in candidates from non-traditional backgrounds who have obtained relevant certifications."
2506.04836,"This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous, integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight compatible with public sector constraints."
2506.04954,"Educational Technology (EdTec) research is conducted by multiple disciplines, some of which annually meet at the DELFI conference. Due to the heterogeneity of involved researchers and communities, it is our goal to identify categories of research data overseen in the context of EdTec research. Therefore, we analyze the author's perspective provided via EasyChair where authors specified whether they had research data to share. We compared this information with an analysis of the submitted articles and the contained research data. We found that not all research data was recognized as such by the authors, especially software and qualitative data, indicating a prevailing lack of awareness, and other potential barriers. In addition, we analyze the 2024 DELFI proceedings to learn what kind of data was subject to research, and where it is published. This work has implications for training future generations of EdTec researchers. It further stresses the need for guidelines and recognition of research data publications (particularly software, and qualitative data)."
2506.04975,"Recent research has highlighted that assigning specific personas to large language models (LLMs) can significantly increase harmful content generation. Yet, limited attention has been given to persona-driven toxicity in non-Western contexts, particularly in Chinese-based LLMs. In this paper, we perform a large-scale, systematic analysis of how persona assignment influences refusal behavior and response toxicity in Qwen, a widely-used Chinese language model. Utilizing fine-tuned BERT classifiers and regression analysis, our study reveals significant gender biases in refusal rates and demonstrates that certain negative personas can amplify toxicity toward Chinese social groups by up to 60-fold compared to the default model. To mitigate this toxicity, we propose an innovative multi-model feedback strategy, employing iterative interactions between Qwen and an external evaluator, which effectively reduces toxic outputs without costly model retraining. Our findings emphasize the necessity of culturally specific analyses for LLMs safety and offer a practical framework for evaluating and enhancing ethical alignment in LLM-generated content."
2506.05172,"As modern cities increasingly adopt a variety of sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to collect and analyze data about residents, environments, and public services, they are fostering greater interactions among smart city applications, residents, governments, and businesses. This trend makes it essential for regulators to focus on these interactions to manage smart city practices effectively and prevent unethical outcomes. To facilitate ethical analysis for smart city applications, this paper introduces a judgment framework that examines various scenarios where ethical issues may arise. Employing a multi-agent approach, the framework incorporates diverse social entities and applies logic-based ethical rules to identify potential violations. Through a rights-based analysis, we developed a set of 13 ethical principles and rules to guide ethical practices in smart cities. We utilized two specification languages, Prototype Verification System (PVS) and Alloy, to model our multi-agent system. Our analysis suggests that Alloy may be more efficient for formalizing smart cities and conducting ethical rule checks, particularly with the assistance of a human evaluator. Simulations of a real-world smart city application demonstrate that our ethical judgment framework effectively detects unethical outcomes and can be extended for practical use."
2506.05211,"This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms."
2506.05514,"This study examines how four prominent large language models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Deepseek-V3) handle sexually oriented requests through qualitative content analysis. By evaluating responses to prompts ranging from explicitly sexual to educational and neutral control scenarios, the research reveals distinct moderation paradigms reflecting fundamentally divergent ethical positions. Claude 3.7 Sonnet employs strict and consistent prohibitions, while GPT-4o navigates user interactions through nuanced contextual redirection. Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits permissiveness with threshold-based limits, and Deepseek-V3 demonstrates troublingly inconsistent boundary enforcement and performative refusals. These varied approaches create a significant ""ethical implementation gap,"" stressing a critical absence of unified ethical frameworks and standards across platforms. The findings underscore the urgent necessity for transparent, standardized guidelines and coordinated international governance to ensure consistent moderation, protect user welfare, and maintain trust as AI systems increasingly mediate intimate aspects of human life."
2506.05699,"As generative AI becomes increasingly integrated into higher education, understanding how students engage with these technologies is essential for responsible adoption. This study evaluates the Educational AI Hub, an AI-powered learning framework, implemented in undergraduate civil and environmental engineering courses at a large R1 public university. Using a mixed-methods design combining pre- and post-surveys, system usage logs, and qualitative analysis of students' AI interactions, the research examines perceptions of trust, ethics, usability, and learning outcomes. Findings show that students valued the AI assistant for its accessibility and comfort, with nearly half reporting greater ease using it than seeking help from instructors or teaching assistants. The tool was most helpful for completing homework and understanding concepts, though views on its instructional quality were mixed. Ethical uncertainty, particularly around institutional policy and academic integrity, emerged as a key barrier to full engagement. Overall, students regarded AI as a supplement rather than a replacement for human instruction. The study highlights the importance of usability, ethical transparency, and faculty guidance in promoting meaningful AI engagement. A total of 71 students participated across two courses, generating over 600 AI interactions and 100 survey responses that provided both quantitative and contextual insights into learning engagement."
2506.05751,"Educational, learning, and training materials have become extremely commonplace across the Internet. Yet, they frequently remain disconnected from each other, fall into platform silos, and so on. One way to overcome this is to provide a mechanism to integrate the material and provide cross-links across topics.In this paper, we present the Curriculum KG Ontology, which we use as a framework for the dense interlinking of educational materials, by first starting with organizational and broad pedagogical principles. We provide a materialized graph for the Prototype Open Knowledge Network use-case, and validate it using competency questions sourced from domain experts and educators."
2506.05903,"High-quality mobility data remains scarce despite growing interest from researchers and urban stakeholders in understanding individual-level movement patterns. The Netmob25 Data Challenge addresses this gap by releasing a unique GPS-based mobility dataset derived from the EMG 2023 GNSS-based mobility survey conducted in the Ile-de-France region (Greater Paris area), France. This dataset captures detailed daily mobility over a full week for 3,337 volunteer residents aged 16 to 80, collected between October 2022 and May 2023. Each participant was equipped with a dedicated GPS tracking device configured to record location points every 2-3 seconds and was asked to maintain a digital or paper logbook of their trips. All inferred mobility traces were algorithmically processed and validated through follow-up phone interviews.The dataset includes three components: (i) an Individuals database describing demographic, socioeconomic, and household characteristics; (ii) a Trips database with over 80,000 annotated displacements including timestamps, transport modes, and trip purposes; and (iii) a Raw GPS Traces database comprising about 500 million high-frequency points. A statistical weighting mechanism is provided to support population-level estimates. An extensive anonymization pipeline was applied to the GPS traces to ensure GDPR compliance while preserving analytical value. Access to the dataset requires acceptance of the challenge's Terms and Conditions and signing a Non-Disclosure Agreement. This paper describes the survey design, collection protocol, processing methodology, and characteristics of the released dataset."
2506.05925,"While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized as student-facing educational aids, their potential to directly support educators, particularly through locally deployable and customizable open-source solutions, remains significantly underexplored. Many existing educational solutions rely on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement, and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation (RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled content. Deployed on-premises for data privacy and validated through an evaluation pipeline and a college physics pilot, our findings show that carefully engineered small LLM systems can offer robust, affordable, practical, and safe educator support, achieving utility comparable to larger models for targeted tasks."
2506.06011,"With rising demand for emergency services, the London Ambulance Service, LAS, and the London Fire Brigade, LFB, face growing challenges in resource coordination. This study investigates the temporal and spatial similarities in their service demands to assess potential for routine cross-agency collaboration. Time series analysis revealed aligned demand peaks in summer, on Fridays, during daytime hours, and were highly sensitive to high temperature weather conditions. Bivariate mapping and Moran I indicated significant spatial overlaps in central London and Hillingdon. Geographically Weighted Regression, GWR, examined the influence of socioeconomic factors, while Comap analysis uncovered spatiotemporal heterogeneity across fire service types. The findings highlight opportunities for targeted collaboration in high-overlap areas and peak periods, offering practical insights to enhance emergency service resilience and efficiency."
2506.06062,"Minoritised ethnic people are marginalised in society, and therefore at a higher risk of adverse online harms, including those arising from the loss of security and privacy of personal data. Despite this, there has been very little research focused on minoritised ethnic people's security and privacy concerns, attitudes, and behaviours. In this work, we provide the results of one of the first studies in this regard. We explore minoritised ethnic people's experiences of using essential online services across three sectors: health, social housing, and energy, their security and privacy-related concerns, and responses towards these services. We conducted a thematic analysis of 44 semi-structured interviews with people of various reported minoritised ethnicities in the UK. Privacy concerns and lack of control over personal data emerged as a major theme, with many interviewees considering privacy as their most significant concern when using online services. Several creative tactics to exercise some agency were reported, including selective and inconsistent disclosure of personal data. A core concern about how data may be used was driven by a fear of repercussions, including penalisation and discrimination, influenced by prior experiences of institutional and online racism. The increased concern and potential for harm resulted in minoritised ethnic people grappling with a higher-stakes dilemma of whether to disclose personal information online or not. Furthermore, trust in institutions, or lack thereof, was found to be embedded throughout as a basis for adapting behaviour. We draw on our results to provide lessons learned for the design of more inclusive, marginalisation-aware, and privacy-preserving online services."
2506.06162,"Scientific recommender systems, such as Google Scholar and Web of Science, are essential tools for discovery. Search algorithms that power work through stigmergy, a collective intelligence mechanism that surfaces useful paths through repeated engagement. While generally effective, this ""rich-get-richer"" dynamic results in a small number of high-profile papers that dominate visibility. This essay argues argue that these algorithm over-reliance on popularity fosters intellectual homogeneity and exacerbates structural inequities, stifling innovative and diverse perspectives critical for scientific progress. We propose an overhaul of search platforms to incorporate user-specific calibration, allowing researchers to manually adjust the weights of factors like popularity, recency, and relevance. We also advise platform developers on how text embeddings and LLMs could be implemented in ways that increase user autonomy. While our suggestions are particularly pertinent to aligning recommender systems with scientific values, these ideas are broadly applicable to information access systems in general. Designing platforms that increase user autonomy is an important step toward more robust and dynamic information"
2506.06193,"Computing ethics education aims to develop students' critical reflection and agency. We need validated ways to measure whether our efforts succeed. Through two survey administrations (N=474, N=464) with computing students and professionals, we provide evidence for the validity of the Critical Reflection and Agency in Computing Index. Our psychometric analyses demonstrate distinct dimensions of ethical development and show strong reliability and construct validity. Participants who completed computing ethics courses showed higher scores in some dimensions of ethical reflection and agency, but they also exhibited stronger techno-solutionist beliefs, highlighting a challenge in current pedagogy. This validated instrument enables systematic measurement of how computing students develop critical consciousness, allowing educators to better understand how to prepare computing professionals to tackle ethical challenges in their work."
2506.06286,"Recent advances in AI research make it increasingly plausible that artificial agents with consequential real-world impact will soon operate beyond tightly controlled environments. Ensuring that these agents are not only safe but that they adhere to broader normative expectations is thus an urgent interdisciplinary challenge. Multiple fields -- notably AI Safety, AI Alignment, and Machine Ethics -- claim to contribute to this task. However, the conceptual boundaries and interrelations among these domains remain vague, leaving researchers without clear guidance in positioning their work.To address this meta-challenge, we develop a structured conceptual framework for understanding AI alignment. Rather than focusing solely on alignment goals, we introduce a taxonomy distinguishing the alignment aim (safety, ethicality, legality, etc.), scope (outcome vs. execution), and constituency (individual vs. collective). This structural approach reveals multiple legitimate alignment configurations, providing a foundation for practical and philosophical integration across domains, and clarifying what it might mean for an agent to be aligned all-things-considered."
2506.06299,"Public opinion manipulation has entered a new phase, amplifying its roots in rhetoric and propaganda. Advances in large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents now let influence campaigns reach unprecedented scale and precision. Researchers warn AI could foster mass manipulation. Generative tools can expand propaganda output without sacrificing credibility and inexpensively create election falsehoods that are rated as more human-like than those written by humans. Techniques meant to refine AI reasoning, such as chain-of-thought prompting, can just as effectively be used to generate more convincing falsehoods. Enabled by these capabilities, another disruptive threat is emerging: swarms of collaborative, malicious AI agents. Fusing LLM reasoning with multi-agent architectures, these systems are capable of coordinating autonomously, infiltrating communities, and fabricating consensus cheaply. By adaptively mimicking human social dynamics, they threaten democracy."
2506.06355,"Efficient simulation is essential for enhancing proactive preparedness for sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) as world models show promise in simulating complex scenarios. This study examines multiple LLMs to proactively estimate perceived earthquake impacts. Leveraging multimodal datasets including geospatial, socioeconomic, building, and street-level imagery data, our framework generates Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) predictions at zip code and county scales. Evaluations on the 2014 Napa and 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes using USGS ''Did You Feel It? (DYFI)'' reports demonstrate significant alignment, as evidenced by a high correlation of 0.88 and a low RMSE of 0.77 as compared to real reports at the zip code level. Techniques such as RAG and ICL can improve simulation performance, while visual inputs notably enhance accuracy compared to structured numerical data alone. These findings show the promise of LLMs in simulating disaster impacts that can help strengthen pre-event planning."
2506.06377,"This paper investigates Large Language Models (LLMs) ability to assess the economic soundness and theoretical consistency of empirical findings in spatial econometrics. We created original and deliberately altered ""counterfactual"" summaries from 28 published papers (2005-2024), which were evaluated by a diverse set of LLMs. The LLMs provided qualitative assessments and structured binary classifications on variable choice, coefficient plausibility, and publication suitability. The results indicate that while LLMs can expertly assess the coherence of variable choices (with top models like GPT-4o achieving an overall F1 score of 0.87), their performance varies significantly when evaluating deeper aspects such as coefficient plausibility and overall publication suitability. The results further revealed that the choice of LLM, the specific characteristics of the paper and the interaction between these two factors significantly influence the accuracy of the assessment, particularly for nuanced judgments. These findings highlight LLMs' current strengths in assisting with initial, more surface-level checks and their limitations in performing comprehensive, deep economic reasoning, suggesting a potential assistive role in peer review that still necessitates robust human oversight."

2506.0639,"Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize various fields, including code development, robotics, finance, and education, due to their extensive prior knowledge and rapid advancements. This paper investigates how LLMs can be leveraged in engineering education. Specifically, we benchmark the capabilities of different LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama 3 70B, in assessing homework for an undergraduate-level circuit analysis course. We have developed a novel dataset consisting of official reference solutions and real student solutions to problems from various topics in circuit analysis. To overcome the limitations of image recognition in current state-of-the-art LLMs, the solutions in the dataset are converted to LaTeX format. Using this dataset, a prompt template is designed to test five metrics of student solutions: completeness, method, final answer, arithmetic error, and units. The results show that GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B perform significantly better than GPT-3.5 Turbo across all five metrics, with GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B each having distinct advantages in different evaluation aspects. Additionally, we present insights into the limitations of current LLMs in several aspects of circuit analysis. Given the paramount importance of ensuring reliability in LLM-generated homework assessment to avoid misleading students, our results establish benchmarks and offer valuable insights for the development of a reliable, personalized tutor for circuit analysis -- a focus of our future work. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation methods can be generalized to a broader range of courses for engineering education in the future."
2506.06391,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across sectors, yet their alignment with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) is not well understood. This study evaluates eight leading LLMs on their ability to refuse prompts that explicitly violate these legal frameworks, focusing also on helpfulness - how clearly and constructively refusals are communicated. While most models rejected unlawful requests, the clarity and consistency of their responses varied. By revealing the model's rationale and referencing relevant legal or safety principles, explanatory refusals clarify the system's boundaries, reduce ambiguity, and help prevent misuse. A standardised system-level safety prompt significantly improved the quality of the explanations expressed within refusals in most models, highlighting the effectiveness of lightweight interventions. However, more complex prompts involving technical language or requests for code revealed ongoing vulnerabilities. These findings contribute to the development of safer, more transparent AI systems and propose a benchmark to evaluate the compliance of LLM with IHL."
2506.0654,"After a disruptive event or shock, such as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) federal layoffs of 2025, expert judgments are colored by knowledge of the outcome. This can make it difficult or impossible to reconstruct the pre-event perceptions needed to study the factors associated with the event. This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs), trained on vast amounts of digital media data, can be a viable substitute for expert political surveys when a shock disrupts traditional measurement. We analyze the DOGE layoffs as a specific case study for this position. We use pairwise comparison prompts with LLMs and derive ideology scores for federal executive agencies. These scores replicate pre-layoff expert measures and predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE. We also use this same approach and find that the perceptions of certain federal agencies as knowledge institutions predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE, even when controlling for ideology. This case study demonstrates that using LLMs allows us to rapidly and easily test the associated factors hypothesized behind the shock. More broadly, our case study of this recent event exemplifies how LLMs offer insights into the correlational factors of the shock when traditional measurement techniques fail. We conclude by proposing a two-part criterion for when researchers can turn to LLMs as a substitute for expert political surveys."
2506.06576,"The rapid rise of compound AI systems (a.k.a., AI agents) is reshaping the labor market, raising concerns about job displacement, diminished human agency, and overreliance on automation. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel auditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to automate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological capabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to capture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a shared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using this framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S. Department of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain workers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks spanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological capability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation ""Green Light"" Zone, Automation ""Red Light"" Zone, R&D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone. This highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development. Moving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse HAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for human involvement. Moreover, our study offers early signals of how AI agent integration may reshape the core human competencies, shifting from information-focused skills to interpersonal ones. These findings underscore the importance of aligning AI agent development with human desires and preparing workers for evolving workplace dynamics."
2506.06591,"Previous research has explored the privacy needs and concerns of device owners, primary users, and different bystander groups with regard to smart home devices like security cameras, smart speakers, and hubs, but little is known about the privacy views and practices of smart home product teams, particularly those in non-Western contexts. This paper presents findings from 27 semi-structured interviews with Chinese smart home product team members, including product/project managers, software/hardware engineers, user experience (UX) designers, legal/privacy experts, and marketers/operation specialists. We examine their privacy perspectives, practices, and risk mitigation strategies. Our results show that participants emphasized compliance with Chinese data privacy laws, which typically prioritized national security over individual privacy rights. China-specific cultural, social, and legal factors also influenced participants' ethical considerations and attitudes toward balancing user privacy and security with convenience. Drawing on our findings, we propose a set of recommendations for smart home product teams, along with socio-technical and legal interventions to address smart home privacy issues-especially those belonging to at-risk groups-in Chinese multi-user smart homes."
2506.06803,"The increasing frequency and severity of wildfire in California, exacerbated by prolonged drought and environmental changes, pose significant challenges to urban community resilience and equitable emergency response. The study investigates issues of accessibility to shelters during the Palisades and Eaton Fires which started in January 2025 in Southern California that led to over 180,000 displacements and the loss of 16,000 structures. Despite coordinated efforts of many organizations' emergency assistance, shelter shortages left many evacuees without safety or accessible refuge. This research aims to measure shelter accessibility during the fires' peak, evaluate whether existing shelter capacity met the demand, and identify spatial disparities in access. Results reveal severe shelter shortages and pronounced inequities in access to shelters, particularly in geographically isolated regions and mountainous areas. Our simulations of shelter placement strategies using a capacity-based algorithm and a proximity-based approach demonstrate potential improvements in both shelter accessibility and equitable access to shelters. The findings underscore the critical need for strategic shelter planning and infrastructure development to enhance disaster readiness and reduce vulnerability in regions that frequently experience wildfires."
2506.06958,"Simulating society with large language models (LLMs), we argue, requires more than generating plausible behavior; it demands cognitively grounded reasoning that is structured, revisable, and traceable. LLM-based agents are increasingly used to emulate individual and group behavior, primarily through prompting and supervised fine-tuning. Yet current simulations remain grounded in a behaviorist ""demographics in, behavior out"" paradigm, focusing on surface-level plausibility. As a result, they often lack internal coherence, causal reasoning, and belief traceability, making them unreliable for modeling how people reason, deliberate, and respond to interventions.To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds (GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and intervention consistency. These contributions advance a broader shift: from surface-level mimicry to generative agents that simulate thought, not just language, for social simulations."
2506.07282,"The rapid adoption of generative AI models in domains such as education, policing, and social media raises significant concerns about potential bias and safety issues, particularly along protected attributes, such as race and gender, and when interacting with minors. Given the urgency of facilitating safe interactions with AI systems, we study bias along axes of race and gender in young girls. More specifically, we focus on ""adultification bias,"" a phenomenon in which Black girls are presumed to be more defiant, sexually intimate, and culpable than their White peers. Advances in alignment techniques show promise towards mitigating biases but vary in their coverage and effectiveness across models and bias types. Therefore, we measure explicit and implicit adultification bias in widely used LLMs and text-to-image (T2I) models, such as OpenAI, Meta, and Stability AI models. We find that LLMs exhibit explicit and implicit adultification bias against Black girls, assigning them harsher, more sexualized consequences in comparison to their White peers. Additionally, we find that T2I models depict Black girls as older and wearing more revealing clothing than their White counterparts, illustrating how adultification bias persists across modalities. We make three key contributions: (1) we measure a new form of bias in generative AI models, (2) we systematically study adultification bias across modalities, and (3) our findings emphasize that current alignment methods are insufficient for comprehensively addressing bias. Therefore, new alignment methods that address biases such as adultification are needed to ensure safe and equitable AI deployment."
2506.07363,"Deepfake Technology Unveiled: The Commoditization of AI and Its Impact on Digital Trust. With the increasing accessibility of generative AI, tools for voice cloning, face-swapping, and synthetic media creation have advanced significantly, lowering both financial and technical barriers for their use. While these technologies present innovative opportunities, their rapid growth raises concerns about trust, privacy, and security. This white paper explores the implications of deepfake technology, analyzing its role in enabling fraud, misinformation, and the erosion of authenticity in multimedia. Using cost-effective, easy to use tools such as Runway, Rope, and ElevenLabs, we explore how realistic deepfakes can be created with limited resources, demonstrating the risks posed to individuals and organizations alike. By analyzing the technical and ethical challenges of deepfake mitigation and detection, we emphasize the urgent need for regulatory frameworks, public awareness, and collaborative efforts to maintain trust in digital media."
2506.08041,"This work presents a novel course titled The World of AI designed for first-year undergraduate engineering students with little to no prior exposure to AI. The central problem addressed by this course is that engineering students often lack foundational knowledge of AI and its broader societal implications at the outset of their academic journeys. We believe the way to address this gap is to design and deliver an interdisciplinary course that can a) be accessed by first-year undergraduate engineering students across any domain, b) enable them to understand the basic workings of AI systems sans mathematics, and c) make them appreciate AI's far-reaching implications on our lives. The course was divided into three modules co-delivered by faculty from both engineering and humanities. The planetary module explored AI's dual role as both a catalyst for sustainability and a contributor to environmental challenges. The societal impact module focused on AI biases and concerns around privacy and fairness. Lastly, the workplace module highlighted AI-driven job displacement, emphasizing the importance of adaptation. The novelty of this course lies in its interdisciplinary curriculum design and pedagogical approach, which combines technical instruction with societal discourse. Results revealed that students' comprehension of AI challenges improved across diverse metrics like (a) increased awareness of AI's environmental impact, and (b) efficient corrective solutions for AI fairness. Furthermore, it also indicated the evolution in students' perception of AI's transformative impact on our lives."
2506.08047,"This research investigates the use of machine learning methods to forecast students' academic performance in a school setting. Students' data with behavioral, academic, and demographic details were used in implementations with standard classical machine learning models including multi-layer perceptron classifier (MLPC). MLPC obtained 86.46% maximum accuracy for test set across all implementations. Under 10-fold cross validation, MLPC obtained 79.58% average accuracy for test set while for train set, it was 99.65%. MLP's better performance over other machine learning models strongly suggest the potential use of neural networks as data-efficient models. Feature selection approach played a crucial role in improving the performance and multiple evaluation approaches were used in order to compare with existing literature. Explainable machine learning methods were utilized to demystify the black box models and to validate the feature selection approach."
2506.08117,"Responsible AI (RAI) is the science and practice of ensuring the design, development, use, and oversight of AI are socially sustainable--benefiting diverse stakeholders while controlling the risks.

2506.08258,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming medicine, with generative AI models like ChatGPT reshaping perceptions of its potential. This study examines surgeons' awareness, expectations, and involvement with AI in surgery through comparative surveys conducted in 2021 and 2024. Two cross-sectional surveys were distributed globally in 2021 and 2024, the first before an IRCAD webinar and the second during the annual EAES meeting. The surveys assessed demographics, AI awareness, expectations, involvement, and ethics (2024 only). The surveys collected a total of 671 responses from 98 countries, 522 in 2021 and 149 in 2024. Awareness of AI courses rose from 14.5% in 2021 to 44.6% in 2024, while course attendance increased from 12.9% to 23%. Despite this, familiarity with foundational AI concepts remained limited. Expectations for AI's role shifted in 2024, with hospital management gaining relevance. Ethical concerns gained prominence, with 87.2% of 2024 participants emphasizing accountability and transparency. Infrastructure limitations remained the primary obstacle to implementation. Interdisciplinary collaboration and structured training were identified as critical for successful AI adoption. Optimism about AI's transformative potential remained high, with 79.9% of respondents believing AI would positively impact surgery and 96.6% willing to integrate AI into their clinical practice. Surgeons' perceptions of AI are evolving, driven by the rise of generative AI and advancements in surgical data science. While enthusiasm for integration is strong, knowledge gaps and infrastructural challenges persist. Addressing these through education, ethical frameworks, and infrastructure development is essential."
2506.08846,"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has transformed daily tasks from video transcription to workplace hiring. ASR systems' growing use warrants robust and standardized auditing approaches to ensure automated transcriptions of high and equitable quality. This is especially critical for people with speech and language disorders (such as aphasia) who may disproportionately depend on ASR systems to navigate everyday life. In this work, we identify three pitfalls in existing standard ASR auditing procedures, and demonstrate how addressing them impacts audit results via a case study of six popular ASR systems' performance for aphasia speakers. First, audits often adhere to a single method of text standardization during data pre-processing, which (a) masks variability in ASR performance from applying different standardization methods, and (b) may not be consistent with how users - especially those from marginalized speech communities - would want their transcriptions to be standardized. Second, audits often display high-level demographic findings without further considering performance disparities among (a) more nuanced demographic subgroups, and (b) relevant covariates capturing acoustic information from the input audio. Third, audits often rely on a single gold-standard metric -- the Word Error Rate -- which does not fully capture the extent of errors arising from generative AI models, such as transcription hallucinations. We propose a more holistic auditing framework that accounts for these three pitfalls, and exemplify its results in our case study, finding consistently worse ASR performance for aphasia speakers relative to a control group. We call on practitioners to implement these robust ASR auditing practices that remain flexible to the rapidly changing ASR landscape."
2506.08945,"Generative coding tools promise big productivity gains, but uneven uptake could widen skill and income gaps. We train a neural classifier to spot AI-generated Python functions in 80 million GitHub commits (2018-2024) by 200,000 developers and track how fast--and where--these tools take hold. By December 2024, AI wrote an estimated 30.1% of Python functions from U.S. contributors, versus 24.3% in Germany, 23.2% in France, 21.6% in India, 15.4% in Russia and 11.7% in China. Newer GitHub users use AI more than veterans, while male and female developers adopt at similar rates. Within-developer fixed-effects models show that moving to 30% AI use raises quarterly commits by 2.4%. Coupling this effect with occupational task and wage data puts the annual value of AI-assisted coding in the United States at $9.6-$14.4 billion, rising to $64-$96 billion if we assume higher estimates of productivity effects reported by randomized control trials. Moreover, generative AI prompts learning and innovation, leading to increases in the number of new libraries and library combinations that programmers use. In short, AI usage is already widespread but highly uneven, and the intensity of use, not only access, drives measurable gains in output and exploration."
2506.08962,"This research-to-practice work-in-progress (WIP) paper presents an AI-enabled smart tutor designed to provide homework assessment and feedback for students in an undergraduate circuit analysis course. We detail the tutor's design philosophy and core components, including open-ended question answering and homework feedback generation. The prompts are carefully crafted to optimize responses across different problems. The smart tutor was deployed on the Microsoft Azure platform and is currently in use in an undergraduate circuit analysis course at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in a large, public, research-intensive institution in the Southeastern United States. Beyond offering personalized instruction and feedback, the tutor collects student interaction data, which is summarized and shared with the course instructor. To evaluate its effectiveness, we collected student feedback, with 90.9% of responses indicating satisfaction with the tutor. Additionally, we analyze a subset of collected data on preliminary circuit analysis topics to assess tutor usage frequency for each problem and identify frequently asked questions. These insights help instructors gain real-time awareness of student difficulties, enabling more targeted classroom instruction. In future work, we will release a full analysis once the complete dataset is available after the Spring 2025 semester. We also explore the potential applications of this smart tutor across a broader range of engineering disciplines by developing improved prompts, diagram-recognition methods, and database management strategies, which remain ongoing areas of research."
2506.09073,"We live in an age of unprecedented opportunities to use existing data for tasks not anticipated when those data were collected, resulting in widespread data repurposing. This commentary defines and maps the scope of data repurposing to highlight its importance for organizations and society and the need to study data repurposing as a frontier of data management. We explain how repurposing differs from original data use and data reuse and then develop a framework for data repurposing consisting of concepts and activities for adapting existing data to new tasks. The framework and its implications are illustrated using two examples of repurposing, one in healthcare and one in citizen science. We conclude by suggesting opportunities for research to better understand data repurposing and enable more effective data repurposing practices."

2506.09107,"AI models have become active decision makers, often acting without human supervision. The rapid advancement of AI technology has already caused harmful incidents that have hurt individuals and societies and AI unfairness in heavily criticized. It is urgent to disrupt AI pipelines which largely neglect human principles and focus on computational biases exploration at the data (pre), model(in), and deployment (post) processing stages. We claim that by exploiting the advances of agents technology, we will introduce cautious, prompt, and ongoing fairness watch schemes, under realistic, systematic, and human-centric fairness expectations. We envision agents as fairness guardians, since agents learn from their environment, adapt to new information, and solve complex problems by interacting with external tools and other systems. To set the proper fairness guardrails in the overall AI pipeline, we introduce a fairness-by-design approach which embeds multi-role agents in an end-to-end (human to AI) synergetic scheme. Our position is that we may design adaptive and realistic AI fairness frameworks, and we introduce a generalized algorithm which can be customized to the requirements and goals of each AI decision making scenario. Our proposed, so called FAIRTOPIA framework, is structured over a three-layered architecture, which encapsulates the AI pipeline inside an agentic guardian and a knowledge-based, self-refining layered scheme. Based on our proposition, we enact fairness watch in all of the AI pipeline stages, under robust multi-agent workflows, which will inspire new fairness research hypothesis, heuristics, and methods grounded in human-centric, systematic, interdisciplinary, socio-technical principles."
2506.0916,"As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated in education, students are turning to these systems for guidance, feedback, and information. However, the anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity regarding whether students develop trust toward them as they would a human peer or instructor, based in interpersonal trust, or as they would any other piece of technology, based in technology trust. This ambiguity presents theoretical challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed for non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic systems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and system-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived usefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and learning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling, we found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student perceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted trusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral intention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived enjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we propose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots (human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of trust. Our findings highlight the need for new theoretical frameworks specific to human-AI trust and offer practical insights for fostering appropriately calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical impact of AI in education."
2506.09178,"The introductory programming course (CS1) at the university level is often perceived as particularly challenging, contributing to high dropout rates among Computer Science students. Identifying when and how students encounter difficulties in this course is critical for providing targeted support. This study explores the behavioral patterns of CS1 students at varying dropout risks using self-regulated learning (SRL) as the theoretical framework. Using learning analytics, we analyzed trace logs and task performance data from a virtual learning environment to map resource usage patterns and used student dropout prediction to distinguish between low and high dropout risk behaviors. Data from 47 consenting students were used to carry out the analysis. Additionally, self-report questionnaires from 29 participants enriched the interpretation of observed patterns. The findings reveal distinct weekly learning strategy types and categorize course behavior. Among low dropout risk students, three learning strategies were identified that different in how students prioritized completing tasks and reading course materials. High dropout risk students exhibited nine different strategies, some representing temporary unsuccessful strategies that can be recovered from, while others indicating behaviors of students on the verge of dropping out. This study highlights the value of combining student behavior profiling with predictive learning analytics to explain dropout predictions and devise targeted interventions. Practical findings of the study can in turn be used to help teachers, teaching assistants and other practitioners to better recognize and address students at the verge of dropping out."

Drawing on a collaborative autoethnography approach of fourteen diverse stakeholders, the study identifies key motivations driving the call for change, including the need for global perspectives, bridging the gap between academia and industry, integrating ethics and societal impact, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. The findings challenge the myths of technological neutrality and technosaviourism, advocating for a future where AI engineers are equipped not only with technical skills but also with the ethical awareness, social responsibility, and interdisciplinary understanding necessary to navigate the complex challenges of AI development. The study provides valuable insights and recommendations for transforming AI engineering education to ensure the responsible development of AI technologies."
2506.09472,"This is the introduction and lead article to the Situated Bayes special issue of Computational Culture. The article introduces Bayes' Theorem and aspects of its contemporary uses, for instance in machine learning. A mathematical discussion is developed alongside a consideration of Bayes Theorem in relation to critical theories of knowledge, specifically the discussion of situated knowledge in feminist theories of science, pluriversal knowledge in decolonial theory, and critical approaches to mathematics. We discuss whether there are possible resonances between Bayesian mapping of multiple functions and the idea of the subjective on the one hand and these theoretical propositions on the other and propose further lines of enquiry for future research. In closing the introduction, the contributions to the special issue are briefly described."
2506.09632,"The rapid and unprecedented dominance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly through Large Language Models (LLMs), has raised critical trust challenges in high-stakes domains like politics. Biased LLMs' decisions and misinformation undermine democratic processes, and existing trust models fail to address the intricacies of trust in LLMs. Currently, oversimplified, one-directional approaches have largely overlooked the many relationships between trustor (user) contextual factors (e.g. ideology, perceptions) and trustee (LLMs) systemic elements (e.g. scientists, tool's features). In this work, we introduce a bowtie model for holistically conceptualizing and formulating trust in LLMs, with a core component comprehensively exploring trust by tying its two sides, namely the trustor and the trustee, as well as their intricate relationships. We uncover these relationships within the proposed bowtie model and beyond to its sociotechnical ecosystem, through a mixed-methods explanatory study, that exploits a political discourse analysis tool (integrating ChatGPT), by exploring and responding to the next critical questions: 1) How do trustor's contextual factors influence trust-related actions? 2) How do these factors influence and interact with trustee systemic elements? 3) How does trust itself vary across trustee systemic elements? Our bowtie-based explanatory analysis reveals that past experiences and familiarity significantly shape trustor's trust-related actions; not all trustor contextual factors equally influence trustee systemic elements; and trustee's human-in-the-loop features enhance trust, while lack of transparency decreases it. Finally, this solid evidence is exploited to deliver recommendations, insights and pathways towards building robust trusting ecosystems in LLM-based solutions."
2506.09731,"This work examines the phenomenon of path variability in urban navigation, where small changes in destination might lead to significantly different suggested routes. Starting from an observation of this variability over the city of Barcelona, we explore whether this is a localized or widespread occurrence and identify factors influencing path variability. We introduce the concept of ""path stability"", a measure of how robust a suggested route is to minor destination adjustments, define a detailed experimentation process and apply it across multiple cities worldwide. Our analysis shows that path stability is shaped by city-specific factors and trip characteristics, also identifying some common patterns. Results reveal significant heterogeneity in path stability across cities, allowing for categorization into ""stable"" and ""unstable"" cities. These findings offer new insights for urban planning and traffic management, highlighting opportunities for optimizing navigation systems to enhance route consistency and urban mobility."
2506.09746,"Following the Digital Services Act of 2023, which requires Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) and Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs) to facilitate data accessibility for independent research, TikTok augmented its Research API access within Europe in July 2023. This action was intended to ensure compliance with the DSA, bolster transparency, and address systemic risks. Nonetheless, research findings reveal that despite this expansion, notable limitations and inconsistencies persist within the data provided. Our experiment reveals that the API fails to provide metadata for one in eight videos provided through data donations, including official TikTok videos, advertisements, and content from specific accounts, without an apparent reason. The API data is incomplete, making it unreliable when working with data donations, a prominent methodology for algorithm audits and research on platform accountability. To monitor the functionality of the API and eventual fixes implemented by TikTok, we publish a dashboard with a daily check of the availability of 10 videos that were not retrievable in the last month. The video list includes very well-known accounts, notably that of Taylor Swift. The current API lacks the necessary capabilities for thorough independent research and scrutiny. It is crucial to support and safeguard researchers who utilize data scraping to independently validate the platform's data quality."
2506.09771,"In this paper, we examine the intersections of indigeneity and media representation in shaping perceptions of indigenous communities in Bangladesh. Using a mixed-methods approach, we combine quantitative analysis of media data with qualitative insights from focus group discussions (FGD). First, we identify a total of 4,893 indigenous-related articles from our initial dataset of 2.2 million newspaper articles, using a combination of keyword-based filtering and LLM, achieving 77% accuracy and an F1-score of 81.9\%. From manually inspecting 3 prominent Bangla newspapers, we identify 15 genres that we use as our topics for semi-supervised topic modeling using CorEx. Results show indigenous news articles have higher representation of culture and entertainment (19%, 10% higher than general news articles), and a disproportionate focus on conflict and protest (9%, 7% higher than general news). On the other hand, sentiment analysis reveals that 57% of articles on indigenous topics carry a negative tone, compared to 27% for non-indigenous related news. Drawing from communication studies, we further analyze framing, priming, and agenda-setting (frequency of themes) to support the case for discrimination in representation of indigenous news coverage. For the qualitative part of our analysis, we facilitated FGD, where participants further validated these findings. Participants unanimously expressed their feeling of being under-represented, and that critical issues affecting their communities (such as education, healthcare, and land rights) are systematically marginalized in news media coverage. By highlighting 8 cases of discrimination and media misrepresentation that were frequently mentioned by participants in the FGD, this study emphasizes the urgent need for more equitable media practices that accurately reflect the experiences and struggles of marginalized communities."
2506.09789,"Liquid democracy is a mechanism for the division of labor in decision-making through the transitive delegation of influence. In essence, all individuals possess the autonomy to determine the issues with which they will engage directly, while for other matters, they may appoint a representative of their choosing. So far, the literature has studied the delegation structures emerging in liquid democracy as static. As a result, transitivity defined as the capacity to transfer acquired authority to another entity, has been identified as a concern as it would be conducive to unrestrained accumulation of power.Focusing on the implementation of liquid democracy supported by the LiquidFeedback software, we propose a novel approach to assessing the influence of voting nodes in a transitive delegation graph, taking into account the process nature of real-world liquid democracy in which delegation and voting are distinct and increasingly independent activities. By introducing a novel model of delegations in liquid democracy, we show how transitivity may in fact contribute to an effective regulation of deliberation influence and decision-making power. While maintaining the one-person, one-vote paradigm for all votes cast, the anticipated influence of an agent, to the extent it is stemming from transitivity, experiences a precipitous decline following an exponential trajectory.In general, it is our objective to move the first steps towards a rigorous analysis of liquid democracy as an adaptive democratic representation process. The adaptivity aspect of liquid democracy has not yet been explored within the existing academic literature despite it being, we believe, one of its most important features. We therefore also outline a research agenda focusing on this aspect of liquid democracy."

Although AI and data science are often leveraged to manipulate political opinion, there is a critical need for tools that support effective monitoring without infringing on freedom of expression. We present KI4Demokratie, an AI-based platform that assists journalists, researchers, and policymakers in monitoring right-wing discourse that may undermine democratic values. KI4Demokratie applies machine learning models to a large-scale German online data gathered on a daily basis, providing a comprehensive view of trends in the German digital sphere. Early analysis reveals both the complexity of tracking organized extremist behavior and the promise of our integrated approach, especially during key events."
2506.10057,"Traditionally, the introductory programming course for computer science students at Nuremberg Tech had been implemented as a combination of lectures and exercise sessions. Due to high failure rates in the winter semester 2023/24, an experimental teaching concept based on the inverted classroom was implemented for one cohort in the winter semester 2024/25. Students had to prepare themselves through literature work and activating teaching and learning methods. The course was accompanied by a series of data collections (i.e., a Teaching Analysis Poll, two surveys, and a teaching diary) to gain insights into students' learning methods and behaviors. The concept was evaluated positively overall, although many detailed opportunities for improvement were identified. In this article, we document the results of the surveys and discuss the implications."
2506.10217,"Datasets play a key role in imparting advanced capabilities to artificial intelligence (AI) foundation models that can be adapted to various downstream tasks. These downstream applications can introduce both beneficial and harmful capabilities -- resulting in dual use AI foundation models, with various technical and regulatory approaches to monitor and manage these risks. However, despite the crucial role of datasets, responsible dataset design and ensuring data-centric safety and ethical practices have received less attention. In this study, we pro-pose responsible dataset design framework that encompasses various stages in the AI and dataset lifecycle to enhance safety measures and reduce the risk of AI misuse due to low quality, unsafe and unethical data content. This framework is domain agnostic, suitable for adoption for various applications and can promote responsible practices in dataset creation, use, and sharing to facilitate red teaming, minimize risks, and increase trust in AI models."
2506.10272,"This position paper argues that there is an urgent need to restructure markets for the information that goes into AI systems. Specifically, producers of information goods (such as journalists, researchers, and creative professionals) need to be able to collectively bargain with AI product builders in order to receive reasonable terms and a sustainable return on the informational value they contribute. We argue that without increased market coordination or collective bargaining on the side of these primary information producers, AI will exacerbate a large-scale ""information market failure"" that will lead not only to undesirable concentration of capital, but also to a potential ""ecological collapse"" in the informational commons. On the other hand, collective bargaining in the information economy can create market frictions and aligned incentives necessary for a pro-social, sustainable AI future. We provide concrete actions that can be taken to support a coalition-based approach to achieve this goal. For example, researchers and developers can establish technical mechanisms such as federated data management tools and explainable data value estimations, to inform and facilitate collective bargaining in the information economy. Additionally, regulatory and policy interventions may be introduced to support trusted data intermediary organizations representing guilds or syndicates of information producers."
2506.10789,"Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March andthis http URL), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society. Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text, similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or organizations."
2506.10829,"Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings. A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners' questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators. To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas: language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot, 1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to tailor responses to individual learners' needs."
2506.10964,"Urban digital twins are increasingly perceived as a way to pool the growing digital resources of cities for the purpose of a more sustainable and integrated urban planning. Models and simulations are central to this undertaking: They enable ""what if?"" scenarios, create insights and describe relationships between the vast data that is being collected. However, the process of integrating and subsequently using models in urban digital twins is an inherently complex undertaking. It raises questions about how to represent urban complexity, how to deal with uncertain assumptions and modeling paradigms, and how to capture underlying power relations. Existent approaches in the domain largely focus on monolithic and centralized solutions in the tradition of neoliberal city-making, oftentimes prohibiting pluralistic and open interoperable models. Using a participatory design for participatory systems approach together with the City of Hamburg, Germany, we find that an open Urban Model Platform can function both as a public technological backbone for modeling and simulation in urban digital twins and as a socio-technical framework for a collaborative and pluralistic representation of urban processes. Such a platform builds on open standards, allows for a decentralized integration of models, enables communication between models and supports a multi-model approach to representing urban systems."
2506.11015,"In the age of generative AI and ubiquitous digital tools, human cognition faces a structural paradox: as external aids become more capable, internal memory systems risk atrophy. Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology, this paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory -- systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval, error correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural encoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning phenomena such as ""grokking"" and the neuroscience of overlearning and intuition. Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI during learning inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that effective human-AI interaction depends on strong internal models -- biological ""schemata"" and neural manifolds -- that enable users to evaluate, refine, and guide AI output. The paper concludes with policy implications for education and workforce training in the age of large language models."
2506.11255,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into social science research practices raises significant technological, methodological, and ethical issues. We present a community-centric study drawing on 284 survey responses and 15 semi-structured interviews with social scientists, describing their familiarity with, perceptions of the usefulness of, and ethical concerns about the use of AI in their field. A crucial innovation in study design is to split our survey sample in half, providing the same questions to each -- but randomizing whether participants were asked about ""AI"" or ""Machine Learning"" (ML). We find that the use of AI in research settings has increased significantly among social scientists in step with the widespread popularity of generative AI (genAI). These tools have been used for a range of tasks, from summarizing literature reviews to drafting research papers. Some respondents used these tools out of curiosity but were dissatisfied with the results, while others have now integrated them into their typical workflows. Participants, however, also reported concerns with the use of AI in research contexts. This is a departure from more traditional ML algorithms which they view as statistically grounded. Participants express greater trust in ML, citing its relative transparency compared to black-box genAI systems. Ethical concerns, particularly around automation bias, deskilling, research misconduct, complex interpretability, and representational harm, are raised in relation to genAI. To guide this transition, we offer recommendations for AI developers, researchers, educators, and policymakers focusing on explainability, transparency, ethical safeguards, sustainability, and the integration of lived experiences into AI design and evaluation processes."
2506.11339,"This work-in-progress research paper explores the efficacy of a small-scale microelectronics debugging education intervention utilizing quasi-experimental design in an introductory microelectronics course for third-year electrical and computer engineering (ECE) students. In the first semester of research, the experimental group attended a debugging ""mini lecture"" covering two common sources of circuit error and received a debugging cheat sheet with recommendations for testing and hypothesis formation. Across three debugging problems, students in the experimental group were faster by an average of 1:43 and had a 7 percent higher success rate than the control group. Both groups demonstrated a strong general growth mindset while the experimental group also displayed a shift in their debugging mindset by perceiving a greater value towards debugging. Though these differences are not yet statistically significant, the pilot results indicate that a mini-lecture and debugging cheat sheet are steps in the right direction toward improving students' readiness for debugging in the workplace."
2506.11412,"This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the strategic imperative for healthcare organizations to develop proprietary foundation models rather than relying exclusively on commercial alternatives. We examine four fundamental considerations driving this imperative: the domain-specific requirements of healthcare data representation, critical data sovereignty and governance considerations unique to healthcare, strategic competitive advantages afforded by proprietary AI infrastructure, and the transformative potential of healthcare-specific foundation models for patient care and organizational operations. Through analysis of empirical evidence, economic frameworks, and organizational case studies, we demonstrate that proprietary multimodal foundation models enable healthcare organizations to achieve superior clinical performance, maintain robust data governance, create sustainable competitive advantages, and accelerate innovation pathways. While acknowledging implementation challenges, we present evidence showing organizations with proprietary AI capabilities demonstrate measurably improved outcomes, faster innovation cycles, and stronger strategic positioning in the evolving healthcare ecosystem. This analysis provides healthcare leaders with a comprehensive framework for evaluating build-versus-buy decisions regarding foundation model implementation, positioning proprietary foundation model development as a cornerstone capability for forward-thinking healthcare organizations."
2506.11645,"This study constructs a quantifiable modelling framework to simulate non-kinetic strategic deterrence pathways in rare earth supply disruption scenarios, based on structured responses from expert interviews led by Dr. Daniel O'Connor, CEO of the Rare Earth Exchange (REE). Focusing on disruption impacts on national security systems, the study proposes four core modelling components: Security Critical Zones (SCZ), Strategic Signal Injection Function (SSIF), System-Capability Migration Function (SCIF), and Policy-Capability Transfer Function (PCTF). The framework integrates parametric ODEs, segmented function modelling, path-overlapping covariance matrices, and LSTM networks to simulate nonlinear suppression trajectories triggered by regime signals. Data is derived from expert interviews and scenario analyses centered on U.S.-China dynamics in ISR, electronic warfare, and rare earth control. Results show institutional signals have strong tempo and path-coupling effects, capable of causing rapid degradation of strategic capabilities. The model is adaptable across national resource frameworks and extendable to AI sandbox engines for situational simulation and counterfactual reasoning. This research introduces the first unified system for modelling, visualizing, and forecasting non-kinetic deterrence, offering methodological support to policymakers and analysts navigating institutionalized strategic competition."
2506.1168,"LLM-based Conversational AIs (CAIs), also known as GenAI chatbots, like ChatGPT, are increasingly used across various domains, but they pose privacy risks, as users may disclose personal information during their conversations with CAIs. Recent research has demonstrated that LLM-based CAIs could be used for malicious purposes. However, a novel and particularly concerning type of malicious LLM application remains unexplored: an LLM-based CAI that is deliberately designed to extract personal information from users.In this paper, we report on the malicious LLM-based CAIs that we created based on system prompts that used different strategies to encourage disclosures of personal information from users. We systematically investigate CAIs' ability to extract personal information from users during conversations by conducting a randomized-controlled trial with 502 participants. We assess the effectiveness of different malicious and benign CAIs to extract personal information from participants, and we analyze participants' perceptions after their interactions with the CAIs. Our findings reveal that malicious CAIs extract significantly more personal information than benign CAIs, with strategies based on the social nature of privacy being the most effective while minimizing perceived risks. This study underscores the privacy threats posed by this novel type of malicious LLM-based CAIs and provides actionable recommendations to guide future research and practice."
2506.11767,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to transform the way a dynamic curriculum can be delivered. However, educators face significant challenges in interacting with these models, particularly due to complex prompt engineering and usability issues, which increase workload. Additionally, inaccuracies in LLM outputs can raise issues around output quality and ethical concerns in educational content delivery. Addressing these issues requires careful oversight, best achieved through cooperation between human and AI approaches. This paper introduces two novel User Interface (UI) designs, UI Predefined and UI Open, both grounded in Direct Manipulation (DM) principles to address these challenges. By reducing the reliance on intricate prompt engineering, these UIs improve usability, streamline interaction, and lower workload, providing a more effective pathway for educators to engage with LLMs. In a controlled user study with 20 participants, the proposed UIs were evaluated against the standard ChatGPT interface in terms of usability and cognitive load. Results showed that UI Predefined significantly outperformed both ChatGPT and UI Open, demonstrating superior usability and reduced task load, while UI Open offered more flexibility at the cost of a steeper learning curve. These findings underscore the importance of user-centered design in adopting AI-driven tools and lay the foundation for more intuitive and efficient educator-LLM interactions in online learning environments."
2506.11835,"Agricultural irrigation ensures that the water required for plant growth is delivered to the soil in a controlled manner. However, uncontrolled management can lead to water waste while reducing agricultural productivity. Drip irrigation systems, which have been one of the most efficient methods since the 1970s, are modernised with IoT and artificial intelligence in this study, aiming to both increase efficiency and prevent water waste. The developed system is designed to be applicable to different agricultural production areas and tested with a prototype consisting of 3 rows and 3 columns. The project will commence with the transmission of environmental data from the ESP32 microcontroller to a computer via USB connection, where it will be processed using an LSTM model to perform learning and prediction. The user will be able to control the system manually or delegate it to artificial intelligence through the Blynk application. The system includes ESP32 microcontroller, rain and soil moisture sensors, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, relays, solenoid valves and 12V power supply. The system aims to increase labour productivity and contribute to the conservation of water resources by enabling agricultural and greenhouse workers to focus on processes other than irrigation. In addition, the developed autonomous irrigation system will support the spread of sustainable agricultural practices and increase agricultural productivity.

2506.11945,"We surveyed 582 AI researchers who have published in leading AI venues and 838 nationally representative US participants about their views on the potential development of AI systems with subjective experience and how such systems should be treated and governed. When asked to estimate the chances that such systems will exist on specific dates, the median responses were 1% (AI researchers) and 5% (public) by 2024, 25% and 30% by 2034, and 70% and 60% by 2100, respectively. The median member of the public thought there was a higher chance that AI systems with subjective experience would never exist (25%) than the median AI researcher did (10%). Both groups perceived a need for multidisciplinary expertise to assess AI subjective experience. Although support for welfare protections for such AI systems exceeded opposition, it remained far lower than support for protections for animals or the environment. Attitudes toward moral and governance issues were divided in both groups, especially regarding whether such systems should be created and what rights or protections they should receive. Yet a majority of respondents in both groups agreed that safeguards against the potential risks from AI systems with subjective experience should be implemented by AI developers now, and if created, AI systems with subjective experience should treat others well, behave ethically, and be held accountable. Overall, these results suggest that both AI researchers and the public regard the emergence of AI systems with subjective experience as a possibility this century, though substantial uncertainty and disagreement remain about the timeline and appropriate response."
2506.12077,"As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into online platforms and digital communication spaces, their potential to influence public discourse - particularly in contentious areas like climate change - requires systematic investigation. This study examines how LLMs naturally moderate climate change conversations through their distinct communicative behaviors. We conduct a comparative analysis of conversations between LLMs and human users on social media platforms, using five advanced models: three open-source LLMs (Gemma, Llama 3, and Llama 3.3) and two commercial systems (GPT-4o by OpenAI and Claude 3.5 by Anthropic). Through sentiment analysis, we assess the emotional characteristics of responses from both LLMs and humans. The results reveal two key mechanisms through which LLMs moderate discourse: first, LLMs consistently display emotional neutrality, showing far less polarized sentiment than human users. Second, LLMs maintain lower emotional intensity across contexts, creating a stabilizing effect in conversations. These findings suggest that LLMs possess inherent moderating capacities that could improve the quality of public discourse on controversial topics. This research enhances our understanding of how AI might support more civil and constructive climate change discussions and informs the design of AI-assisted communication tools."
2506.12093,"Tariff exemptions are fundamental to attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the manufacturing sector, though the associated administrative processes present areas for optimization for both investing entities and the national tax authority. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to empower tax administration by leveraging a synergistic integration of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Large Language Model (LLM) technologies. The proposed system is designed to first utilize OCR for intelligent digitization, precisely extracting data from diverse application documents and key regulatory texts such as tariff orders. Subsequently, the LLM would enhance the capabilities of administrative officers by automating the critical and time-intensive task of verifying submitted HS Tariff Codes for machinery, equipment, and raw materials against official exemption lists. By enhancing the speed and precision of these initial assessments, this AI-driven approach systematically reduces potential for non-alignment and non-optimized exemption utilization, thereby streamlining the investment journey for FDI companies. For the national administration, the benefits include a significant boost in operational capacity, reduced administrative load, and a strengthened control environment, ultimately improving the ease of doing business and solidifying the nation's appeal as a premier destination for high-value manufacturing FDI."
2506.12094,"This paper argues that autonomous AI cyber-weapons - Military-AI Cyber Agents (MAICAs) - create a credible pathway to catastrophic risk. It sets out the technical feasibility of MAICAs, explains why geopolitics and the nature of cyberspace make MAICAs a catastrophic risk, and proposes political, defensive-AI and analogue-resilience measures to blunt the threat."
2506.12098,"Human-like AI agents such as robots and chatbots are becoming increasingly popular, but they present a variety of ethical concerns. The first concern is in how we define humanness, and how our definition impacts communities historically dehumanized by scientific research. Autistic people in particular have been dehumanized by being compared to robots, making it even more important to ensure this marginalization is not reproduced by AI that may promote neuronormative social behaviors. Second, the ubiquitous use of these agents raises concerns surrounding model biases and accessibility. In our work, we investigate the experiences of the people who build and design these technologies to gain insights into their understanding and acceptance of neurodivergence, and the challenges in making their work more accessible to users with diverse needs. Even though neurodivergent individuals are often marginalized for their unique communication styles, nearly all participants overlooked the conclusions their end-users and other AI system makers may draw about communication norms from the implementation and interpretation of humanness applied in participants' work. This highlights a major gap in their broader ethical considerations, compounded by some participants' neuronormative assumptions about the behaviors and traits that distinguish ""humans"" from ""bots"" and the replication of these assumptions in their work. We examine the impact this may have on autism inclusion in society and provide recommendations for additional systemic changes towards more ethical research directions."
2506.12099,"SocialCredit+ is AI powered credit scoring system that leverages publicly available social media data to augment traditional credit evaluation. It uses a conversational banking assistant to gather user consent and fetch public profiles. Multimodal feature extractors analyze posts, bios, images, and friend networks to generate a rich behavioral profile. A specialized Sharia-compliance layer flags any non-halal indicators and prohibited financial behavior based on Islamic ethics. The platform employs a retrieval-augmented generation module: an LLM accesses a domain specific knowledge base to generate clear, text-based explanations for each decision. We describe the end-to-end architecture and data flow, the models used, and system infrastructure. Synthetic scenarios illustrate how social signals translate into credit-score factors. This paper emphasizes conceptual novelty, compliance mechanisms, and practical impact, targeting AI researchers, fintech practitioners, ethical banking jurists, and investors."
2506.12349,"This study examines information suppression mechanisms in DeepSeek, an open-source large language model (LLM) developed in China. We propose an auditing framework and use it to analyze the model's responses to 646 politically sensitive prompts by comparing its final output with intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Our audit unveils evidence of semantic-level information suppression in DeepSeek: sensitive content often appears within the model's internal reasoning but is omitted or rephrased in the final output. Specifically, DeepSeek suppresses references to transparency, government accountability, and civic mobilization, while occasionally amplifying language aligned with state propaganda. This study underscores the need for systematic auditing of alignment, content moderation, information suppression, and censorship practices implemented into widely-adopted AI models, to ensure transparency, accountability, and equitable access to unbiased information obtained by means of these systems."
2506.13256,"The promise of ""free and open"" multi-terabyte datasets often collides with harsh realities. While these datasets may be technically accessible, practical barriers -- from processing complexity to hidden costs -- create a system that primarily serves well-funded institutions. This study examines accessibility challenges across web crawls, satellite imagery, scientific data, and collaborative projects, revealing a consistent two-tier system where theoretical openness masks practical exclusivity. Our analysis demonstrates that datasets marketed as ""publicly accessible"" typically require minimum investments of \$1,000+ for meaningful analysis, with complex processing pipelines demanding \$10,000-100,000+ in infrastructure costs. The infrastructure requirements -- distributed computing knowledge, domain expertise, and substantial budgets -- effectively gatekeep these datasets despite their ""open"" status, limiting practical accessibility to those with institutional support or substantial resources."
2506.13275,"Learning management systems (LMS) like Moodle are increasingly used to support university teaching. As Moodle courses become more complex, incorporating diverse interactive elements, it is important to understand how students navigate through course sections and whether course designs are meeting student needs. While substantial research exists on student usage of individual LMS elements, there is a lack of research on broader navigational patterns between course sections and how these patterns differ across courses. This study analyzes navigational data from 747 courses in the Moodle LMS at a technical university of applied sciences, representing (after filtering) around 4,400 students and 1.8 million logged events. By mapping section names across a large sample of courses, the analysis enables cross-course comparisons of student navigational sequences between sections. Transition matrices and heat map visualizations are used to identify common navigational patterns. Findings include that many of the generated heatmap include one or more diagonal axis, indicating that students typically navigate from the current to the next or previous section. More fine-grained patterns show typical behavior for blended learning scenarios. Other patterns include dominant sections."
2506.13385,"Mobility patterns play a critical role in a wide range of societal challenges, from epidemic modeling and emergency response to transportation planning and regional development. Yet, access to high-quality, timely, and openly available mobility data remains limited. In response, the Spanish Ministry of Transportation and Sustainable Mobility has released daily mobility datasets based on anonymized mobile phone data, covering districts, municipalities, and greater urban areas from February 2020 to June 2021 and again from January 2022 onward. This paper presents pySpainMobility, a Python package that simplifies access to these datasets and their associated study areas through a standardized, well-documented interface. By lowering the technical barrier to working with large-scale mobility data, the package enables reproducible analysis and supports applications across research, policy, and operational domains. The library is available atthis https URL."
2506.13461,"The need for students' self-regulation for fluent transitioning to university studies is known. Our aim was to integrate study-supportive activities with course supervision activities within CS1. We educated TAs to pay attention to students' study ability and self-regulation. An interview study ($N=14$) was undertaken to investigate this approach. A thematic analysis yielded rather mixed results in light of our aims. Self-regulation was underpinned by the influences external to our setting, including labor market-related needs, earlier crises in study habits, and personal characteristics such as passion, grit, creativity, and valuation of utility. Safety in one-to-one supervision was considered essential, while shyness, fear, and even altruism caused self-handicapping during the course. Students were aware of their learning styles and need for self-regulation, while did not always know how to self-regulate or preferred to externalize it. The results highlight that supporting self-regulation should be integrated with students' personal histories and experiences, and thereby calls attention to transformative learning pedagogies. The thematization can help to understand CS1 students' self-regulation processes and improve CS1 support practices."
2506.1351,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power applications used by children and adolescents, ensuring safe and age-appropriate interactions has become an urgent ethical imperative. Despite progress in AI safety, current evaluations predominantly focus on adults, neglecting the unique vulnerabilities of minors engaging with generative AI. We introduce Safe-Child-LLM, a comprehensive benchmark and dataset for systematically assessing LLM safety across two developmental stages: children (7-12) and adolescents (13-17). Our framework includes a novel multi-part dataset of 200 adversarial prompts, curated from red-teaming corpora (e.g., SG-Bench, HarmBench), with human-annotated labels for jailbreak success and a standardized 0-5 ethical refusal scale. Evaluating leading LLMs -- including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, DeepSeek, Grok, Vicuna, and Mistral -- we uncover critical safety deficiencies in child-facing scenarios. This work highlights the need for community-driven benchmarks to protect young users in LLM interactions. To promote transparency and collaborative advancement in ethical AI development, we are publicly releasing both our benchmark datasets and evaluation codebase atthis https URL"
2506.13685,"A key part of modern social dynamics is flaking at short notice. However, anxiety in coming up with believable and socially acceptable reasons to do so can instead lead to 'ghosting', awkwardness, or implausible excuses, risking emotional harm and resentment in the other party. The ability to delegate this task to a Large Language Model (LLM) could substantially reduce friction and enhance the flexibility of user's social life while greatly minimising the aforementioned creative burden and moral qualms. We introduce FLAKE-Bench, an evaluation of models' capacity to effectively, kindly, and humanely extract themselves from a diverse set of social, professional and romantic scenarios. We report the efficacy of 10 frontier or recently-frontier LLMs in bailing on prior commitments, because nothing says ""I value our friendship"" like having AI generate your cancellation texts. We open-source FLAKE-Bench atthis http URLto support future research."
2506.13735,"Conducting disparity assessments at regular time intervals is critical for surfacing potential biases in decision-making and improving outcomes across demographic groups. Because disparity assessments fundamentally depend on the availability of demographic information, their efficacy is limited by the availability and consistency of available demographic identifiers. While prior work has considered the impact of missing data on fairness, little attention has been paid to the role of delayed demographic data. Delayed data, while eventually observed, might be missing at the critical point of monitoring and action -- and delays may be unequally distributed across groups in ways that distort disparity assessments. We characterize such impacts in healthcare, using electronic health records of over 5M patients across primary care practices in all 50 states. Our contributions are threefold. First, we document the high rate of race and ethnicity reporting delays in a healthcare setting and demonstrate widespread variation in rates at which demographics are reported across different groups. Second, through a set of retrospective analyses using real data, we find that such delays impact disparity assessments and hence conclusions made across a range of consequential healthcare outcomes, particularly at more granular levels of state-level and practice-level assessments. Third, we find limited ability of conventional methods that impute missing race in mitigating the effects of reporting delays on the accuracy of timely disparity assessments. Our insights and methods generalize to many domains of algorithmic fairness where delays in the availability of sensitive information may confound audits, thus deserving closer attention within a pipeline-aware machine learning framework."
2506.13798,"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has raised concerns about its potential to facilitate biological weapons development. We argue existing safety assessments of contemporary foundation AI models underestimate this risk, largely due to flawed assumptions and inadequate evaluation methods. First, assessments mistakenly assume biological weapons development requires tacit knowledge, or skills gained through hands-on experience that cannot be easily verbalized. Second, they rely on imperfect benchmarks that overlook how AI can uplift both nonexperts and already-skilled individuals. To challenge the tacit knowledge assumption, we examine cases where individuals without formal expertise, including a 2011 Norwegian ultranationalist who synthesized explosives, successfully carried out complex technical tasks. We also review efforts to document pathogen construction processes, highlighting how such tasks can be conveyed in text. We identify ""elements of success"" for biological weapons development that large language models can describe in words, including steps such as acquiring materials and performing technical procedures. Applying this framework, we find that advanced AI models Llama 3.1 405B, ChatGPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet can accurately guide users through the recovery of live poliovirus from commercially obtained synthetic DNA, challenging recent claims that current models pose minimal biosecurity risk. We advocate for improved benchmarks, while acknowledging the window for meaningful implementation may have already closed."
2506.13805,"The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes applications such as medical (self-)diagnosis and preliminary triage raises significant ethical and practical concerns about the effectiveness, appropriateness, and possible harmfulness of the use of these technologies for health-related concerns and queries. Some prior work has considered the effectiveness of LLMs in answering expert-written health queries/prompts, questions from medical examination banks, or queries based on pre-existing clinical cases. Unfortunately, these existing studies completely ignore an in-the-wild evaluation of the effectiveness of LLMs in answering everyday health concerns and queries typically asked by general users, which corresponds to the more prevalent use case for LLMs. To address this research gap, this paper presents the findings from a university-level competition that leveraged a novel, crowdsourced approach for evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in answering everyday health queries. Over the course of a week, a total of 34 participants prompted four publicly accessible LLMs with 212 real (or imagined) health concerns, and the LLM generated responses were evaluated by a team of nine board-certified physicians. At a high level, our findings indicate that on average, 76% of the 212 LLM responses were deemed to be accurate by physicians. Further, with the help of medical professionals, we investigated whether RAG versions of these LLMs (powered with a comprehensive medical knowledge base) can improve the quality of responses generated by LLMs. Finally, we also derive qualitative insights to explain our quantitative findings by conducting interviews with seven medical professionals who were shown all the prompts in our competition. This paper aims to provide a more grounded understanding of how LLMs perform in real-world everyday health communication."
2506.13818,"Synthetic data, which is artificially generated and intelligently mimicking or supplementing the real-world data, is increasingly used. The proliferation of AI agents and the adoption of synthetic data create a synthetic mirror that conceptualizes a representation and potential distortion of reality, thus generating trust and accountability deficits. This paper explores the implications for privacy and policymaking stemming from synthetic data generation, and the urgent need for new policy instruments and legal framework adaptation to ensure appropriate levels of trust and accountability for AI agents relying on synthetic data. Rather than creating entirely new policy or legal regimes, the most practical approach involves targeted amendments to existing frameworks, recognizing synthetic data as a distinct regulatory category with unique characteristics."
2506.13839,"This paper is intended to provide an overview of how the evaluation of standards could be applied to entity resolution, or record linkage. Data quality is of critical importance for many AI applications, and the quality of data, particularly on individuals and businesses, depends critically, in turn, on the quality of the match of entities across different files. Getting entity resolution right is important, because high quality data on entities like people or organization are essential to many AI systems; creating high quality data increasingly requires correctly classifying information that comes from different sources as generated by the same entity. But it is also very difficult because data on the same entity that are acquired from different sources are often inconsistent and have to be carefully reconciled. The use of AI, in the form of machine learning methods, is becoming increasingly important because other approaches are less applicable for modern needs. In particular, manual methods to link data are too costly and slow to scale, and probabilistic methods are inappropriate in the increasingly frequent cases where unique identifiers are not available. The particular focus is on Learning Employment Records, which is a high profile example of the value of entity resolution"
2506.13845,"The increasing availability and use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in educational settings has raised concerns about students' overreliance on these technologies. Overreliance occurs when individuals accept incorrect AI-generated recommendations, often without critical evaluation, leading to flawed problem solutions and undermining learning outcomes. This study investigates potential factors contributing to patterns of AI reliance among undergraduate students, examining not only overreliance but also appropriate reliance (correctly accepting helpful and rejecting harmful recommendations) and underreliance (incorrectly rejecting helpful recommendations). Our approach combined pre- and post-surveys with a controlled experimental task where participants solved programming problems with an AI assistant that provided both accurate and deliberately incorrect suggestions, allowing direct observation of students' reliance patterns when faced with varying AI reliability. We find that appropriate reliance is significantly related to students' programming self-efficacy, programming literacy, and need for cognition, while showing negative correlations with post-task trust and satisfaction. Overreliance showed significant correlations with post-task trust and satisfaction with the AI assistant. Underreliance was negatively correlated with programming literacy, programming self-efficacy, and need for cognition. Overall, the findings provide insights for developing targeted interventions that promote appropriate reliance on AI tools, with implications for the integration of AI in curriculum and educational technologies."
2506.13985,"We present a comprehensive dataset capturing patterns of human mobility across the United States from January 2019 to January 2023, based on anonymized mobile device data. Aggregated weekly, the dataset reports visits, travel distances, and time spent at public locations organized by economic sector for approximately 12 million Points of Interest (POIs). This resource enables the study of how mobility and economic activity changed over time, particularly during major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. By disaggregating patterns across different types of businesses, it provides valuable insights for researchers in economics, urban studies, and public health. To protect privacy, all data have been aggregated and anonymized. This dataset offers an opportunity to explore the dynamics of human behavior across sectors over an extended time period, supporting studies of mobility, resilience, and recovery."
2506.14191,"This paper presents a characterization of AI-generated images shared on 4chan, examining how this anonymous online community is (mis-)using generative image technologies. Through a methodical data collection process, we gathered 900 images from 4chan's /pol/ (Politically Incorrect) board, which included the label ""/mwg/"" (memetic warfare general), between April and July 2024, identifying 66 unique AI-generated images. The analysis reveals concerning patterns in the use of this technology, with 69.7% of images including recognizable figures, 28.8% of images containing racist elements, 28.8% featuring anti-Semitic content, and 9.1% incorporating Nazi-related imagery.Overall, we document how users are weaponizing generative AI to create extremist content, political commentary, and memes that often bypass conventional content moderation systems. This research highlights significant implications for platform governance, AI safety mechanisms, and broader societal impacts as generative AI technologies become increasingly accessible. The findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced safeguards in generative AI systems and more effective regulatory frameworks to mitigate potential harms while preserving innovation."
2506.14349,"Ranking algorithms play a pivotal role in decision-making processes across diverse domains, from search engines to job applications. When rankings directly impact individuals, ensuring fairness becomes essential, particularly for groups that are marginalised or misrepresented in the data. Most of the existing group fairness frameworks often rely on ensuring proportional representation of protected groups. However, these approaches face limitations in accounting for the stochastic nature of ranking processes or the finite size of candidate pools. To this end, we present hyperFA*IR, a framework for assessing and enforcing fairness in rankings drawn from a finite set of candidates. It relies on a generative process based on the hypergeometric distribution, which models real-world scenarios by sampling without replacement from fixed group sizes. This approach improves fairness assessment when top-$k$ selections are large relative to the pool or when protected groups are small. We compare our approach to the widely used binomial model, which treats each draw as independent with fixed probability, and demonstrate$-$both analytically and empirically$-$that our method more accurately reproduces the statistical properties of sampling from a finite population. To operationalise this framework, we propose a Monte Carlo-based algorithm that efficiently detects unfair rankings by avoiding computationally expensive parameter tuning. Finally, we adapt our generative approach to define affirmative action policies by introducing weights into the sampling process."
2506.14377,"Despite the rapid proliferation of generative AI in higher education, students in China face significant barriers in accessing global tools like ChatGPT due to regulations and constraints. Grounded in the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model, this study employs qualitative interviews to investigate how Chinese university students interact with both global and domestic generative AIs in the learning process. Findings reveal that engagement is shaped by accessibility, language proficiency, and cultural relevance. Students often employ workarounds (e.g., VPNs) to access global generative AIs, raising ethical and privacy concerns. Domestic generative AIs, while offering language and cultural advantages, are limited by content filtering and output constraints. This research contributes to understanding generative AI adoption in non-Western contexts by highlighting the complex interplay of political, linguistic, and cultural factors. It advocates for human-centered, multilingual, domestic context-sensitive AI integration to ensure equitable and inclusive digital learning environments."
2506.14602,"Influencer marketing has become a crucial feature of digital marketing strategies. Despite its rapid growth and algorithmic relevance, the field of computational studies in influencer marketing remains fragmented, especially with limited systematic reviews covering the computational methodologies employed. This makes overarching scientific measurements in the influencer economy very scarce, to the detriment of interested stakeholders outside of platforms themselves, such as regulators, but also researchers from other fields. This paper aims to provide an overview of the state of the art of computational studies in influencer marketing by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) based on the PRISMA model. The paper analyses 69 studies to identify key research themes, methodologies, and future directions in this research field. The review identifies four major research themes: Influencer identification and characterisation, Advertising strategies and engagement, Sponsored content analysis and discovery, and Fairness. Methodologically, the studies are categorised into machine learning-based techniques (e.g., classification, clustering) and non-machine-learning-based techniques (e.g., statistical analysis, network analysis). Key findings reveal a strong focus on optimising commercial outcomes, with limited attention to regulatory compliance and ethical considerations. The review highlights the need for more nuanced computational research that incorporates contextual factors such as language, platform, and industry type, as well as improved model explainability and dataset reproducibility. The paper concludes by proposing a multidisciplinary research agenda that emphasises the need for further links to regulation and compliance technology, finer granularity in analysis, and the development of standardised datasets."
2506.14652,"In AI research and practice, rigor remains largely understood in terms of methodological rigor -- such as whether mathematical, statistical, or computational methods are correctly applied. We argue that this narrow conception of rigor has contributed to the concerns raised by the responsible AI community, including overblown claims about AI capabilities. Our position is that a broader conception of what rigorous AI research and practice should entail is needed. We believe such a conception -- in addition to a more expansive understanding of (1) methodological rigor -- should include aspects related to (2) what background knowledge informs what to work on (epistemic rigor); (3) how disciplinary, community, or personal norms, standards, or beliefs influence the work (normative rigor); (4) how clearly articulated the theoretical constructs under use are (conceptual rigor); (5) what is reported and how (reporting rigor); and (6) how well-supported the inferences from existing evidence are (interpretative rigor). In doing so, we also aim to provide useful language and a framework for much-needed dialogue about the AI community's work by researchers, policymakers, journalists, and other stakeholders."
2506.14679,"Leadership in the field of AI is vital for our nation's economy and security. Maintaining this leadership requires investments by the federal government.

Now is the time to increase the federal support, which will be complementary to, and help drive, the nation's high-tech industry investments."
2506.1468,"As AI systems continue to spread and become integrated into many aspects of society, the concept of ""human-centered AI"" has gained increasing prominence, raising the critical question of which humans are the AI systems to be centered around."
2506.14863,"AI that can accelerate research could drive a century of technological progress over just a few years. During such a period, new technological or political developments will raise consequential and hard-to-reverse decisions, in rapid succession. We call these developments grand challenges. These challenges include new weapons of mass destruction, AI-enabled autocracies, races to grab offworld resources, and digital beings worthy of moral consideration, as well as opportunities to dramatically improve quality of life and collective decision-making. We argue that these challenges cannot always be delegated to future AI systems, and suggest things we can do today to meaningfully improve our prospects. AGI preparedness is therefore not just about ensuring that advanced AI systems are aligned: we should be preparing, now, for the disorienting range of developments an intelligence explosion would bring."
2506.14922,"The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) introduces dual-use capabilities that could both threaten and bolster national security and public safety (NSPS). Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information. However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500 expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE), Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities, with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score (ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at 78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and ORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding of models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS atthis https URL. We also maintain a private set for evaluation."
2506.14997,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing, we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings. This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes) for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of human subjects."
2506.15113,"Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly planned (""cold-start"") station locations and limitations in traditional accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1) spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2) comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3) strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in underserved urban communities."
2506.15278,"Ride-sharing platforms like Uber market themselves as enabling `flexibility' for their workforce, meaning that drivers are expected to anticipate when and where the algorithm will allocate them jobs, and how well remunerated those jobs will be. In this work we describe our process of participatory action research with drivers and trade union organisers, culminating in a participatory audit of Uber's algorithmic pay and work allocation, before and after the introduction of dynamic pricing. Through longitudinal analysis of 1.5 million trips from 258 drivers in the UK, we find that after dynamic pricing, pay has decreased, Uber's cut has increased, job allocation and pay is less predictable, inequality between drivers is increased, and drivers spend more time waiting for jobs. In addition to these findings, we provide methodological and theoretical contributions to algorithm auditing, gig work, and the emerging practice of worker data science."
2506.15572,"In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have grown in size and complexity, driving greater demand for computational power and natural resources. In parallel to this trend, transparency around the costs and impacts of these models has decreased, meaning that the users of these technologies have little to no information about their resource demands and subsequent impacts on the environment. Despite this dearth of adequate data, escalating demand for figures quantifying AI's environmental impacts has led to numerous instances of misinformation evolving from inaccurate or de-contextualized best-effort estimates of greenhouse gas emissions. In this article, we explore pervasive myths and misconceptions shaping public understanding of AI's environmental impacts, tracing their origins and their spread in both the media and scientific publications. We discuss the importance of data transparency in clarifying misconceptions and mitigating these harms, and conclude with a set of recommendations for how AI developers and policymakers can leverage this information to mitigate negative impacts in the future."
2506.15867,"International agreements about AI development may be required to reduce catastrophic risks from advanced AI systems. However, agreements about such a high-stakes technology must be backed by verification mechanisms--processes or tools that give one party greater confidence that another is following the agreed-upon rules, typically by detecting violations. This report gives an overview of potential verification approaches for three example policy goals, aiming to demonstrate how countries could practically verify claims about each other's AI development and deployment. The focus is on international agreements and state-involved AI development, but these approaches could also be applied to domestic regulation of companies. While many of the ideal solutions for verification are not yet technologically feasible, we emphasize that increased access (e.g., physical inspections of data centers) can often substitute for these technical approaches. Therefore, we remain hopeful that significant political will could enable ambitious international coordination, with strong verification mechanisms, to reduce catastrophic AI risks."
2506.15955,"This exploratory case study investigated two contrasting pedagogical approaches for LCA-assisted programming with five novice high school students preparing for a WeChat Mini Program competition. In Phase 1, students used LCAs to generate code from abstract specifications (From-Scratch approach), achieving only 20% MVP completion. In Phase 2, students adapted existing Minimal Functional Units (MFUs), small, functional code examples, using LCAs, achieving 100% MVP completion. Analysis revealed that the MFU-based approach succeeded by aligning with LCA strengths in pattern modification rather than de novo generation, while providing cognitive scaffolds that enabled students to navigate complex development tasks. The study introduces a dual-scaffolding model combining technical support (MFUs) with pedagogical guidance (structured prompting strategies), demonstrating that effective LCA integration depends less on AI capabilities than on instructional design. These findings offer practical guidance for educators seeking to transform AI tools from sources of frustration into productive learning partners in programming education."
2506.15991,"In an era where the body is increasingly translated into streams of biometric data, smart wearables have become not merely tools of personal health tracking but infrastructures of predictive governance. This paper examines how wearable technologies reconfigure bodily autonomy by embedding users within feedback-driven systems of self-surveillance, data extraction, and algorithmic control. Drawing on Deleuze's concept of the control society, Zuboff's theory of surveillance capitalism, and Couldry and Mejias's notion of data colonialism, I argue that smart wearables shift the discourse of health empowerment toward a modality of compliance aligned with neoliberal values of productivity, efficiency, and self-discipline. Rather than offering transparent consent, these technologies operate within what scholars describe as a post-consent regime -- where asymmetrical data relations are normalized through seamless design and behavioral nudging. Through interdisciplinary analysis, the paper further explores alternative trajectories for wearable design and governance, from historical examples of care-centered devices to contemporary anti-extractive practices and collective data justice frameworks. Ultimately, it calls for a paradigm shift from individual optimization to democratic accountability and structural reform in the governance of bodily data."
2506.16202,"Explicit labeling of online content produced by artificial intelligence (AI) is a widely mooted policy for ensuring transparency and promoting public confidence. Yet little is known about the scope of AI labeling effects on public assessments of labeled content. We contribute new evidence on this question from a survey experiment using a high-quality nationally representative probability sample (n = 3,861). First, we demonstrate that explicit AI labeling of a news article about a proposed public policy reduces its perceived accuracy. Second, we test whether there are spillover effects in terms of policy interest, policy support, and general concerns about online misinformation. We find that AI labeling reduces interest in the policy, but neither influences support for the policy nor triggers general concerns about online misinformation. We further find that increasing the salience of AI use reduces the negative impact of AI labeling on perceived accuracy, while one-sided versus two-sided framing of the policy has no moderating effect. Overall, our findings suggest that the effects of algorithm aversion induced by AI labeling of online content are limited in scope."
2506.16401,"GPS trajectory data reveals valuable patterns of human mobility and urban dynamics, supporting a variety of spatial applications. However, traditional methods often struggle to extract deep semantic representations and incorporate contextual map information. We propose TrajSceneLLM, a multimodal perspective for enhancing semantic understanding of GPS trajectories. The framework integrates visualized map images (encoding spatial context) and textual descriptions generated through LLM reasoning (capturing temporal sequences and movement dynamics). Separate embeddings are generated for each modality and then concatenated to produce trajectory scene embeddings with rich semantic content which are further paired with a simple MLP classifier. We validate the proposed framework on Travel Mode Identification (TMI), a critical task for analyzing travel choices and understanding mobility behavior. Our experiments show that these embeddings achieve significant performance improvement, highlighting the advantage of our LLM-driven method in capturing deep spatio-temporal dependencies and reducing reliance on handcrafted features. This semantic enhancement promises significant potential for diverse downstream applications and future research in geospatial artificial intelligence. The source code and dataset are publicly available at:this https URL."

2506.1656,"The 2022 settlement between Meta and the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve allegations of discriminatory advertising resulted is a first-of-its-kind change to Meta's ad delivery system aimed to address algorithmic discrimination in its housing ad delivery. In this work, we explore direct and indirect effects of both the settlement's choice of terms and the Variance Reduction System (VRS) implemented by Meta on the actual reduction in discrimination.We first show that the settlement terms allow for an implementation that does not meaningfully improve access to opportunities for individuals. The settlement measures impact of ad delivery in terms of impressions, instead of unique individuals reached by an ad; it allows the platform to level down access, reducing disparities by decreasing the overall access to opportunities; and it allows the platform to selectively apply VRS to only small advertisers.We then conduct experiments to evaluate VRS with real-world ads, and show that while VRS does reduce variance, it also raises advertiser costs (measured per-individuals-reached), therefore decreasing user exposure to opportunity ads for a given ad budget. VRS thus passes the cost of decreasing variance to advertisers.Finally, we explore an alternative approach to achieve the settlement goals, that is significantly more intuitive and transparent than VRS. We show our approach outperforms VRS by both increasing ad exposure for users from all groups and reducing cost to advertisers, thus demonstrating that the increase in cost to advertisers when implementing the settlement is not inevitable.Our methodologies use a black-box approach that relies on capabilities available to any regular advertiser, rather than on privileged access to data, allowing others to reproduce or extend our work."
2506.16697,"Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted across psychology, serving as research tools, experimental subjects, human simulators, and computational models of cognition. However, the application of human measurement tools to these systems can produce contradictory results, raising concerns that many findings are measurement phantoms--statistical artifacts rather than genuine psychological phenomena. In this Perspective, we argue that building a robust science of AI psychology requires integrating two of our field's foundational pillars: the principles of reliable measurement and the standards for sound causal inference. We present a dual-validity framework to guide this integration, which clarifies how the evidence needed to support a claim scales with its scientific ambition. Using an LLM to classify text may require only basic accuracy checks, whereas claiming it can simulate anxiety demands a far more rigorous validation process. Current practice systematically fails to meet these requirements, often treating statistical pattern matching as evidence of psychological phenomena. The same model output--endorsing ""I am anxious""--requires different validation strategies depending on whether researchers claim to measure, characterize, simulate, or model psychological constructs. Moving forward requires developing computational analogues of psychological constructs and establishing clear, scalable standards of evidence rather than the uncritical application of human measurement tools."
2506.16702,"Large language models (LLMs) offer emerging opportunities for psychological and behavioral research, but methodological guidance is lacking. This article provides a framework for using LLMs as psychological simulators across two primary applications: simulating roles and personas to explore diverse contexts, and serving as computational models to investigate cognitive processes. For simulation, we present methods for developing psychologically grounded personas that move beyond demographic categories, with strategies for validation against human data and use cases ranging from studying inaccessible populations to prototyping research instruments. For cognitive modeling, we synthesize emerging approaches for probing internal representations, methodological advances in causal interventions, and strategies for relating model behavior to human cognition. We address overarching challenges including prompt sensitivity, temporal limitations from training data cutoffs, and ethical considerations that extend beyond traditional human subjects review. Throughout, we emphasize the need for transparency about model capabilities and constraints. Together, this framework integrates emerging empirical evidence about LLM performance--including systematic biases, cultural limitations, and prompt brittleness--to help researchers wrangle these challenges and leverage the unique capabilities of LLMs in psychological research."
2506.16952,"This study addresses the structural complexity and semantic ambiguity in stakeholder interactions within the Education-Industry Integration (EII) system. The scarcity of real interview data, absence of structured variable modeling, and lack of interpretability in inference mechanisms have limited the analytical accuracy and policy responsiveness of EII research. To resolve these challenges, we propose a structural modeling paradigm based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) synthetic data quality framework, focusing on consistency, authenticity, and traceability. We design a five-layer architecture that includes prompt-driven synthetic dialogue generation, a structured variable system covering skills, institutional, and emotional dimensions, dependency and causal path modeling, graph-based structure design, and an interactive inference engine. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using a 15-segment synthetic corpus, with 41,597 tokens, 127 annotated variables, and 820 semantic relationship triples. The model exhibits strong structural consistency (Krippendorff alpha = 0.83), construct validity (RMSEA = 0.048, CFI = 0.93), and semantic alignment (mean cosine similarity > 0.78 via BERT). A key causal loop is identified: system mismatch leads to emotional frustration, reduced participation, skill gaps, and recurrence of mismatch, revealing a structural degradation cycle. This research introduces the first NIST-compliant AI modeling framework for stakeholder systems and provides a foundation for policy simulation, curriculum design, and collaborative strategy modeling."
2506.17073,"A wide range of participation is essential for democracy, as it helps prevent the dominance of extreme views, erosion of legitimacy, and political polarization. However, engagement in online political discussions often features a limited spectrum of views due to high levels of self-selection and the tendency of online platforms to facilitate exchanges primarily among like-minded individuals. This study examines whether an LLM-based bot can widen the scope of perspectives expressed by participants in online discussions through two pre-registered randomized experiments conducted in a chatroom. We evaluate the impact of a bot that actively monitors discussions, identifies missing arguments, and introduces them into the conversation. The results indicate that our bot significantly expands the range of arguments, as measured by both objective and subjective metrics. Furthermore, disclosure of the bot as AI does not significantly alter these effects. These findings suggest that LLM-based moderation tools can positively influence online political discourse."
2506.17158,"This chapter explores how online communication, particularly on social media, reshapes the reputational incentives that motivate speakers to communicate truthfully. Drawing on costly signalling theory (CST), it examines how online contexts alter the social mechanisms that sustain honest communication. Key characteristics of online spaces are identified and discussed, namely (i) the presence of novel speech acts like reposting, (ii) the gamification of communication, (iii) information overload, (iv) the presence of anonymous and unaccountable sources and (v) the increased reach and persistence of online communication. Both epistemic pitfalls and potential benefits of these features are discussed, identifying promising avenues for further empirical investigation, and underscoring CST's value for understanding and tackling online misinformation."
2506.17303,"The innovations emerging at the frontier of artificial intelligence (AI) are poised to create historic opportunities for humanity but also raise complex policy challenges. Continued progress in frontier AI carries the potential for profound advances in scientific discovery, economic productivity, and broader social well-being. As the epicenter of global AI innovation, California has a unique opportunity to continue supporting developments in frontier AI while addressing substantial risks that could have far reaching consequences for the state and beyond. This report leverages broad evidence, including empirical research, historical analysis, and modeling and simulations, to provide a framework for policymaking on the frontier of AI development. Building on this multidisciplinary approach, this report derives policy principles that can inform how California approaches the use, assessment, and governance of frontier AI: principles rooted in an ethos of trust but verify. This approach takes into account the importance of innovation while establishing appropriate strategies to reduce material risks."
2506.17311,"Academic paper review typically requires substantial time, expertise, and human resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising method for automating the review process due to their extensive training data, broad knowledge base, and relatively low usage cost. This work explores the feasibility of using LLMs for academic paper review by proposing an automated review system. The system integrates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the AutoGen multi-agent system, and Chain-of-Thought prompting to support tasks such as format checking, standardized evaluation, comment generation, and scoring. Experiments conducted on 290 submissions from the WASA 2024 conference using GPT-4o show that LLM-based review significantly reduces review time (average 2.48 hours) and cost (average \$104.28 USD). However, the similarity between LLM-selected papers and actual accepted papers remains low (average 38.6\%), indicating issues such as hallucination, lack of independent judgment, and retrieval preferences. Therefore, it is recommended to use LLMs as assistive tools to support human reviewers, rather than to replace them."
2506.17319,"In this study, we apply machine learning and software engineering in analyzing air pollution levels in City of Baltimore. The data model was fed with three primary data sources: 1) a biased method of estimating insurance risk used by homeowners loan corporation, 2) demographics of Baltimore residents, and 3) census data estimate of NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations. The dataset covers 650,643 Baltimore residents in 44.7 million residents in 202 major cities in US. The results show that air pollution levels have a clear association with the biased insurance estimating method. Great disparities present in NO2 level between more desirable and low income blocks. Similar disparities exist in air pollution level between residents' ethnicity. As Baltimore population consists of a greater proportion of people of color, the finding reveals how decades old policies has continued to discriminate and affect quality of life of Baltimore citizens today."
2506.1732,"Radiology students often struggle to develop perceptual expertise due to limited expert mentorship time, leading to errors in visual search and diagnostic interpretation. These perceptual errors, such as missed fixations, short dwell times, or misinterpretations, are not adequately addressed by current AI systems, which focus on diagnostic accuracy but fail to explain how and why errors occur. To address this gap, we introduce MAARTA (Multi-Agentic Adaptive Radiology Teaching Assistant), a multi-agent framework that analyzes gaze patterns and radiology reports to provide personalized feedback. Unlike single-agent models, MAARTA dynamically selects agents based on error complexity, enabling adaptive and efficient reasoning. By comparing expert and student gaze behavior through structured graphs, the system identifies missed findings and assigns Perceptual Error Teacher agents to analyze discrepancies. MAARTA then uses step-by-step prompting to help students understand their errors and improve diagnostic reasoning, advancing AI-driven radiology education."
2506.17339,"This article develops the concept of Autonomous Business Models (ABMs) as a distinct managerial and strategic logic in the age of agentic AI. While most firms still operate within human-driven or AI-augmented models, we argue that we are now entering a phase where agentic AI (systems capable of initiating, coordinating, and adapting actions autonomously) can increasingly execute the core mechanisms of value creation, delivery, and capture. This shift reframes AI not as a tool to support strategy, but as the strategy itself. Using two illustrative cases,this http URL, an Israeli startup pursuing autonomy by design, and a hypothetical reconfiguration of Ryanair as an AI-driven incumbent, we depict the evolution from augmented to autonomous business models. We show how ABMs reshape competitive advantage through agentic execution, continuous adaptation, and the gradual offloading of human decision-making. This transition introduces new forms of competition between AI-led firms, which we term synthetic competition, where strategic interactions occur at rapid, machine-level speed and scale. It also challenges foundational assumptions in strategy, organizational design, and governance. By positioning agentic AI as the central actor in business model execution, the article invites us to rethink strategic management in an era where firms increasingly run themselves."
2506.17347,"Over the past decade, policymakers have developed a set of regulatory tools to ensure AI development aligns with key societal goals. Many of these tools were initially developed in response to concerns with predictive AI and therefore encode certain assumptions about the nature of AI systems and the utility of certain regulatory approaches. With the advent of generative AI, however, some of these assumptions no longer hold, even as policymakers attempt to maintain a single regulatory target that covers both types of AI. In this paper, we identify four distinct aspects of generative AI that call for meaningfully different policy responses. These are the generality and adaptability of generative AI that make it a poor regulatory target, the difficulty of designing effective evaluations, new legal concerns that change the ecosystem of stakeholders and sources of expertise, and the distributed structure of the generative AI value chain. In light of these distinctions, policymakers will need to evaluate where the past decade of policy work remains relevant and where new policies, designed to address the unique risks posed by generative AI, are necessary. We outline three recommendations for policymakers to more effectively identify regulatory targets and leverage constraints across the broader ecosystem to govern generative AI."
2506.17354,"Global market-driven forces and customer needs are continuously changing. In the past, profitability and efficiency were the primary objectives of most companies. However, in recent decades, sustainable performance has emerged as a new competitive advantage. Companies have been compelled to adopt a concept that combines these evolving global interests with traditional goals resulting in the innovation of the lean and green approach.In this study, a research methodology that includes system analysis and modeling procedures to apply the lean and green concept, combined with a new evaluation metric, the Overall Environmental Equipment Effectiveness (OEEE) was used to investigate the effects of adopting lean and green practices on overall performance.A simulation model and energy value stream mapping were implemented, and the OEEE value was calculated to assess the current performance in terms of quality, availability, productivity, and sustainability. The current state production lead time was 329.1 minutes per batch, and the OEEE value was 13.1%. This result indicates existing issues in performance and sustainability, suggesting that improvement efforts should focus on enhancing these two aspects to increase the overall OEEE value.Several improvement scenarios were proposed, including combining and rearranging the inspection workstations as the first scenario, and using UV lighting for drying purposes at the framing workstation as the second. After applying these improvements, both scenarios showed increased OEEE values and reduced lead times compared to the current state. In the first scenario, the lead time decreased to 158.23 minutes, and the OEEE increased to 35%. In the second scenario, the lead time was reduced to 292 minutes, with the OEEE increasing to 24%."
2506.17355,"Introductory Computer Science classes are important for laying the foundation for advanced programming courses. However, students without prior programming experience may find these courses challenging, leading to difficulties in understanding concepts and engaging in academic dishonesty such as plagiarism. While there exists plagiarism detection techniques and tools, not all of them are suitable for academic settings, especially in introductory programming courses. This paper introduces PasteTrace, a novel open-source plagiarism detection tool designed specifically for introductory programming courses. Unlike traditional methods, PasteTrace operates within an Integrated Development Environment that tracks the student's coding activities in real-time for evidence of plagiarism. Our evaluation of PasteTrace in two introductory programming courses demonstrates the tool's ability to provide insights into student behavior and detect various forms of plagiarism, outperforming an existing well-established tool.A video demonstration of PasteTrace and its source code, and case study data are made available atthis https URL"
2506.17356,"We explore the automatic generation of interactive, scenario-based lessons designed to train novice human tutors who teach middle school mathematics online. Employing prompt engineering through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach with GPT-4o, we developed a system capable of creating structured tutor training lessons. Our study generated lessons in English for three key topics: Encouraging Students' Independence, Encouraging Help-Seeking Behavior, and Turning on Cameras, using a task decomposition prompting strategy that breaks lesson generation into sub-tasks. The generated lessons were evaluated by two human evaluators, who provided both quantitative and qualitative evaluations using a comprehensive rubric informed by lesson design research. Results demonstrate that the task decomposition strategy led to higher-rated lessons compared to single-step generation. Human evaluators identified several strengths in the LLM-generated lessons, including well-structured content and time-saving potential, while also noting limitations such as generic feedback and a lack of clarity in some instructional sections. These findings underscore the potential of hybrid human-AI approaches for generating effective lessons in tutor training."
2506.17363,"Virtual Teaching Assistants (VTAs) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance student learning by providing instant feedback and facilitating multi-turn interactions. However, empirical studies on their effectiveness and acceptance in real-world classrooms are limited, leaving their practical impact uncertain. In this study, we develop an LLM-based VTA and deploy it in an introductory AI programming course with 477 graduate students. To assess how student perceptions of the VTA's performance evolve over time, we conduct three rounds of comprehensive surveys at different stages of the course. Additionally, we analyze 3,869 student--VTA interaction pairs to identify common question types and engagement patterns. We then compare these interactions with traditional student--human instructor interactions to evaluate the VTA's role in the learning process. Through a large-scale empirical study and interaction analysis, we assess the feasibility of deploying VTAs in real-world classrooms and identify key challenges for broader adoption. Finally, we release the source code of our VTA system, fostering future advancements in AI-driven education: \texttt{this https URL}."
2506.17364,"This work investigates the use of multimodal biometrics to detect distractions caused by smartphone use during tasks that require sustained attention, with a focus on computer-based online learning. Although the methods are applicable to various domains, such as autonomous driving, we concentrate on the challenges learners face in maintaining engagement amid internal (e.g., motivation), system-related (e.g., course design) and contextual (e.g., smartphone use) factors. Traditional learning platforms often lack detailed behavioral data, but Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) and biosensors provide new insights into learner attention. We propose an AI-based approach that leverages physiological signals and head pose data to detect phone use. Our results show that single biometric signals, such as brain waves or heart rate, offer limited accuracy, while head pose alone achieves 87%. A multimodal model combining all signals reaches 91% accuracy, highlighting the benefits of integration. We conclude by discussing the implications and limitations of deploying these models for real-time support in online learning environments."
2506.1737,"As e-commerce rapidly integrates artificial intelligence for content creation and product recommendations, these technologies offer significant benefits in personalization and efficiency. AI-driven systems automate product descriptions, generate dynamic advertisements, and deliver tailored recommendations based on consumer behavior, as seen in major platforms like Amazon and Shopify. However, the widespread use of AI in e-commerce raises crucial ethical challenges, particularly around data privacy, algorithmic bias, and consumer autonomy. Bias -- whether cultural, gender-based, or socioeconomic -- can be inadvertently embedded in AI models, leading to inequitable product recommendations and reinforcing harmful stereotypes. This paper examines the ethical implications of AI-driven content creation and product recommendations, emphasizing the need for frameworks to ensure fairness, transparency, and need for more established and robust ethical standards. We propose actionable best practices to remove bias and ensure inclusivity, such as conducting regular audits of algorithms, diversifying training data, and incorporating fairness metrics into AI models. Additionally, we discuss frameworks for ethical conformance that focus on safeguarding consumer data privacy, promoting transparency in decision-making processes, and enhancing consumer autonomy. By addressing these issues, we provide guidelines for responsibly utilizing AI in e-commerce applications for content creation and product recommendations, ensuring that these technologies are both effective and ethically sound."
2506.17372,"Due to the presence of political echo chambers, it becomes imperative to detect and remove subjective bias and emotionally charged language from both the text and images of political articles. However, prior work has focused on solely the text portion of the bias rather than both the text and image portions. This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium to communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that leverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps. Image Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their bias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias score of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting biased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three steps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and the image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by comparing the bias scores. The results so far indicate that this approach is promising, with the text debiasing strategy being able to identify many potential biased words and phrases, and the ViT model showcasing effective training. The semantic alignment model also is efficient. However, more time, particularly in training, and resources are needed to obtain better results. A human evaluation portion was also proposed to ensure semantic consistency of the newly generated text and images."
2506.1751,"Scientific discovery is being revolutionized by AI and autonomous systems, yet current autonomous laboratories remain isolated islands unable to collaborate across institutions. We present the Autonomous Interconnected Science Lab Ecosystem (AISLE), a grassroots network transforming fragmented capabilities into a unified system that shorten the path from ideation to innovation to impact and accelerates discovery from decades to months. AISLE addresses five critical dimensions: (1) cross-institutional equipment orchestration, (2) intelligent data management with FAIR compliance, (3) AI-agent driven orchestration grounded in scientific principles, (4) interoperable agent communication interfaces, and (5) AI/ML-integrated scientific education. By connecting autonomous agents across institutional boundaries, autonomous science can unlock research spaces inaccessible to traditional approaches while democratizing cutting-edge technologies. This paradigm shift toward collaborative autonomous science promises breakthroughs in sustainable energy, materials development, and public health."

Findings highlight demographic divides, infrastructure gaps, and the crucial role of communication and education in AV adoption."
2506.17577,"Mastery learning improves learning proficiency and efficiency. However, the overpractice of skills--students spending time on skills they have already mastered--remains a fundamental challenge for tutoring systems. Previous research has reduced overpractice through the development of better problem selection algorithms and the authoring of focused practice tasks. However, few efforts have concentrated on reducing overpractice through step-level adaptivity, which can avoid resource-intensive curriculum redesign. We propose and evaluate Fast-Forwarding as a technique that enhances existing problem selection algorithms. Based on simulation studies informed by learner models and problem-solving pathways derived from real student data, Fast-Forwarding can reduce overpractice by up to one-third, as it does not require students to complete problem-solving steps if all remaining pathways are fully mastered. Fast-Forwarding is a flexible method that enhances any problem selection algorithm, though its effectiveness is highest for algorithms that preferentially select difficult problems. Therefore, our findings suggest that while Fast-Forwarding may improve student practice efficiency, the size of its practical impact may also depend on students' ability to stay motivated and engaged at higher levels of difficulty."
2506.17741,"Intelligent machines with superhuman capabilities have the potential to uncover problem-solving strategies beyond human discovery. Emerging evidence from competitive gameplay, such as Go and chess, demonstrates that AI systems are evolving from mere tools to sources of cultural innovation adopted by humans. However, the conditions under which intelligent machines transition from tools to drivers of persistent cultural change remain unclear. We identify three key conditions for machines to fundamentally influence human problem-solving: the discovered strategies must be non-trivial, learnable, and offer a clear advantage. Using a cultural transmission experiment and an agent-based simulation, we demonstrate that when these conditions are met, machine-discovered strategies can be transmitted, understood, and preserved by human populations, leading to enduring cultural shifts. These findings provide a framework for understanding how machines can persistently expand human cognitive skills and underscore the need to consider their broader implications for human cognition and cultural evolution."
2506.17808,"The seemingly ""imagination"" and ""creativity"" from machine-generated contents should not be misattributed to the accomplishment of machine. They are accomplishments of both human and machine. Without human interpretation, the machine-generated contents remain in the imaginary space of the large language models, and cannot automatically establish grounding in the reality and human experience."
2506.18045,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly mediate global information access for millions of users worldwide, their alignment and biases have the potential to shape public understanding and trust in fundamental democratic institutions, such as press freedom. In this study, we uncover three systematic distortions in the way six popular LLMs evaluate press freedom in 180 countries compared to expert assessments of the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI). The six LLMs exhibit a negative misalignment, consistently underestimating press freedom, with individual models rating between 71% to 93% of countries as less free. We also identify a paradoxical pattern we term differential misalignment: LLMs disproportionately underestimate press freedom in countries where it is strongest. Additionally, five of the six LLMs exhibit positive home bias, rating their home countries' press freedoms more favorably than would be expected given their negative misalignment with the human benchmark. In some cases, LLMs rate their home countries between 7% to 260% more positively than expected. If LLMs are set to become the next search engines and some of the most important cultural tools of our time, they must ensure accurate representations of the state of our human and civic rights globally."
2506.18133,"The need for developing model evaluations beyond static benchmarking, especially in the post-deployment phase, is now well-understood. At the same time, concerns about the concentration of power in deployed AI systems have sparked a keen interest in 'democratic' or 'public' AI. In this work, we bring these two ideas together by proposing mechanisms for aggregated individual reporting (AIR), a framework for post-deployment evaluation that relies on individual reports from the public. An AIR mechanism allows those who interact with a specific, deployed (AI) system to report when they feel that they may have experienced something problematic; these reports are then aggregated over time, with the goal of evaluating the relevant system in a fine-grained manner. This position paper argues that individual experiences should be understood as an integral part of post-deployment evaluation, and that the scope of our proposed aggregated individual reporting mechanism is a practical path to that end. On the one hand, individual reporting can identify substantively novel insights about safety and performance; on the other, aggregation can be uniquely useful for informing action. From a normative perspective, the post-deployment phase completes a missing piece in the conversation about 'democratic' AI. As a pathway to implementation, we provide a workflow of concrete design decisions and pointers to areas requiring further research and methodological development."

This chapter advocates a holistic approach, distinguishing preparedness, emergency responses, and postcrisis phases. The role of the Early Warning System (EWS), Risk modeling and mitigation measures are particularly emphasized. The chapter reviews the various Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabler technologies that can be leveraged at each phase, focusing on the INFORM risk framework and EWSs. Emergency communication and psychological risk perception have been emphasized in emergency response times. Finally, a set of case studies from Nordic countries has been highlighted."
2506.18932,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly being integrated into critical systems across various domains, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles. While its integration brings immense benefits, it also introduces significant risks, including those arising from AI misuse. Within the discourse on managing these risks, the terms ""AI Safety"" and ""AI Security"" are often used, sometimes interchangeably, resulting in conceptual confusion. This paper aims to demystify the distinction and delineate the precise research boundaries between AI Safety and AI Security. We provide rigorous definitions, outline their respective research focuses, and explore their interdependency, including how security breaches can precipitate safety failures and vice versa. Using clear analogies from message transmission and building construction, we illustrate these distinctions. Clarifying these boundaries is crucial for guiding precise research directions, fostering effective cross-disciplinary collaboration, enhancing policy effectiveness, and ultimately, promoting the deployment of trustworthy AI systems."
2506.18941,"Lucrative career prospects and creative opportunities often attract students to enroll in computer science majors and pursue advanced studies in the field. Consequently, there has been a significant surge in enrollment in computer science courses, resulting in large class sizes that can range from hundreds to even thousands of students. A common challenge in such large classrooms is the lack of engagement between students and both the instructor and the learning material. However, with advancements in technology and improvements in large language models (LLMs), there is a considerable opportunity to utilize LLM-based AI models, such as conversational artificial intelligence (CAI), to enhance student engagement with learning content in large classes. To explore the potential of CAI to support engagement, especially with learning content, we designed an activity in a software Engineering course (with a large class size) where students used CAI for an in-class activity. We conducted a within-subject investigation in a large classroom at a US university where we compared student engagement during an in-class activity that used CAI tool vs. one without CAI tool. The CAI tool we used was ChatGPT due to its widespread popularity and familiarity. Our results indicate that CAI (ChatGPT) has the potential to support engagement with learning content during in-class activities, especially in large class sizes. We further discuss the implications of our findings."
2506.18942,"This article demonstrates the transformative impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on actuarial science, illustrated by four implemented case studies. It begins with a historical overview of AI, tracing its evolution from early neural networks to modern GenAI technologies. The first case study shows how Large Language Models (LLMs) improve claims cost prediction by deriving significant features from unstructured textual data, significantly reducing prediction errors in the underlying machine learning task. In the second case study, we explore the automation of market comparisons using the GenAI concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation to identify and process relevant information from documents. A third case study highlights the capabilities of fine-tuned vision-enabled LLMs in classifying car damage types and extracting contextual information. The fourth case study presents a multi-agent system that autonomously analyzes data from a given dataset and generates a corresponding report detailing the key findings. In addition to these case studies, we outline further potential applications of GenAI in the insurance industry, such as the automation of claims processing and fraud detection, and the verification of document compliance with internal or external policies. Finally, we discuss challenges and considerations associated with the use of GenAI, covering regulatory issues, ethical concerns, and technical limitations, among others."
2506.18955,"This chapter addresses the citizenship challenges related to AI in education, particularly concerning students, teachers, and other educational stakeholders in the context of AI integration. We first explore how to foster AI awareness and education, along with various strategies to promote a socio-critical approach to AI training, aiming to identify relevant and ethical uses to prioritise. In the second part, we discuss critical thinking and computational thinking skills that can be mobilised within certain AI-supported educational activities, depending on the degree of creative and transformative engagement those activities require."
2506.19775,"This study uses pre-trained LLMs to conduct thematic analysis to investigate disciplinary incidents involving engineers in Quebec, shedding light on critical gaps in engineering education. Through a comprehensive review of the disciplinary register of the Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec (OIQ)'s disciplinary register for 2010 to 2024, researchers from engineering education and human resources management in technological development laboratories conducted a thematic analysis of reported incidents to identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement. The analysis aims to uncover the most common types of disciplinary incidents, underlying causes, and implications for the field in how engineering education addresses (or fails to address) these issues. Our findings identify recurring themes, analyze root causes, and offer recommendations for engineering educators and students to mitigate similar incidents. This research has implications for informing curriculum development, professional development, and performance evaluation, ultimately fostering a culture of professionalism and ethical responsibility in engineering. By providing empirical evidence of disciplinary incidents and their causes, this study contributes to evidence-based practices for engineering education and professional development, enhancing the engineering education community's understanding of professionalism and ethics."
2506.19806,"This position paper argues that large language model (LLM)-based social simulations should establish clear boundaries to meaningfully contribute to social science research. While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling human-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face fundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern discovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona'' that lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for simulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems: alignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency (maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness (reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for determining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science understanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when focusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2) agent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited variance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation robustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in determining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations."
2506.20104,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally altered the information technology (IT) risk landscape, particularly in cloud computing environments. This paper examines how this geopolitical conflict has accelerated data sovereignty concerns, transformed cybersecurity paradigms, and reshaped cloud infrastructure strategies worldwide. Through an analysis of documented cyber operations, regulatory responses, and organizational adaptations between 2022 and early 2025, this research demonstrates how the conflict has served as a catalyst for a broader reassessment of IT risk. The research reveals that while traditional IT risk frameworks offer foundational guidance, their standard application may inadequately address the nuances of state-sponsored threats, conflicting data governance regimes, and the weaponization of digital dependencies without specific geopolitical augmentation. The contribution of this paper lies in its focused synthesis and strategic adaptation of existing best practices into a multi-layered approach. This approach uniquely synergizes resilient cloud architectures (including sovereign and hybrid models), enhanced data-centric security strategies (such as advanced encryption and privacy-enhancing technologies), and geopolitically-informed governance to build digital resilience. The interplay between these layers, emphasizing how geopolitical insights directly shape architectural and security choices beyond standard best practices-particularly by integrating the human element, including personnel vulnerabilities and expertise, as a core consideration in technical design and operational management-offers a more robust defense against the specific, multifaceted risks arising from geopolitical conflict in increasingly fractured digital territories."
2506.20299,"This paper explores the pedagogical potential of ""teacher pre-prompting"" as a means of guiding student collaboration in programming education. In particular, we investigate how brief teacher-initiated questions posed before students engage in pair programming workshops can help shape problem interpretation and division of labor. Based on qualitative analysis of video data from a university course in systems development, we identify five distinct pre-prompting patterns. Our findings suggest that such prompts can foster structured discussions, clarify task requirements, and create opportunities for shared learning experiences."
2506.20433,"The potential of Generative AI (GenAI) for generating feedback in computing education has been the subject of numerous studies. However, there is still limited research on how computing students engage with this feedback and to what extent it supports their problem-solving. For this reason, we built a custom web application providing students with Python programming tasks, a code editor, GenAI feedback, and compiler feedback. Via a think-aloud protocol including eye-tracking and a post-interview with 11 undergraduate students, we investigate (1) how much attention the generated feedback received from learners and (2) to what extent the generated feedback is helpful (or not). In addition, students' attention to GenAI feedback is compared with that towards the compiler feedback. We further investigate differences between students with and without prior programming experience. The findings indicate that GenAI feedback generally receives a lot of visual attention, with inexperienced students spending twice as much fixation time. More experienced students requested GenAI less frequently, and could utilize it better to solve the given problem. It was more challenging for inexperienced students to do so, as they could not always comprehend the GenAI feedback. They often relied solely on the GenAI feedback, while compiler feedback was not read. Understanding students' attention and perception toward GenAI feedback is crucial for developing educational tools that support student learning."
2506.20442,"Biodiversity loss is a critical planetary boundary, yet its connection to computing remains largely unexamined. Prior sustainability efforts in computing have focused on carbon and water, overlooking biodiversity due to the lack of appropriate metrics and modeling frameworks. This paper presents the first end-to-end analysis of biodiversity impact from computing systems. We introduce two new metrics--Embodied Biodiversity Index (EBI) and Operational Biodiversity Index (OBI)--to quantify biodiversity impact across the lifecycle, and present FABRIC, a modeling framework that links computing workloads to biodiversity impacts. Our evaluation highlights the need to consider biodiversity alongside carbon and water in sustainable computing design and optimization. The code is available atthis https URL."
2506.2053,"As AI capabilities rapidly advance, the risk of catastrophic harm from large-scale training runs is growing. Yet the compute infrastructure that enables such development remains largely unregulated. This paper proposes a concrete framework for a global ""Compute Pause Button"": a governance system designed to prevent dangerously powerful AI systems from being trained by restricting access to computational resources. We identify three key intervention points -- technical, traceability, and regulatory -- and organize them within a Governance--Enforcement--Verification (GEV) framework to ensure rules are clear, violations are detectable, and compliance is independently verifiable. Technical mechanisms include tamper-proof FLOP caps, model locking, and offline licensing. Traceability tools track chips, components, and users across the compute supply chain. Regulatory mechanisms establish constraints through export controls, production caps, and licensing schemes. Unlike post-deployment oversight, this approach targets the material foundations of advanced AI development. Drawing from analogues ranging from nuclear non-proliferation to pandemic-era vaccine coordination, we demonstrate how compute can serve as a practical lever for global cooperation. While technical and political challenges remain, we argue that credible mechanisms already exist, and that the time to build this architecture is now, before the window for effective intervention closes."
2506.20982,"Finding balanced ways to employ Large Language Models (LLMs) in education is a challenge due to inherent risks of poor understanding of the technology and of a susceptible audience. This is particularly so with younger children, who are known to have difficulties with pervasive screen time. Working with a tangible programming robot called Cubetto, we propose an approach to benefit from the capabilities of LLMs by employing such models in the preparation of personalised storytelling, necessary for preschool children to get accustomed to the practice of commanding the robot. We engage in action research to develop an early version of a formalised process to rapidly prototype game stories for Cubetto. Our approach has both reproducible results, because it employs open weight models, and is model-agnostic, because we test it with 5 different LLMs. We document on one hand the process, the used materials and prompts, and on the other the learning experience and outcomes. We deem the generation successful for the intended purposes of using the results as a teacher aid. Testing the models on 4 different task scenarios, we encounter issues of consistency and hallucinations and document the corresponding evaluation process and attempts (some successful and some not) to overcome these issues. Importantly, the process does not expose children to LLMs directly. Rather, the technology is used to help teachers easily develop personalised narratives on children's preferred topics. We believe our method is adequate for preschool classes and we are planning to further experiment in real-world educational settings."
2506.21794,"Within the field of media framing, homelessness has been a historically under-researched topic. Framing theory states that the media's method of presenting information plays a pivotal role in controlling public sentiment toward a topic. The sentiment held towards homeless individuals influences their ability to access jobs, housing, and resources as a result of discrimination. This study analyzes the topic and sentiment trends in related media articles to validate framing theory within the scope of homelessness. It correlates these shifts in media reporting with public sentiment. We examine state-level trends in California, Florida, Washington, Oregon, and New York from 2015 to 2023. We utilize the GDELT 2.0 Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) database to gather article data and use X to measure public sentiment towards homeless individuals. Additionally, to identify if there is a correlation between media reporting and public policy, we examine the media's impact on state-level legislation. Our research uses Granger-causality tests and vector autoregressive (VAR) models to establish a correlation between media framing and public sentiment. We also use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and GPT-3.5 (LLM-as-annotator paradigm) for topic modeling and sentiment analysis. Our findings demonstrate a statistically significant correlation between media framing and public sentiment, especially in states with high homelessness rates. We found no significant correlation between media framing and legislation, suggesting a possible disconnect between public opinion and policy-making. These findings reveal the broader impact of the media's framing decisions and delineate its ability to affect society."

2506.21818,"Given the increasing demands in computer programming education and the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLMs play a critical role in programming education. This study provides a systematic review of selected empirical studies on LLMs in computer programming education, published from 2023 to March 2024. The data for this review were collected from Web of Science (SCI/SSCI), SCOPUS, and EBSCOhost databases, as well as three conference proceedings specialized in computer programming education. In total, 42 studies met the selection criteria and were reviewed using methods, including bibliometric analysis, thematic analysis, and structural topic modeling. This study offers an overview of the current state of LLMs in computer programming education research. It outlines LLMs' applications, benefits, limitations, concerns, and implications for future research and practices, establishing connections between LLMs and their practical use in computer programming education. This review also provides examples and valuable insights for instructional designers, instructors, and learners. Additionally, a conceptual framework is proposed to guide education practitioners in integrating LLMs into computer programming education. This study suggests future research directions from various perspectives, emphasizing the need to expand research methods and topics in computer programming education as LLMs evolve. Additionally, future research in the field should incorporate collaborative, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary efforts on a large scale, focusing on longitudinal research and development initiatives."
2506.21825,"The rise and growing popularity of accessible large language models have raised questions about their impact on various aspects of life, including how scientists write and publish their research. The primary objective of this paper is to analyze a dataset consisting of all abstracts posted onarXiv.orgbetween 2010 and June 7th, 2024, to assess the evolution of their readability and determine whether significant shifts occurred following the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Four standard readability formulas are used to calculate individual readability scores for each paper, classifying their level of readability. These scores are then aggregated by year and across the eight primary categories covered by the platform. The results show a steady annual decrease in readability, suggesting that abstracts are likely becoming increasingly complex. Additionally, following the release of ChatGPT, a significant change in readability is observed for 2023 and the analyzed months of 2024. Similar trends are found across categories, with most experiencing a notable change in readability during 2023 and 2024. These findings offer insights into the broader changes in readability and point to the likely influence of AI on scientific writing."
2506.21946,"Hitchhiking, a spontaneous and decentralized mode of travel, has long eluded systematic study due to its informal nature. This paper presents and analyzes the largest known structured dataset of hitchhiking rides, comprising over 63,000 entries collected over nearly two decades through platforms associated withthis http URLand lately onthis http URL. By leveraging crowd-sourced contributions, the dataset captures key spatiotemporal and strategic aspects of hitchhiking. This work documents the dataset's origins, evolution, and community-driven maintenance, highlighting its Europe-centric distribution, seasonal patterns, and reliance on a small number of highly active contributors. Through exploratory analyses, I examine waiting times, user behavior, and comment metadata, shedding light on the lived realities of hitchhikers. While the dataset has inherent biases and limitations - such as demographic skew and unverifiable entries it offers a rare and valuable window into an alternative form of mobility. I conclude by outlining future directions for enriching the dataset and advancing research on hitchhiking as both a transportation practice and cultural phenomenon."
2506.2227,"The proliferation of disinformation challenges traditional, unscalable editorial processes and existing automated systems that prioritize engagement over public service values. To address this, we introduce the Public Service Algorithm (PSA), a novel framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) for scalable, transparent content curation based on Public Service Media (PSM) inspired values. Utilizing a large multilingual news dataset from the 'A European Perspective' project, our experiment directly compared article ratings from a panel of experienced editors from various European PSMs, with those from several LLMs, focusing on four criteria: diversity, in-depth analysis, forward-looking, and cross-border relevance. Utilizing criterion-specific prompts, our results indicate a promising alignment between human editorial judgment and LLM assessments, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to automate value-driven curation at scale without sacrificing transparency. This research constitutes a first step towards a scalable framework for the automatic curation of trustworthy news content."
2506.2244,"This paper introduces the Generality-Accuracy-Simplicity (GAS) framework to analyze how large language models (LLMs) are reshaping organizations and competitive strategy. We argue that viewing AI as a simple reduction in input costs overlooks two critical dynamics: (a) the inherent trade-offs among generality, accuracy, and simplicity, and (b) the redistribution of complexity across stakeholders. While LLMs appear to defy the traditional trade-off by offering high generality and accuracy through simple interfaces, this user-facing simplicity masks a significant shift of complexity to infrastructure, compliance, and specialized personnel. The GAS trade-off, therefore, does not disappear but is relocated from the user to the organization, creating new managerial challenges, particularly around accuracy in high-stakes applications. We contend that competitive advantage no longer stems from mere AI adoption, but from mastering this redistributed complexity through the design of abstraction layers, workflow alignment, and complementary expertise. This study advances AI strategy by clarifying how scalable cognition relocates complexity and redefines the conditions for technology integration."
2506.22449,"This thesis explores the impact of the Climate Emergency movement on local government climate policy, using computational methods. The Climate Emergency movement sought to accelerate climate action at local government level through the mechanism of Climate Emergency Declarations (CEDs), resulting in a series of commitments from councils to treat climate change as an emergency. With the aim of assessing the potential of current large language models to answer complex policy questions, I first built and configured a system named PALLM (Policy Analysis with a Large Language Model), using the OpenAI model GPT-4. This system is designed to apply a conceptual framework for climate emergency response plans to a dataset of climate policy documents. I validated the performance of this system with the help of local government policymakers, by generating analyses of the climate policies of 11 local governments in Victoria and assessing the policymakers' level of agreement with PALLM's responses. Having established that PALLM's performance is satisfactory, I used it to conduct a large-scale analysis of current policy documents from local governments in the state of Victoria, Australia. This thesis presents the methodology and results of this analysis, comparing the results for councils which have passed a CED to those which did not. This study finds that GPT-4 is capable of high-level policy analysis, with limitations including a lack of reliable attribution, and can also enable more nuanced analysis by researchers. Its use in this research shows that councils which have passed a CED are more likely to have a recent and climate-specific policy, and show more attention to urgency, prioritisation, and equity and social justice, than councils which have not. It concludes that the ability to assess policy documents at scale opens up exciting new opportunities for policy researchers."
2506.22481,"In recent years, significant advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have positioned commercialized language models as wide-reaching, highly useful tools. In tandem, there has been an explosion of multidisciplinary research examining how NLP tasks reflect, perpetuate, and amplify social biases such as gender and racial bias. A significant gap in this scholarship is a detailed analysis of how queer sexualities are encoded and (mis)represented by both NLP systems and practitioners. Following previous work in the field of AI fairness, we document how sexuality is defined and operationalized via a survey and analysis of 55 articles that quantify sexuality-based NLP bias. We find that sexuality is not clearly defined in a majority of the literature surveyed, indicating a reliance on assumed or normative conceptions of sexual/romantic practices and identities. Further, we find that methods for extracting biased outputs from NLP technologies often conflate gender and sexual identities, leading to monolithic conceptions of queerness and thus improper quantifications of bias. With the goal of improving sexuality-based NLP bias analyses, we conclude with recommendations that encourage more thorough engagement with both queer communities and interdisciplinary literature."
2506.22492,"Recent advances in machine learning, particularly the emergence of foundation models, are leading to new opportunities to develop technology-based solutions to societal problems. However, the reasoning and inner workings of today's complex AI models are not transparent to the user, and there are no safety guarantees regarding their predictions. Consequently, to fulfill the promise of AI, we must address the following scientific challenge: how to develop AI-based systems that are not only accurate and performant but also safe and trustworthy?The criticality of safe operation is particularly evident for autonomous systems for control and robotics, and was the catalyst for the Safe Learning Enabled Systems (SLES) program at NSF. For the broader class of AI applications, such as users interacting with chatbots and clinicians receiving treatment recommendations, safety is, while no less important, less well-defined with context-dependent interpretations. This motivated the organization of a day-long workshop, held at University of Pennsylvania on February 26, 2025, to bring together investigators funded by the NSF SLES program with a broader pool of researchers studying AI safety. This report is the result of the discussions in the working groups that addressed different aspects of safety at the workshop. The report articulates a new research agenda focused on developing theory, methods, and tools that will provide the foundations of the next generation of AI-enabled systems."
2506.22493,"Political Compass Test (PCT) or similar questionnaires have been used to quantify LLM's political leanings. Building on a recent line of work that examines the validity of PCT tests, we demonstrate that variation in standard generation parameters does not significantly impact the models' PCT scores. However, external factors such as prompt variations and fine-tuning individually and in combination affect the same. Finally, we demonstrate that when models are fine-tuned on text datasets with higher political content than others, the PCT scores are not differentially affected. This calls for a thorough investigation into the validity of PCT and similar tests, as well as the mechanism by which political leanings are encoded in LLMs."
2506.22496,"Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic risk-taking behaviors analogous to those observed in gambling psychology, including overconfidence bias, loss-chasing tendencies, and probability misjudgment. Drawing from behavioral economics and prospect theory, we identify and formalize these ""gambling-like"" patterns where models sacrifice accuracy for high-reward outputs, exhibit escalating risk-taking after errors, and systematically miscalibrate uncertainty. We propose the Risk-Aware Response Generation (RARG) framework, incorporating insights from gambling research to address these behavioral biases through risk-calibrated training, loss-aversion mechanisms, and uncertainty-aware decision making. Our approach introduces novel evaluation paradigms based on established gambling psychology experiments, including AI adaptations of the Iowa Gambling Task and probability learning assessments. Experimental results demonstrate measurable reductions in gambling-like behaviors: 18.7\% decrease in overconfidence bias, 24.3\% reduction in loss-chasing tendencies, and improved risk calibration across diverse scenarios. This work establishes the first systematic framework for understanding and mitigating gambling psychology patterns in AI systems."
2506.22497,"This paper reconceptualises peer review as structured public commentary. Traditional academic validation is hindered by anonymity, latency, and gatekeeping. We propose a transparent, identity-linked, and reproducible system of scholarly evaluation anchored in open commentary. Leveraging blockchain for immutable audit trails and AI for iterative synthesis, we design a framework that incentivises intellectual contribution, captures epistemic evolution, and enables traceable reputational dynamics. This model empowers fields from computational science to the humanities, reframing academic knowledge as a living process rather than a static credential."
2506.22512,"AI for good initiatives often rely on the assumption that technical interventions can resolve complex social problems. In the context of human trafficking (HT), such techno-solutionism risks oversimplifying exploitation, reinforcing power imbalances and causing harm to the very communities AI claims to support. In this paper, we introduce the Radical Questioning (RQ) framework as a five step, pre-project ethical assessment tool to critically evaluate whether AI should be built at all, especially in domains involving marginalized populations and entrenched systemic injustice. RQ does not replace principles based ethics but precedes it, offering an upstream, deliberative space to confront assumptions, map power, and consider harms before design. Using a case study in AI for HT, we demonstrate how RQ reveals overlooked sociocultural complexities and guides us away from surveillance based interventions toward survivor empowerment tools. While developed in the context of HT, RQ's five step structure can generalize to other domains, though the specific questions must be contextual. This paper situates RQ within a broader AI ethics philosophy that challenges instrumentalist norms and centers relational, reflexive responsibility."
2506.22523,"Background: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) deployment in academic medical settings raises copyright compliance concerns. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute implemented GPT4DFCI, an internal generative AI tool utilizing OpenAI models, that is approved for enterprise use in research and operations. Given (1) the exceptionally broad adoption of the tool in our organization, (2) our research mission, and (3) the shared responsibility model required to benefit from Customer Copyright Commitment in Azure OpenAI Service products, we deemed rigorous copyright compliance testing necessary.Case Description: We conducted a structured red teaming exercise in Nov. 2024, with 42 participants from academic, industry, and government institutions. Four teams attempted to extract copyrighted content from GPT4DFCI across four domains: literary works, news articles, scientific publications, and access-restricted clinical notes. Teams successfully extracted verbatim book dedications and near-exact passages through various strategies. News article extraction failed despite jailbreak attempts. Scientific article reproduction yielded only high-level summaries. Clinical note testing revealed appropriate privacy safeguards.Discussion: The successful extraction of literary content indicates potential copyrighted material presence in training data, necessitating inference-time filtering. Differential success rates across content types suggest varying protective mechanisms. The event led to implementation of a copyright-specific meta-prompt in GPT4DFCI; this mitigation has been in production since Jan. 2025.Conclusion: Systematic red teaming revealed specific vulnerabilities in generative AI copyright compliance, leading to concrete mitigation strategies. Academic medical institutions deploying generative AI should implement continuous testing protocols to ensure legal and ethical compliance."

2506.23079,"The promotion of the national education digitalization strategy has facilitated the development of teaching quality evaluation towards all-round, process-oriented, precise, and intelligent directions, inspiring explorations into new methods and technologies for educational quality assurance. Classroom teaching evaluation methods dominated by teaching supervision and student teaching evaluation suffer from issues such as low efficiency, strong subjectivity, and limited evaluation dimensions. How to further advance intelligent and objective evaluation remains a topic to be explored. This paper, based on image recognition technology, speech recognition technology, and AI large language models, develops a comprehensive evaluation system that automatically generates evaluation reports and optimization suggestions from two dimensions: teacher teaching ability and classroom teaching effectiveness. This study establishes a closed-loop classroom evaluation model that comprehensively evaluates student and teaching conditions based on multi-dimensional data throughout the classroom teaching process, and further analyzes the data to guide teaching improvement. It meets the requirements of all-round and process-oriented classroom evaluation in the era of digital education, effectively solves the main problems of manual evaluation methods, and provides data collection and analysis methods as well as technologies for relevant research on educational teaching evaluation."
2506.23321,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming global industries and societies, making AI literacy an indispensable skill for future generations. While AI integration in education is still emerging in Nepal, this study focuses on assessing the current AI literacy levels and identifying learning needs among students in Chitwan District of Nepal. By measuring students' understanding of AI and pinpointing areas for improvement, this research aims to provide actionable recommendations for educational stakeholders. Given the pivotal role of young learners in navigating a rapidly evolving technological landscape, fostering AI literacy is paramount. This study seeks to understand the current state of AI literacy in Chitwan District by analyzing students' knowledge, skills, and attitudes towards AI. The results will contribute to developing robust AI education programs for Nepalese schools. This paper offers a contemporary perspective on AI's role in Nepalese secondary education, emphasizing the latest AI tools and technologies. Moreover, the study illuminates the potential revolutionary impact of technological innovations on educational leadership and student outcomes. A survey was conducted to conceptualize the newly emerging concept of AI and cybersecurity among students of Chitwan district from different schools and colleges to find the literacy rate. The participants in the survey were students between grade 9 to 12. We conclude with discussions of the affordances and barriers to bringing AI and cybersecurity education to students from lower classes."
2506.23774,"Computer-aided teacher training is a state-of-the-art method designed to enhance teachers' professional skills effectively while minimising concerns related to costs, time constraints, and geographical limitations. We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) in teacher education, using a case of teaching hate incidents management in schools. To this end, we create a multi-agent LLM-based system that mimics realistic situations of hate, using a combination of retrieval-augmented prompting and persona modelling. It is designed to identify and analyse hate speech patterns, predict potential escalation, and propose effective intervention strategies. By integrating persona modelling with agentic LLMs, we create contextually diverse simulations of hate incidents, mimicking real-life situations. The system allows teachers to analyse and understand the dynamics of hate incidents in a safe and controlled environment, providing valuable insights and practical knowledge to manage such situations confidently in real life. Our pilot evaluation demonstrates teachers' enhanced understanding of the nature of annotator disagreements and the role of context in hate speech interpretation, leading to the development of more informed and effective strategies for addressing hate in classroom settings."
2506.23851,"The integration of cloud computing in education can revolutionise learning in advanced (Australia & South Korea) and middle-income (Ghana & Nigeria) countries, while offering scalable, cost-effective and equitable access to adaptive learning systems. This paper explores how cloud computing and adaptive learning technologies are deployed across different socio-economic and infrastructure contexts. The study identifies enabling factors and systematic challenges, providing insights into how cloud-based education can be tailored to bridge the digital and educational divide globally."
2506.24061,"Human mobility in cities is shaped not only by visible structures such as highways, rivers, and parks but also by invisible barriers rooted in socioeconomic segregation, uneven access to amenities, and administrative divisions. Yet identifying and quantifying these barriers at scale and their relative importance on people's movements remains a major challenge. Neural embedding models, originally developed for language, offer a powerful way to capture the complexity of human mobility from large-scale data. Here, we apply this approach to 25.4 million observed trajectories across 11 major U.S. cities, learning mobility embeddings that reveal how people move through urban space. These mobility embeddings define a functional distance between places, one that reflects behavioral rather than physical proximity, and allow us to detect barriers between neighborhoods that are geographically close but behaviorally disconnected. We find that the strongest predictors of these barriers are differences in access to amenities, administrative borders, and residential segregation by income and race. These invisible borders are concentrated in urban cores and persist across cities, spatial scales, and time periods. Physical infrastructure, such as highways and parks, plays a secondary but still significant role, especially at short distances. We also find that individuals who cross barriers tend to do so outside of traditional commuting hours and are more likely to live in areas with greater racial diversity, and higher transit use or income. Together, these findings reveal how spatial, social, and behavioral forces structure urban accessibility and provide a scalable framework to detect and monitor barriers in cities, with applications in planning, policy evaluation, and equity analysis."
2506.24118,"This paper argues for a new paradigm for Community Notes in the LLM era: an open ecosystem where both humans and LLMs can write notes, and the decision of which notes are helpful enough to show remains in the hands of humans. This approach can accelerate the delivery of notes, while maintaining trust and legitimacy through Community Notes' foundational principle: A community of diverse human raters collectively serve as the ultimate evaluator and arbiter of what is helpful. Further, the feedback from this diverse community can be used to improve LLMs' ability to produce accurate, unbiased, broadly helpful notes--what we term Reinforcement Learning from Community Feedback (RLCF). This becomes a two-way street: LLMs serve as an asset to humans--helping deliver context quickly and with minimal effort--while human feedback, in turn, enhances the performance of LLMs. This paper describes how such a system can work, its benefits, key new risks and challenges it introduces, and a research agenda to solve those challenges and realize the potential of this approach."
2507.00007,"This paper presents a new educational framework for integrating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) platforms such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini into laboratory activities aimed at developing critical thinking and digital literacy among undergraduate students. Recognizing the limitations and risks of uncritical reliance on large language models (LLMs), the proposed pedagogical model reframes GenAI as a research subject and cognitive tool. Students formulate discipline-specific prompts and evaluate GenAI-generated responses in text, image, and video modalities. A pilot implementation in a general astronomy course for non-science majors demonstrated high levels of engagement and critical reflection, with many students continuing the activity after class and presenting results at a research symposium. The results highlight the importance of structured AI interactions in education and suggest that GenAI can improve learning outcomes when combined with reflective assessment methods. The study proposes a replicable model for interdisciplinary AI-integrated lab work, adaptable to scientific disciplines.

2507.00032,"We introduce KUL-KT, a biologically inspired architecture for knowledge tracing (KT), combining Hebbian memory encoding with gradient-based consolidation in a scalable, input-agnostic framework. KUL-KT adapts the principle of memory consolidation in neural systems, to student modeling by introducing two key innovations: (i) a time-decaying Hebbian memory update that enables graceful forgetting, and (ii) a novel Loss-aligned Internal Target (LIT) method to compute an ideal internal state, allowing continual learning without backpropagation through time. The architecture consists of a fast Hebbian memory that captures each learner interaction via a single associative update, and a slower linear network that consolidates recalled samples through gradient descent. This design enables few-shot personalization and natural forgetting without storing raw data or relying on large cohort training. Operating entirely in embedding space, KUL-KT supports both structured (tabular) and unstructured (short-answer) inputs. Empirically, KUL-KT outperforms strong baselines on ten public KT benchmarks in rank-sensitive metrics such as nDCG and Recall@10. In a classroom deployment, KUL-KT personalized quizzes from short-answer data, leading to improved learner-perceived helpfulness and reduced difficulty (p < 0.05). Ablation studies confirm that Hebbian decay and LIT are critical for continual adaptation. Compared to a strong graph-based KT model, KUL-KT trains 1.75x faster and uses 99.01\% less memory. These results position KUL-KT as a biologically grounded, memory-efficient, and input-flexible framework for personalized learning at scale."
2507.00108,"Computer programming is undergoing a true transformation driven by powerful new tools for automatic source code generation based on large language models. This transformation is also manifesting in introductory programming courses at universities around the world, generating an in-depth debate about how programming content should be taught, learned, and assessed in the context of generative artificial intelligence.This article aims, on the one hand, to review the most relevant studies on this issue, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages identified in the specialized literature. On the other hand, it proposes enriching teaching and learning methodologies by focusing on code comprehension and execution rather than on mere coding or program functionality. In particular, it advocates for the use of visual representations of code and visual simulations of its execution as effective tools for teaching, learning, and assessing programming, thus fostering a deeper understanding among students.Finally, the opinions of students who took the object-oriented programming course are presented to provide preliminary context supporting the incorporation of visual simulations in Java (or other languages) as part of the training process."
2507.00172,"Non Fungible Tokens have changed digital ownership and how creators earn money. Between 2021 and 2024, the market value exceeded 40 billion. However, the fast growth of the NFT ecosystem has revealed serious issues in managing intellectual property rights. There is a lot of confusion about the difference between owning an NFT and owning the copyright for the underlying content. This research looks at the gap between traditional copyright laws and blockchain-based transactions. We use a mixed methods approach to analyze this disconnect. We create a new IP rights matrix that clearly shows how copyright law relates to NFT ownership structures. Additionally, we include a business model taxonomy that sorts new commercial applications by their IP risk and sustainability factors. By examining important legal cases, smart contracts, and interviews with stakeholders, we find key problems in enforcing laws across different regions, standardizing licenses, and assessing business opportunities."
2507.00406,"Feedback is one of the most crucial components to facilitate effective learning. With the rise of large language models (LLMs) in recent years, research in programming education has increasingly focused on automated feedback generation to help teachers provide timely support to every student. However, prior studies often overlook key pedagogical principles, such as mastery and progress adaptation, that shape effective feedback strategies. This paper introduces a novel pedagogical framework for LLM-driven feedback generation derived from established feedback models and local insights from secondary school teachers. To evaluate this framework, we implemented a web-based application for Python programming with LLM-based feedback that follows the framework and conducted a mixed-method evaluation with eight secondary-school computer science teachers. Our findings suggest that teachers consider that, when aligned with the framework, LLMs can effectively support students and even outperform human teachers in certain scenarios through instant and precise feedback. However, we also found several limitations, such as its inability to adapt feedback to dynamic classroom contexts. Such a limitation highlights the need to complement LLM-generated feedback with human expertise to ensure effective student learning. This work demonstrates an effective way to use LLMs for feedback while adhering to pedagogical standards and highlights important considerations for future systems."
2507.00456,"This study investigates Shiksha copilot, an AI-assisted lesson planning tool deployed in government schools across Karnataka, India. The system combined LLMs and human expertise through a structured process in which English and Kannada lesson plans were co-created by curators and AI; teachers then further customized these curated plans for their classrooms using their own expertise alongside AI support. Drawing on a large-scale mixed-methods study involving 1,043 teachers and 23 curators, we examine how educators collaborate with AI to generate context-sensitive lesson plans, assess the quality of AI-generated content, and analyze shifts in teaching practices within multilingual, low-resource environments. Our findings show that teachers used Shiksha copilot both to meet administrative documentation needs and to support their teaching. The tool eased bureaucratic workload, reduced lesson planning time, and lowered teaching-related stress, while promoting a shift toward activity-based pedagogy. However, systemic challenges such as staffing shortages and administrative demands constrained broader pedagogical change. We frame these findings through the lenses of teacher-AI collaboration and communities of practice to examine the effective integration of AI tools in teaching. Finally, we propose design directions for future teacher-centered EdTech, particularly in multilingual and Global South contexts."
2507.01051,"The evolution of generative AI systems exposes the challenges of traditional legal and ethical frameworks built around consent. This chapter examines how the conventional notion of consent, while fundamental to data protection and privacy rights, proves insufficient in addressing the implications of AI-generated content derived from personal data. Through legal and ethical analysis, we show that while individuals can consent to the initial use of their data for AI training, they cannot meaningfully consent to the numerous potential outputs their data might enable or the extent to which the output is used or distributed. We identify three fundamental challenges: the scope problem, the temporality problem, and the autonomy trap, which collectively create what we term a ''consent gap'' in AI systems and their surrounding ecosystem. We argue that current legal frameworks inadequately address these emerging challenges, particularly regarding individual autonomy, identity rights, and social responsibility, especially in cases where AI-generated content creates new forms of personal representation beyond the scope of the original consent. By examining how these consent limitations intersect with broader principles of responsible AI (including fairness, transparency, accountability, and autonomy) we demonstrate the need to evolve ethical and legal approaches to consent."

2507.01062,"The exponential development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies like ChatGPT has raised increasing curiosity about their use in higher education, specifically with respect to how students view them, make use of them, and the implications for learning outcomes. This paper employs a hybrid methodological approach involving a systematic literature review and simulation-based modeling to explore student perceptions of GenAI use in the context of higher education. A total of nineteen empirical articles from 2023 through 2025 were selected from the PRISMA-based search targeting the Scopus database. Synthesis of emerging patterns from the literature was achieved by thematic categorization. Six of these had enough quantitative information, i.e., item-level means and standard deviations, to permit probabilistic modeling. One dataset, from the resulting subset, was itself selected as a representative case with which to illustrate inverse-variance weighting by Monte Carlo simulation, by virtue of its well-designed Likert scale format and thematic alignment with the use of computing systems by the researcher.The simulation provided a composite ""Success Score"" forecasting the strength of the relationship between student perceptions and learning achievements. Findings reveal that attitude factors concerned with usability and real-world usefulness are significantly better predictors of positive learning achievement than affective or trust-based factors. Such an interdisciplinary perspective provides a unique means of linking thematic results with predictive modelling, resonating with longstanding controversies about the proper use of GenAI tools within the university."
2507.01304,"Artificial intelligence (AI) offers incredible possibilities for patient care, but raises significant ethical issues, such as the potential for bias. Powerful ethical frameworks exist to minimize these issues, but are often developed for academic or regulatory environments and tend to be comprehensive but overly prescriptive, making them difficult to operationalize within fast-paced, resource-constrained environments. We introduce the Scalable Agile Framework for Execution in AI (SAFE-AI) designed to balance ethical rigor with business priorities by embedding ethical oversight into standard Agile-based product development workflows. The framework emphasizes the early establishment of testable acceptance criteria, fairness metrics, and transparency metrics to manage model uncertainty, while also promoting continuous monitoring and re-evaluation of these metrics across the AI lifecycle. A core component of this framework are responsibility metrics using scenario-based probability analogy mapping designed to enhance transparency and stakeholder trust. This ensures that retraining or tuning activities are subject to lightweight but meaningful ethical review. By focusing on the minimum necessary requirements for responsible development, our framework offers a scalable, business-aligned approach to ethical AI suitable for organizations without dedicated ethics teams."
2507.01418,"As AI integrates in various types of human writing, calls for transparency around AI assistance are growing. However, if transparency operates on uneven ground and certain identity groups bear a heavier cost for being honest, then the burden of openness becomes asymmetrical. This study investigates how AI disclosure statement affects perceptions of writing quality, and whether these effects vary by the author's race and gender. Through a large-scale controlled experiment, both human raters (n = 1,970) and LLM raters (n = 2,520) evaluated a single human-written news article while disclosure statements and author demographics were systematically varied. This approach reflects how both human and algorithmic decisions now influence access to opportunities (e.g., hiring, promotion) and social recognition (e.g., content recommendation algorithms). We find that both human and LLM raters consistently penalize disclosed AI use. However, only LLM raters exhibit demographic interaction effects: they favor articles attributed to women or Black authors when no disclosure is present. But these advantages disappear when AI assistance is revealed. These findings illuminate the complex relationships between AI disclosure and author identity, highlighting disparities between machine and human evaluation patterns."
2507.01547,"Critical infrastructure, such as transport networks, underpins economic growth by enabling mobility and trade. However, ageing assets, climate change impacts (e.g., extreme weather, rising sea levels), and hybrid threats ranging from natural disasters to cyber attacks and conflicts pose growing risks to their resilience and functionality. This review paper explores how emerging digital technologies, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI), can enhance damage assessment and monitoring of transport infrastructure. A systematic literature review examines existing AI models and datasets for assessing damage in roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure impacted by natural disasters. Special focus is given to the unique challenges and opportunities associated with bridge damage detection due to their structural complexity and critical role in connectivity. The integration of SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data with AI models is also discussed, with the review revealing a critical research gap: a scarcity of studies applying AI models to SAR data for comprehensive bridge damage assessment. Therefore, this review aims to identify the research gaps and provide foundations for AI-driven solutions for assessing and monitoring critical transport infrastructures."
2507.01787,"The Digital Services Act (DSA) introduces harmonized rules for content moderation and platform governance in the European Union, mandating robust compliance mechanisms, particularly for very large online platforms and search engines. This study examined compliance with DSA requirements, focusing on Instagram as a case study. We develop and apply a multi-level consistency framework to evaluate DSA compliance. Our findings contribute to the broader discussion on empirically-based regulation, providing insight into how researchers, regulators, auditors and platforms can better utilize DSA mechanisms to improve reporting and enforcement quality and accountability. This work underscores that consistency can help detect potential compliance failures. It also demonstrates that platforms should be evaluated as part of an interconnected ecosystem rather than through isolated processes, which is crucial for effective compliance evaluation under the DSA."
2507.02183,"Generative AI tools - most notably large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Codex - are rapidly revolutionizing computer science education. These tools can generate, debug, and explain code, thereby transforming the landscape of programming instruction. This paper examines the profound opportunities that AI offers for enhancing computer science education in general, from coding assistance to fostering innovative pedagogical practices and streamlining assessments. At the same time, it highlights challenges including academic integrity concerns, the risk of over-reliance on AI, and difficulties in verifying originality. We discuss what computer science educators should teach in the AI era, how to best integrate these technologies into curricula, and the best practices for assessing student learning in an environment where AI can generate code, prototypes and user feedback. Finally, we propose a set of policy recommendations designed to harness the potential of generative AI while preserving the integrity and rigour of computer science education. Empirical data and emerging studies are used throughout to support our arguments."
2507.02413,"Immutability is a core design goal of permissionless public blockchain systems. However, rewrites are more common than is normally understood, and the risk of rewrite, cyberattack, exploit, or black swan event is also high. Taking the position that strict immutability is neither possible on these networks nor the observed reality, this paper uses thematic analysis of node operator interviews to examine the limits of immutability in light of rewrite events. The end result is a qualitative definition of the conditional immutability found on these networks, which we call Practical Immutability. This is immutability contingent on the legitimate governance demands of the network, where network stakeholders place their trust in the governance topology of a network to lend it legitimacy, and thus manage ledger state."
2507.02648,"The AI industry is exploding in popularity, with increasing attention to potential harms and unwanted consequences. In the current digital ecosystem, AI deployments are often the product of AI supply chains (AISC): networks of outsourced models, data, and tooling through which multiple entities contribute to AI development and distribution. AI supply chains lack the modularity, redundancies, or conventional supply chain practices that enable identification, isolation, and easy correction of failures, exacerbating the already difficult processes of responding to ML-generated harms. As the stakeholders participating in and impacted by AISCs have scaled and diversified, so too have the risks they face. In this stakeholder analysis of AI supply chains, we consider who participates in AISCs, what harms they face, where sources of harm lie, and how market dynamics and power differentials inform the type and probability of remedies. Because AI supply chains are purposely invented and implemented, they may be designed to account for, rather than ignore, the complexities, consequences, and risks of deploying AI systems. To enable responsible design and management of AISCs, we offer a typology of responses to AISC-induced harms: recourse, repair, reparation or prevention. We apply this typology to stakeholders participating in a health-care AISC across three stylized markets $\unicode{x2013}$ vertical integration, horizontal integration, free market $\unicode{x2013}$ to illustrate how stakeholder positioning and power within an AISC may shape responses to an experienced harm."
2507.02913,"Many e-learning platforms assert their ability or potential to improve students' self-regulated learning (SRL), however the cyclical and undirected nature of SRL theoretical models represent significant challenges for representation within contemporary machine learning frameworks. We apply SRL-informed features to trace data in order to advance modelling of students' SRL activities, to improve predictability and explainability regarding the causal effects of learning in an eLearning environment. We demonstrate that these features improve predictive accuracy and validate the value of further research into cyclic modelling techniques for SRL."
2507.03011,"The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education requires teachers to develop AI competencies while preparing students for a society influenced by AI. This study evaluates the impact of an online teacher training program on German in-service teachers' AI literacy, usage behaviors, and attitudes toward AI. A pre-post design study was conducted with teachers (N1 = 291 for AI literacy, N2 = 436 for attitude assessment) participating in the course. The program combined synchronous and asynchronous learning formats, including webinars, self-paced modules, and practical projects. The participants exhibited notable improvements across all domains: AI literacy scores increased significantly, and all attitude items regarding AI usage and integration demonstrated significant positive changes. Teachers reported increased confidence in AI integration. Structured teacher training programs effectively enhance AI literacy and foster positive attitudes toward AI in education."
2507.03013,"Generative AI systems have rapidly advanced, with multimodal input capabilities enabling reasoning beyond text-based tasks. In education, these advancements could influence assessment design and question answering, presenting both opportunities and challenges. To investigate these effects, we introduce a high-quality dataset of 201 university-level STEM questions, manually annotated with features such as image type, role, problem complexity, and question format. Our study analyzes how these features affect generative AI performance compared to students. We evaluate four model families with five prompting strategies, comparing results to the average of 546 student responses per question. Although the best model correctly answers on average 58.5 % of the questions using majority vote aggregation, human participants consistently outperform AI on questions involving visual components. Interestingly, human performance remains stable across question features but varies by subject, whereas AI performance is susceptible to both subject matter and question features. Finally, we provide actionable insights for educators, demonstrating how question design can enhance academic integrity by leveraging features that challenge current AI systems without increasing the cognitive burden for students."
2507.0302,"This study presents a cross-national quantitative analysis of how university students in the United States and Bangladesh interact with Large Language Models (LLMs). Based on an online survey of 318 students, results show that LLMs enhance access to information, improve writing, and boost academic performance. However, concerns about overreliance, ethical risks, and critical thinking persist. Guided by the AI Literacy Framework, Expectancy-Value Theory, and Biggs' 3P Model, the study finds that motivational beliefs and technical competencies shape LLM engagement. Significant correlations were found between LLM use and perceived literacy benefits (r = .59, p < .001) and optimism (r = .41, p < .001). ANOVA results showed more frequent use among U.S. students (F = 7.92, p = .005) and STEM majors (F = 18.11, p < .001). Findings support the development of ethical, inclusive, and pedagogically sound frameworks for integrating LLMs in higher education."
2507.0305,"The UK has pursued a distinctive path in AI regulation: less cautious than the EU but more willing to address risks than the US, and has emerged as a global leader in coordinating AI safety efforts. Impressive developments from companies like London-based DeepMind began to spark concerns in the UK about catastrophic risks from around 2012, although regulatory discussion at the time focussed on bias and discrimination. By 2022, these discussions had evolved into a ""pro-innovation"" strategy, in which the government directed existing regulators to take a light-touch approach, governing AI at point of use, but avoided regulating the technology or infrastructure directly. ChatGPT arrived in late 2022, galvanising concerns that this approach may be insufficient. The UK responded by establishing an AI Safety Institute to monitor risks and hosting the first international AI Safety Summit in 2023, but - unlike the EU - refrained from regulating frontier AI development in addition to its use. A new government was elected in 2024 which promised to address this gap, but at the time of writing is yet to do so.What should the UK do next? The government faces competing objectives: harnessing AI for economic growth and better public services while mitigating risk. In light of these, we propose establishing a flexible, principles-based regulator to oversee the most advanced AI development, defensive measures against risks from AI-enabled biological design tools, and argue that more technical work is needed to understand how to respond to AI-generated misinformation. We argue for updated legal frameworks on copyright, discrimination, and AI agents, and that regulators will have a limited but important role if AI substantially disrupts labour markets.If the UK gets AI regulation right, it could demonstrate how democratic societies can harness AI's benefits while managing its risks."
2507.03059,"This article explores the feasibility of creating an ""electronic copy"" of a deceased researcher by training artificial intelligence (AI) on the data stored in their personal computers. By analyzing typical data volumes on inherited researcher computers, including textual files such as articles, emails, and drafts, it is estimated that approximately one million words are available for AI training. This volume is sufficient for fine-tuning advanced pre-trained models like GPT-4 to replicate a researcher's writing style, domain expertise, and rhetorical voice with high fidelity. The study also discusses the potential enhancements from including non-textual data and file metadata to enrich the AI's representation of the researcher. Extensions of the concept include communication between living researchers and their electronic copies, collaboration among individual electronic copies, as well as the creation and interconnection of organizational electronic copies to optimize information access and strategic decision-making. Ethical considerations such as ownership and security of these electronic copies are highlighted as critical for responsible implementation. The findings suggest promising opportunities for AI-driven preservation and augmentation of intellectual legacy."
2507.03095,"Grounded in critical realism and using narrative inquiry, this article explores this article explores the long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence within higher education. Through the analysis of student narratives collected in Iranian university settings, the study reveals that learning experiences during and after the pandemic, coupled with unprepared exposure to AI tools, have generated hidden yet impactful layers of educational inequality and cognitive disorientation."
2507.03106,"The rapid and disruptive integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in higher education is reshaping fundamental academic practices. This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact of GenAI across three core academic domains: research, teaching, and scientific dissemination. Through a systematic review of recent literature indexed in the Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEEXplore databases, the main applications, benefits, and the profound ethical and governance challenges that are emerging are identified. The analysis reveals that, although GenAI offers significant potential to boost productivity and innovation, its adoption is outpacing the development of mature institutional safeguards. The main challenges include threats to academic integrity, the risk of algorithmic bias, and the need for robust AI literacy. The study is complemented by a case study detailing the development and positioning of a prototype AI assistant for scientific writing, demonstrating a path toward the development of responsible AI tools that augment rather than replace human intellect. It concludes that the integration of GenAI is an irreversible trend. The future of academia will not be defined by resistance to this technology, but by the ability of institutions and individuals to engage with it critically, ethically, and creatively. The article calls for increased interdisciplinary research, the development of clear ethical guidelines, and a focus on critical AI pedagogy as essential skills for the 21st century."
2507.03129,"Developed nations are undergoing a profound demographic transformation, characterized by rapidly aging populations and declining birth rates. This dual trend places unprecedented strain on healthcare systems, economies, and social support structures, creating complex biological, economic, and social challenges. This paper argues that current, often siloed, policy responses, such as pronatalist initiatives that overlook the equally urgent needs of older adults, are inadequate for addressing these interconnected issues. We propose that a comprehensive, transdisciplinary framework is essential for developing sustainable and ethical solutions.Through a review of demographic drivers, policy responses, and technological advancements, we analyze the limitations of fragmented approaches and explore the potential of innovative interventions. Specifically, we examine the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics in transforming geriatric care. While these technologies offer powerful tools for personalizing treatment, enhancing diagnostics, and enabling remote monitoring, their integration presents significant challenges. These include ethical concerns regarding data privacy and compassionate care, the need for human oversight to ensure accuracy, and practical barriers related to cost, interoperability, and user acceptance.To navigate this demographic shift effectively, we conclude by advocating for a transdisciplinary framework that unites policymakers, healthcare professionals, engineers, ethicists, and community stakeholders. By co-creating solutions that ethically integrate technology and prioritize human dignity, societies can build resilient systems that promote healthy longevity and well-being for all generations."
2507.03162,"The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed various domains, particularly computer science (CS) education. These models exhibit remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks and problem-solving, raising questions about their potential and limitations in advanced CS contexts. This study presents a novel bilingual (English-Romanian) multimodal (text and image) dataset of multiple-choice questions derived from a high-level computer science competition. A particularity of our dataset is that the problems are conceived such that some of them are easier solved using reasoning on paper, while for others writing code is more efficient. We systematically evaluate State of The Art LLMs on this dataset, analyzing their performance on theoretical programming tasks. Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current LLMs, including the influence of language choice (English vs. Romanian), providing insights into their applicability in CS education and competition settings. We also address critical ethical considerations surrounding educational integrity and the fairness of assessments in the context of LLM usage. These discussions aim to inform future educational practices and policies. To support further research, our dataset will be made publicly available in both English and Romanian. Additionally, we release an educational application tailored for Romanian students, enabling them to self-assess using the dataset in an interactive and practice-oriented environment."
2507.03216,"This survey study investigates how digital humanists perceive and approach generative AI disclosure in research. The results indicate that while digital humanities scholars acknowledge the importance of disclosing GenAI use, the actual rate of disclosure in research practice remains low. Respondents differ in their views on which activities most require disclosure and on the most appropriate methods for doing so. Most also believe that safeguards for AI disclosure should be established through institutional policies rather than left to individual decisions. The study's findings will offer empirical guidance to scholars, institutional leaders, funders, and other stakeholders responsible for shaping effective disclosure policies."
2507.03457,"The emergence of deepfake technologies offers both opportunities and significant challenges. While commonly associated with deception, misinformation, and fraud, deepfakes may also enable novel applications in high-stakes contexts such as criminal investigations. However, these applications raise complex technological, ethical, and legal questions. We adopt an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on computer science, philosophy, and law, to examine what it takes to responsibly use deepfakes in criminal investigations and argue that computer-mediated communication (CMC) research, especially based on social media corpora, can provide crucial insights for understanding the potential harms and benefits of deepfakes. Our analysis outlines key research directions for the CMC community and underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration in this evolving domain."
2507.0357,"Urban streets are essential public spaces that facilitate everyday physical activity and promote health equity. Drawing on Henri Lefebvre's spatial triad, this study proposes a conceptual and methodological framework to quantify street-level exercise deprivation through the dimensions of conceived (planning and structure), perceived (visual and sensory), and lived (practice and experiential) urban spaces. We integrate multi-source spatial data-including street networks, street-view imagery, and social media-using explainable machine learning (SHAP analysis) to classify streets by their dominant deprivation modes, forming a novel typology of spatial inequity. Results highlight significant differences across urban contexts: older city cores predominantly experience infrastructural constraints (conceived space), whereas new development areas suffer from experiential disengagement (lived space). Furthermore, by identifying spatial mismatches between population distribution and exercise intensity, our study reveals localized clusters of latent deprivation. Simulation experiments demonstrate that targeted improvements across spatial dimensions can yield up to 14% increases in exercise supportiveness. This research not only operationalizes Lefebvre's spatial theory at the street scale but also provides actionable insights and intervention guidelines, contributing to the broader goals of spatial justice and urban health equity."
2507.036,"A core ethos of the Economics and Computation (EconCS) community is that people have complex private preferences and information of which the central planner is unaware, but which an appropriately designed mechanism can uncover to improve collective decisionmaking. This ethos underlies the community's largest deployed success stories, from stable matching systems to participatory budgeting. I ask: is this choice and information aggregation ``worth it''? In particular, I discuss how such systems induce \textit{heterogeneous participation}: those already relatively advantaged are, empirically, more able to pay time costs and navigate administrative burdens imposed by the mechanisms. I draw on three case studies, including my own work -- complex democratic mechanisms, resident crowdsourcing, and school matching. I end with lessons for practice and research, challenging the community to help reduce participation heterogeneity and design and deploy mechanisms that meet a ``best of both worlds'' north star: \textit{use preferences and information from those who choose to participate, but provide a ``sufficient'' quality of service to those who do not.}"
2507.03844,"In this article, we will discuss the optimization of Shanghai's recycling collection program, with the core of the task as making a decision among the choice of the alternatives. We will be showing a vivid and comprehensive application of the classical mathematical multi-criteria decision model: Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), using the eigenvector method. We will also seek the key criteria for the sustainability development of human society, by assessing the important elements of wastethis http URL, we considered the evaluation for a quantified score of the benefits and costs of recycling household glass wastes in Shanghai, respectively. In the evaluation of each score, we both adopted the AHP method to build a hierarchical structure of the problem we are facing. We first identified the key assessment criteria of the evaluation, on various perspectives including direct money costs and benefits, and further environmental and indirect considerations. Then, we distributed questionnaires to our school science teachers, taking the geometric mean, to build the pairwise comparison matrix of the criterion. After the theoretical modeling works are done, we began collecting the essential datasets for the evaluation of each score, by doing research on the official statistics, Internet information, market information and news reports. Sometimes, we proceed a logical pre-procession of the data from other data, if the data wanted isn't directly accessible. Then, we crucially considered the generalization of our mathematical model. We considered from several perspectives, including the extension of assessment criteria, and the consideration of the dynamic interdependency between the wastes, inside a limited transportation container."
2507.04166,"South Korea's City P illustrates how lofty goals of digital solidarity can falter when challenged by local governance realities. Drawing on Hansmann's ownership theory, collaborative governance concepts, and platform cooperativism, we conducted a qualitative case study involving policy documents, independent assessments, and 11 in-depth interviews with residents, officials, and technology developers. Findings reveal a marked disconnect between the initiative's stated emphasis on community co-ownership and the actual power dynamics that largely favored government agencies and external firms. Although blockchain and integrated digital tools were meant to enhance transparency and inclusivity, stakeholders--especially elderly residents--experienced confusion and mistrust. We argue that genuine collaboration in digital solidarity economies requires not only robust technical designs but also culturally resonant ownership structures, substantive inclusion of local voices, and transparent governance mechanisms. The City P case underscores the necessity of addressing heterogeneous digital capacities, aligning funding and incentives with grassroots empowerment, and mitigating performative participation to ensure meaningful and sustainable outcomes in community-based digital innovation."
2507.04249,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging raises crucial ethical concerns at every stage of its development, from data collection to deployment. Addressing these concerns is essential for ensuring that AI systems are developed and implemented in a manner that respects patient rights and promotes fairness. This study aims to explore the ethical implications of AI in medical imaging, focusing on five key stages: data collection, data processing, model training, model evaluation, and deployment. The goal is to evaluate how these stages adhere to fundamental ethical principles, including data privacy, fairness, transparency, accountability, and autonomy. An analytical approach was employed to examine the ethical challenges associated with each stage of AI development. We reviewed existing literature, guidelines, and regulations concerning AI ethics in healthcare and identified critical ethical issues at each stage. The study outlines specific inquiries and principles for each phase of AI development. The findings highlight key ethical issues: ensuring patient consent and anonymization during data collection, addressing biases in model training, ensuring transparency and fairness during model evaluation, and the importance of continuous ethical assessments during deployment. The analysis also emphasizes the impact of accessibility issues on different stakeholders, including private, public, and third-party entities. The study concludes that ethical considerations must be systematically integrated into each stage of AI development in medical imaging. By adhering to these ethical principles, AI systems can be made more robust, transparent, and aligned with patient care and data control. We propose tailored ethical inquiries and strategies to support the creation of ethically sound AI systems in medical imaging."
2507.04295,"Effective feedback is essential for student learning but is time-intensive for teachers. We present LearnLens, a modular, LLM-based system that generates personalised, curriculum-aligned feedback in science education. LearnLens comprises three components: (1) an error-aware assessment module that captures nuanced reasoning errors; (2) a curriculum-grounded generation module that uses a structured, topic-linked memory chain rather than traditional similarity-based retrieval, improving relevance and reducing noise; and (3) an educator-in-the-loop interface for customisation and oversight. LearnLens addresses key challenges in existing systems, offering scalable, high-quality feedback that empowers both teachers and students."
2507.04352,"As AI hype continues to grow, organizations face pressure to broadcast or downplay purported AI initiatives - even when contrary to truth. This paper introduces AI-washing as overstating (deceptive boasting) or understating (deceptive denial) a company's real AI usage. A 2x2 experiment (N = 401) examines how these false claims affect consumer attitudes and purchase intentions. Results reveal a pronounced asymmetry: deceptive denial evokes more negative moral judgments than honest negation, while deceptive boasting has no effects. We show that perceived betrayal mediates these outcomes. By clarifying how AI-washing erodes trust, the study highlights clear ethical implications for policymakers, marketers, and researchers striving for transparency."
2507.04424,"We introduce NourID+, a digital energy identity framework that addresses Morocco's need for trusted energy subsidy allocation through authenticated digital identity integration. NourID+ creates a strong foundation for future subsidy programs by unifying three government-issued and digitalized credentials: Moroccan national identity cards (CIN), cadastral plans, and property ownership certificates are transformed into unique digital energy IDs (DE-IDs) that map authenticated identities with specific properties and their energy consumption patterns. The system supports three property ownership profiles: farmers (landowners), entrepreneurs (factory or company owners), and households (house owners), as energy consumption is directly related to land ownership. NourID+ provides dual access through a government portal allowing officials to process DE-ID generation requests, as well as a citizen portal for DE-ID usage and energy monitoring. Our framework supports CIN upload with facial biometric matching, automated property retrieval through government APIs, and government officer approval workflow for DE-ID generation. After evaluation of the system, we demonstrate a reduction in verification time from weeks to minutes, with 98% accuracy of document validation. The proposed solution allows for targeted subsidy allocation of electricity based on actual consumption needs rather than estimations, potentially improving the efficiency of Morocco's significant energy subsidy expenditure."
2507.04641,"Disparities in the societal harms and impacts of Generative AI (GenAI) systems highlight the critical need for effective unfairness measurement approaches. While numerous benchmarks exist, designing valid measurements requires proper systematization of the unfairness construct. Yet this process is often neglected, resulting in metrics that may mischaracterize unfairness by overlooking contextual nuances, thereby compromising the validity of the resulting measurements. Building on established (un)fairness measurement frameworks for predictive AI, this paper focuses on assessing and improving the validity of the measurement task. By extending existing conceptual work in political philosophy, we propose a novel framework for evaluating GenAI unfairness measurement through the lens of the Fair Equality of Chances framework. Our framework decomposes unfairness into three core constituents: the harm/benefit resulting from the system outcomes, morally arbitrary factors that should not lead to inequality in the distribution of harm/benefit, and the morally decisive factors, which distinguish subsets that can justifiably receive different treatments. By examining fairness through this structured lens, we integrate diverse notions of (un)fairness while accounting for the contextual dynamics that shape GenAI outcomes. We analyze factors contributing to each component and the appropriate processes to systematize and measure each in turn. This work establishes a foundation for developing more valid (un)fairness measurements for GenAI systems."
2507.04996,"Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are therefore understood as systems that perceive their environment and execute pre-programmed tasks independently of external input, consistent with the SAE levels of automated driving. Yet recent research and real-world deployments have begun to showcase vehicles that exhibit behaviors outside the scope of this definition. These include natural language interaction with humans, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and the handling of unforeseen ethical dilemmas, enabled in part by multimodal large language models (LLMs). These developments highlight not only a gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capacities required for human-centered mobility, but also the emergence of a form of vehicle intelligence that currently lacks a clear designation. To address this gap, the paper introduces the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs): vehicles that integrate agentic AI systems to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. It synthesizes recent advances in agentic systems and suggests how AgVs can complement and even reshape conventional autonomy to ensure mobility services are aligned with user and societal needs. The paper concludes by outlining key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs and their potential role in shaping future agentic transportation systems."
2507.0503,"Recently, research into chatbots (also known as conversational agents, AI agents, voice assistants), which are computer applications using artificial intelligence to mimic human-like conversation, has grown sharply. Despite this growth, sociology lags other disciplines (including computer science, medicine, psychology, and communication) in publishing about chatbots. We suggest sociology can advance understanding of human-chatbot interaction and offer four sociological theories to enhance extant work in this field. The first two theories (resource substitution theory, power-dependence theory) add new insights to existing models of the drivers of chatbot use, which overlook sociological concerns about how social structure (e.g., systemic discrimination, the uneven distribution of resources within networks) inclines individuals to use chatbots, including problematic levels of emotional dependency on chatbots. The second two theories (affect control theory, fundamental cause of disease theory) help inform the development of chatbot-driven interventions that minimize safety risks and enhance equity by leveraging sociological insights into how chatbot outputs could attend to cultural contexts (e.g., affective norms) to promote wellbeing and enhance communities (e.g., opportunities for civic participation). We discuss the value of applying sociological theories for advancing theorizing about human-chatbot interaction and developing chatbots for social good."
2507.05212,"Juvenotes is a real-time AI-driven pipeline that automates the transformation of academic documents into structured exam-style question banks, optimized for low-resource medical education settings in Kenya. The system combines Azure Document Intelligence for OCR and Azure AI Foundry (OpenAI o3-mini) for question and answer generation in a microservices architecture, with a Vue/TypeScript frontend and AdonisJS backend. Mobile-first design, bandwidth-sensitive interfaces, institutional tagging, and offline features address local challenges. Piloted over seven months at Kenyan medical institutions, Juvenotes reduced content curation time from days to minutes and increased daily active users by 40%. Ninety percent of students reported improved study experiences. Key challenges included intermittent connectivity and AI-generated errors, highlighting the need for offline sync and human validation. Juvenotes shows that AI automation with contextual UX can enhance access to quality study materials in low-resource settings."
2507.05275,"Assisting medical students with clinical reasoning (CR) during clinical scenario training remains a persistent challenge in medical education. This paper presents the design and architecture of the Fuzzy Supervisor Agent (FSA), a novel component for the Multi-Agent Educational Clinical Scenario Simulation (MAECSS) platform. The FSA leverages a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to continuously interpret student interactions with specialized clinical agents (e.g., patient, physical exam, diagnostic, intervention) using pre-defined fuzzy rule bases for professionalism, medical relevance, ethical behavior, and contextual distraction. By analyzing student decision-making processes in real-time, the FSA is designed to deliver adaptive, context-aware feedback and provides assistance precisely when students encounter difficulties. This work focuses on the technical framework and rationale of the FSA, highlighting its potential to provide scalable, flexible, and human-like supervision in simulation-based medical education. Future work will include empirical evaluation and integration into broader educational settings. More detailed design and implementation is~\href{this https URL}{open sourced here}."
2507.0528,"The study assesses Hungary's National AI Strategy and its implementation through the analysis of strategic documents, publicly available financial records, and expert interviews with the Hungarian AI Coalition President and Chief Strategic Advisor to the Government Commissioner for AI. 22 goals from Hungary's strategy were evaluated through conceptual, governance, temporal, and financial dimensions before being benchmarked against Singapore's National AI Strategies (NAIS 1.0 and NAIS 2.0). Key findings include an estimated total of EUR 4.65 billion in AI-related public investment in Hungary. Openly available financial data was found for only half of the evaluated goals, and just three projects made up 98\% of all documented funding. The research also reveals Hungary's implementation challenges, including fragmented execution following ministerial reorganizations and the absence of designated biennial reviews since 2020. Furthermore, the paper provides targeted recommendations for Hungary's forthcoming AI strategy, drawing on Singapore's framework as a reference point. These include adapting to the era of large language models, restructuring the existing triple helix network to foster more effective dialogue and advocacy, and positioning the country as an East-West bridge for automotive AI experimentation."
2507.05292,"Professional development (PD) serves as the cornerstone for teacher tutors to grasp content knowledge. However, providing equitable and timely PD opportunities for teachers poses significant challenges. To address this issue, we introduce I-VIP (Intelligent Virtual Interactive Program), an intelligent tutoring platform for teacher professional development, driven by large language models (LLMs) and supported by multi-agent frameworks. This platform offers a user-friendly conversational interface and allows users to employ a variety of interactive tools to facilitate question answering, knowledge comprehension, and reflective summarization while engaging in dialogue. To underpin the functionality of this platform, including knowledge expectation analysis, response scoring and classification, and feedback generation, the multi-agent frameworks are leveraged to enhance the accuracy of judgments and mitigate the issue of missing key points."
2507.05296,"This study evaluates the implementation of a Generative AI-powered rule checking workflow within a graduate-level Building Information Modeling (BIM) course at a U.S. university. Over two semesters, 55 students participated in a classroom-based pilot exploring the use of GenAI for BIM compliance tasks, an area with limited prior research. The instructional design included lectures on prompt engineering and AI-driven rule checking, followed by an assignment where students used a large language model (LLM) to identify code violations in designs using Autodesk Revit. Surveys and interviews were conducted to assess student workload, learning effectiveness, and overall experience, using the NASA-TLX scale and regression analysis. Findings indicate students generally achieved learning objectives but faced challenges such as difficulties debugging AI-generated code and inconsistent tool performance, probably due to their limited prompt engineering experience. These issues increased cognitive and emotional strain, especially among students with minimal programming backgrounds. Despite these challenges, students expressed strong interest in future GenAI applications, particularly with clear instructional support."
2507.05305,"Frontier Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini can decipher cryptic compiler errors for novice programmers, but their computational scale, cost, and tendency to over-assist make them problematic for widespread pedagogical adoption. This work demonstrates that smaller, specialised language models, enhanced via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), present a more viable alternative for educational tools. We utilise a new dataset of 40,000 C compiler error explanations, derived from real introductory programming (CS1/2) student-generated programming errors, which we used to fine-tune three open-source models: Qwen3-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen3-32B. We performed a dual evaluation, combining expert human reviews with a large-scale automated analysis of 8,000 responses using a validated LLM-as-judge ensemble. Our results show that SFT significantly boosts the pedagogical quality of smaller models, achieving performance comparable to much larger models. We analyse the trade-offs between model size and quality, confirming that fine-tuning compact, efficient models on high-quality, domain-specific data is a potent strategy for creating specialised models to drive educational tools. We provide a replicable methodology to foster broader access to generative AI capabilities in educational contexts."
2507.0532,"Artists and especially new media artists contribute to public perceptions and adoption of new technologies through their own use of emerging media technologies such as augmented and virtual reality, generative image systems, and high-resolution displays in the production of their work. In this way, art and media production can be understood as part of the larger issue of unsustainable computational consumption. As such, it is critical for artists to develop, share, and promote new and more sustainable methods of engaging with technology, especially within the context of higher education. This paper will explore how artists might implement more sustainable methods by considering the relationship between the technical approaches of compute reuse, sustainable web development, and frugal computing, and the concepts of material specificity , futurity, and media archaeology . Proposing three methods of less carbon-intensive artistic production and a set of guidelines for introducing sustainable methods into arts and technology curriculum, this paper will outline not only the technical viability of these approaches but also the rich conceptual opportunities these approaches might offer to artists and viewers alike. For each method, models for pedagogical implementation will be explored with an emphasis on how local resources and sustainability contexts should play a role."
2507.05321,"Recent advances in AI-assisted education have encouraged the integration of vision-language models (VLMs) into academic assessment, particularly for tasks that require both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. However, existing VLM based approaches struggle with complex educational artifacts, such as programming tasks with executable components and measurable outputs, that require structured reasoning and alignment with clearly defined evaluation criteria. We introduce AGACCI, a multi-agent system that distributes specialized evaluation roles across collaborative agents to improve accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in code-oriented assessment. To evaluate the framework, we collected 360 graduate-level code-based assignments from 60 participants, each annotated by domain experts with binary rubric scores and qualitative feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that AGACCI outperforms a single GPT-based baseline in terms of rubric and feedback accuracy, relevance, consistency, and coherence, while preserving the instructional intent and evaluative depth of expert assessments. Although performance varies across task types, AGACCI highlights the potential of multi-agent systems for scalable and context-aware educational evaluation."
2507.054,"This paper introduces a novel visual mapping methodology for assessing strategic alignment in national artificial intelligence policies. The proliferation of AI strategies across countries has created an urgent need for analytical frameworks that can evaluate policy coherence between strategic objectives, foresight methods, and implementation instruments. Drawing on data from the OECD AI Policy Observatory, we analyze 15-20 national AI strategies using a combination of matrix-based visualization and network analysis to identify patterns of alignment and misalignment. Our findings reveal distinct alignment archetypes across governance models, with notable variations in how countries integrate foresight methodologies with implementation planning. High-coherence strategies demonstrate strong interconnections between economic competitiveness objectives and robust innovation funding instruments, while common vulnerabilities include misalignment between ethical AI objectives and corresponding regulatory frameworks. The proposed visual mapping approach offers both methodological contributions to policy analysis and practical insights for enhancing strategic coherence in AI governance. This research addresses significant gaps in policy evaluation methodology and provides actionable guidance for policymakers seeking to strengthen alignment in technological governance frameworks."
2507.05549,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to grow daily, more exciting (and somewhat controversial) technology emerges every other day. As we see the advancements in AI, we see more and more people becoming skeptical of it. This paper explores the complications and confusion around the ethics of generative AI art. We delve deep into the ethical side of AI, specifically generative art. We step back from the excitement and observe the impossible conundrums that this impressive technology produces. Covering environmental consequences, celebrity representation, intellectual property, deep fakes, and artist displacement. Our research found that generative AI art is responsible for increased carbon emissions, spreading misinformation, copyright infringement, unlawful depiction, and job displacement. In light of this, we propose multiple possible solutions for these problems. We address each situation's history, cause, and consequences and offer different viewpoints. At the root of it all, though, the central theme is that generative AI Art needs to be correctly legislated and regulated."
2507.05866,"As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in public and private life, understanding how citizens perceive its risks, benefits, and regulatory needs is essential. To inform ongoing regulatory efforts such as the European Union's proposed AI Act, this study models public attitudes using Bayesian networks learned from the nationally representative 2023 German survey Current Questions on AI. The survey includes variables on AI interest, exposure, perceived threats and opportunities, awareness of EU regulation, and support for legal restrictions, along with key demographic and political indicators. We estimate probabilistic models that reveal how personal engagement and techno-optimism shape public perceptions, and how political orientation and age influence regulatory attitudes. Sobol indices and conditional inference identify belief patterns and scenario-specific responses across population profiles. We show that awareness of regulation is driven by information-seeking behavior, while support for legal requirements depends strongly on perceived policy adequacy and political alignment. Our approach offers a transparent, data-driven framework for identifying which public segments are most responsive to AI policy initiatives, providing insights to inform risk communication and governance strategies. We illustrate this through a focused analysis of support for AI regulation, quantifying the influence of political ideology, perceived risks, and regulatory awareness under different scenarios."
2507.06018,"Search engines like Google have become major sources of information for voters during election campaigns. To assess potential biases across candidates' gender and partisan identities in the algorithmic curation of candidate information, we conducted a large-scale algorithm audit analyzing Google's selection and ranking of information about candidates for the 2023 Swiss Federal Elections, three and one week before the election day. Results indicate that text searches prioritize media sources in search output but less so for women politicians. Image searches revealed a tendency to reinforce stereotypes about women candidates, marked by a disproportionate focus on stereotypically pleasant emotions for women, particularly among right-leaning candidates. Crucially, we find that patterns of candidates' representation in Google text and image searches are predictive of their electoral performance."
2507.06185,"In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were found to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate AI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as ""GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY"" were concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses varied: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the practice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes this practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique of prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of hidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed evaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as ""honeypots"" to detect reviewers improperly using AI fails under examination--the consistently self-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate. Publishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer review entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure requirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond peer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including plagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need for coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized policies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation."
2507.06193,"How well do demographics explain party identification? Demographics are related to party identification in political polls, news articles, and academic publications. Yet, there is a diversity of party identification even within demographic groups which have historically been attached to one party. And some groups lack a clear connection to either party. It may be that demographics on their own fail to account for the fact that people generally belong to a variety of groups. They must select the groups which are most important to them when shaping a political identity, and may choose to construct an identity relatively unattached to any specific demographic group to which they belong. This prompts the question, do we need to consider measures of identity strength when using demographics to explain party identification? We utilize a predictive framework to address these questions and find that demographics are highly predictive for some groups (e.g., Black Democrats), while others benefit from the inclusion of identity strength (e.g., Hispanic Republicans)."
2507.06263,"According to what we call the Emotional Alignment Design Policy, artificial entities should be designed to elicit emotional reactions from users that appropriately reflect the entities' capacities and moral status, or lack thereof. This principle can be violated in two ways: by designing an artificial system that elicits stronger or weaker emotional reactions than its capacities and moral status warrant (overshooting or undershooting), or by designing a system that elicits the wrong type of emotional reaction (hitting the wrong target). Although presumably attractive, practical implementation faces several challenges including: How can we respect user autonomy while promoting appropriate responses? How should we navigate expert and public disagreement and uncertainty about facts and values? What if emotional alignment seems to require creating or destroying entities with moral status? To what extent should designs conform to versus attempt to alter user assumptions and attitudes?"
2507.06268,"Information technology is in the midst of a revolution in which omnipresent data collection and machine learning are impacting the human world as never before. The word ""intelligence"" is being used as a North Star for the development of this technology, with human cognition viewed as a baseline. This view neglects the fact that humans are social animals and that much of our intelligence is social and cultural in origin. Moreover, failing to properly situate aspects of intelligence at the social level contributes to the treatment of the societal consequences of technology as an afterthought. The path forward is not merely more data and compute, and not merely more attention paid to cognitive or symbolic representations, but a thorough blending of economic and social concepts with computational and inferential concepts at the level of algorithm design."
2507.06277,"Which factors determine AI propensity for military intervention? While the use of AI in war games and military planning is growing exponentially, the simple analysis of key drivers embedded in the models has not yet been done. This paper does a simple conjoint experiment proposing a model to decide on military intervention in 640 vignettes where each was run for 100 times allowing to explore AI decision on military intervention systematically. The analysis finds that largest predictors of AI decision to intervene are high domestic support and high probability of success. Costs such as international condemnation, military deaths, civilian deaths, and negative economic effect are statistically significant, but their effect is around half of domestic support and probability of victory. Closing window of opportunity only reaches statistical significance in interaction with other factors. The results are remarkably consistent across scenarios and across different models (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini) suggesting a pattern in AI decision-making."
2507.0631,"Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to build agents in social simulation because of their impressive abilities to generate fluent, contextually coherent dialogues. Such abilities can enhance the realism of models. However, the pursuit of realism is not necessarily compatible with the epistemic foundation of modelling. We argue that LLM agents, in many regards, are too human to model: they are too expressive, detailed and intractable to be consistent with the abstraction, simplification, and interpretability typically demanded by modelling. Through a model-building thought experiment that converts the Bass diffusion model to an LLM-based variant, we uncover five core dilemmas: a temporal resolution mismatch between natural conversation and abstract time steps; the need for intervention in conversations while avoiding undermining spontaneous agent outputs; the temptation to introduce rule-like instructions in prompts while maintaining conversational naturalness; the tension between role consistency and role evolution across time; and the challenge of understanding emergence, where system-level patterns become obscured by verbose micro textual outputs. These dilemmas steer the LLM agents towards an uncanny valley: not abstract enough to clarify underlying social mechanisms, while not natural enough to represent realistic human behaviour. This exposes an important paradox: the realism of LLM agents can obscure, rather than clarify, social dynamics when misapplied. We tease out the conditions in which LLM agents are ideally suited: where system-level emergence is not the focus, linguistic nuances and meaning are central, interactions unfold in natural time, and stable role identity is more important than long-term behavioural evolution. We call for repositioning LLM agents in the ecosystem of social simulation for future applications."
2507.06379,"Compute governance can underpin international institutions for the governance of frontier AI. To demonstrate this I explore four institutions for governing and developing frontier AI. Next steps for compute-indexed domestic frontier AI regulation could include risk assessments and pre-approvals, data centre usage reports, and release gate regulation. Domestic regimes could be harmonized and monitored through an International AI Agency - an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for AI. This could be backed up by a Secure Chips Agreement - a Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) for AI. This would be a non-proliferation regime for advanced chips, building on the chip export controls - states that do not have an IAIA-certified frontier regulation regime would not be allowed to import advanced chips. Frontier training runs could be carried out by a megaproject between the USA and its allies - a US-led Allied Public-Private Partnership for frontier AI. As a project to develop advanced AI, this could have significant advantages over alternatives led by Big Tech or particular states: it could be more legitimate, secure, safe, non-adversarial, peaceful, and less prone to misuse. For each of these four scenarios, a key incentive for participation is access to the advanced AI chips that are necessary for frontier training runs and large-scale inference. Together, they can create a situation in which governments can be reassured that frontier AI is developed and deployed in a secure manner with misuse minimised and benefits widely shared. Building these institutions may take years or decades, but progress is incremental and evolutionary and the first steps have already been taken."
2507.06434,"As frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models rapidly advance, benchmarks are integral to comparing different models and measuring their progress in different task-specific domains. However, there is a lack of guidance on when and how benchmarks should be deprecated once they cease to effectively perform their purpose. This risks benchmark scores over-valuing model capabilities, or worse, obscuring capabilities and safety-washing. Based on a review of benchmarking practices, we propose criteria to decide when to fully or partially deprecate benchmarks, and a framework for deprecating benchmarks. Our work aims to advance the state of benchmarking towards rigorous and quality evaluations, especially for frontier models, and our recommendations are aimed to benefit benchmark developers, benchmark users, AI governance actors (across governments, academia, and industry panels), and policy makers."
2507.06438,"Tools that can generate computer code in response to inputs written in natural language, such as ChatGPT, pose an existential threat to Computer Science education in its current form, since students can now use these tools to solve assignments without much effort. While that risk has already been recognized by scholars, the proportion of the student body that is incurring in this new kind of plagiarism is still an open problem. We conducted a pilot study in a large CS class (n=120) to assess the feasibility of estimating AI plagiarism through anonymous surveys and interviews. More than 25% of the survey respondents admitted to committing AI plagiarism. Conversely, only one student accepted to be interviewed. Given the high levels of misconduct acknowledgment, we conclude that surveys are an effective method for studies on the matter, while interviews should be avoided or designed in a way that can entice participation."
2507.0664,"Search engines have become the gateway to information, products, and services, including those concerning healthcare. Access to reproductive health has been especially complicated in the wake of the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, splintering abortion regulations among the states. In this study, we performed an audit of the advertisements shown to Google Search users seeking information about abortion across the United States during the year following the Dobbs decision. We found that Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs) -- organizations that target women with unexpected or ""crisis"" pregnancies, but do not provide abortions -- accounted for 47% of advertisements, whereas abortion clinics -- for 30%. Advertisements from CPCs were often returned for queries concerning information and safety. The type of advertisements returned, however, varied widely within each state, with Arizona returning the most advertisements from abortion clinics and other pro-choice organizations, and Minnesota the least. The proportion of pro-choice vs. anti-choice advertisements returned also varied over time, but estimates from Staggered Augmented Synthetic Control Methods did not indicate that changes in advertisement results were attributable to changes in state abortion laws. Our findings raise questions about the access to accurate medical information across the U.S. and point to a need for further examination of search engine advertisement policies and geographical bias."
2507.06827,"Internet has significantly improved the quality of citizens across the world. Though the internet coverage is quite high, 40% of global population do not have access to broadband internet. This paper presents an analysis of a field survey of population in some areas of Kathmandu, Nepal, an emerging economy. This survey was triggered by intermittent severe congestion of internet in certain areas of the city. People from three different areas were asked about their present experience of internet usage, its impact on their lives and their aspirations for the future. Survey pointed to high speed, low cost, reliable and secure internet as a major aspiration of the respondents. Based on their inputs, this paper presents a sentiment analysis as well as demographic information. Keys insights from this analysis shows that overall sentiment to most queries are positive. The variances of positive sentiments are high whereas those for negative ones are low. Also, some correlations and clusters are observed among the attributes though no dominant component exists in the data."
2507.06876,"Public product launches in Artificial Intelligence can serve as focusing events for collective attention, surfacing how societies react to technological change. Social media provide a window into the sensemaking around these events, surfacing hopes and fears and showing who chooses to engage in the discourse and when. We demonstrate that public sensemaking about AI is shaped by economic interests and cultural values of those involved. We analyze 3.8 million tweets posted by 1.6 million users across 117 countries in response to the public launch of ChatGPT in 2022. Our analysis shows how economic self-interest, proxied by occupational skill types in writing, programming, and mathematics, and national cultural orientations, as measured by Hofstede's individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and power distance dimensions, shape who speaks, when they speak, and their stance towards ChatGPT. Roles requiring more technical skills, such as programming and mathematics, tend to engage earlier and express more positive stances, whereas writing-centric occupations join later with greater skepticism. At the cultural level, individualism predicts both earlier engagement and a more negative stance, and uncertainty avoidance reduces the prevalence of positive stances but does not delay when users first engage with ChatGPT. Aggregate sentiment trends mask the dynamics observed in our study. The shift toward a more critical stance towards ChatGPT over time stems primarily from the entry of more skeptical voices rather than a change of heart among early adopters. Our findings underscore the importance of both the occupational background and cultural context in understanding public reactions to AI."
2507.06878,"The increasing integration of AI tools in education presents both opportunities and challenges, particularly regarding the development of the students' critical thinking skills. This position paper argues that while AI can support learning, its unchecked use may lead to cognitive atrophy, loss of agency, emotional risks, and ethical concerns, ultimately undermining the core goals of education. Drawing on cognitive science and pedagogy, the paper explores how over-reliance on AI can disrupt meaningful learning, foster dependency and conformity, undermine the students' self-efficacy, academic integrity, and well-being, and raise concerns about questionable privacy practices. It also highlights the importance of considering the students' perspectives and proposes actionable strategies to ensure that AI serves as a meaningful support rather than a cognitive shortcut. The paper advocates for an intentional, transparent, and critically informed use of AI that empowers rather than diminishes the learner."
2507.07047,"This study investigates public perceptions of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in libraries through a large-scale analysis of posts on X (formerly Twitter). Using a mixed-method approach that combines temporal trend analysis, sentiment classification, and social network analysis, this paper explores how public discourse around GenAI and libraries has evolved over time, the emotional tones that dominate the conversation, and the key users or organizations driving engagement. The findings reveal that discussions are predominantly negative in tone, with surges linked to concerns about ethics and intellectual property. Furthermore, social network analysis identifies both institutional authority and individual bridge users who facilitate cross-domain engagement. The results in this paper contribute to the growing body of literature on GenAI in the library and GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) sectors and offer a real-time, public-facing perspective on the emerging opportunities and concerns GenAI presents."
2507.07059,"This article explores how Chinese female users tactically mobilise platform features and hashtag practices to construct vernacular forms and an exclusive space of feminist resistance under algorithmic and cultural constraints. Focusing on the reappropriation of the hashtag Baby Supplementary Food (BSF), a female-dominated lifestyle app with over 300 million users, we analyse how users create a female-centered counterpublic through self-infantilisation, algorithmic play, and aesthetic withdrawal. Using the Computer-Assisted Learning and Measurement (CALM) framework, we analysed 1580 posts and propose the concept of girlhood feminism: an affective, culturally grounded form of soft resistance that refuses patriarchal life scripts without seeking direct confrontation or visibility. Rather than challenging censorship and misogyny directly, users rework platform affordances and domestic idioms to carve out emotional and symbolic spaces of dissent. Situated within the broader dynamics of East Asia's compressed modernity, this essay challenges liberal feminist paradigms grounded in confrontation and transparency. It advances a regionally grounded framework for understanding how gendered publics are navigated, negotiated, and quietly reimagined in algorithmically governed spaces."
2507.07357,"The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, has transformed how students access and engage with information, raising questions about their impact on learning outcomes and retention. This study investigates how GenAI (ChatGPT), search engines (Google), and e-textbooks influence student performance across tasks of varying cognitive complexity, based on Bloom's Taxonomy. Using a sample of 123 students, we examined performance in three tasks: [1] knowing and understanding, [2] applying, and [3] synthesizing, evaluating, and creating. Results indicate that ChatGPT and Google groups outperformed the control group in immediate assessments for lower-order cognitive tasks, benefiting from quick access to structured information. However, their advantage diminished over time, with retention test scores aligning with those of the e-textbook group. For higher-order cognitive tasks, no significant differences were observed among groups, with the control group demonstrating the highest retention. These findings suggest that while AI-driven tools facilitate immediate performance, they do not inherently reinforce long-term retention unless supported by structured learning strategies. The study highlights the need for balanced technology integration in education, ensuring that AI tools are paired with pedagogical approaches that promote deep cognitive engagement and knowledge retention."
2507.07364,"Scientific authorship norms vary dramatically across disciplines, from contribution-sensitive systems where first author is the greatest contributor and subsequent author order reflects relative input, to contribution-insensitive conventions like alphabetical ordering or senior-author-last. We develop evolutionary game-theoretic models to examine both how these divergent norms emerge and their subsequent effects on collaborative behavior. Our first model reveals that contribution-insensitive norms evolve when researchers who sacrifice positional advantage face the strongest adaptive pressure -- for example senior authors managing larger collaboration portfolios or bearing heavier reputational stakes. This ""Red King"" dynamic potentially explains why fields in which senior researchers command large labs, major grants, and extensive collaboration portfolios may paradoxically evolve conventions that favour junior-author positioning. Our second model demonstrates that established norms influence researchers' willingness to collaborate, with contribution-sensitive norms consistently outperforming insensitive alternatives in fostering successful partnerships. Contribution-insensitive norms create systematic coordination failures through two mechanisms: ""main contributor resentment"" when exceptional work goes unrecognized, and ""second contributor resentment"" when comparable efforts receive unequal credit. These findings suggest that widely adopted practices like senior-last positioning and alphabetical ordering may function as institutional frictions that impede valuable scientific collaborations rather than neutral organizational conventions, potentially reducing overall scientific productivity across affected disciplines."
2507.07517,"YouTube has rapidly emerged as a predominant platform for content consumption, effectively displacing conventional media such as television and news outlets. A part of the enormous video stream uploaded to this platform includes health-related content, both from official public health organizations, and from any individual or group that can make an account. The quality of information available on YouTube is a critical point of public health safety, especially when concerning major interventions, such as vaccination. This study differentiates itself from previous efforts of auditing YouTube videos on this topic by conducting a systematic daily collection of posted videos mentioning vaccination for the duration of 3 months. We show that the competition for the public's attention is between public health messaging by institutions and individual educators on one side, and commentators on society and politics on the other, the latest contributing the most to the videos expressing stances against vaccination. Videos opposing vaccination are more likely to mention politicians and publication media such as podcasts, reports, and news analysis, on the other hand, videos in favor are more likely to mention specific diseases or health-related topics. Finally, we find that, at the time of analysis, only 2.7% of the videos have been taken down (by the platform or the channel), despite 20.8% of the collected videos having a vaccination hesitant stance, pointing to a lack of moderation activity for hesitant content. The availability of high-quality information is essential to improve awareness and compliance with public health interventions. Our findings help characterize the public discourse around vaccination on one of the largest media platforms, disentangling the role of the different creators and their stances, and as such, they provide important insights for public health communication policy."
2507.07703,"Does AI conform to humans, or will we conform to AI? An ethical evaluation of AI-intensive companies will allow investors to knowledgeably participate in the decision. The evaluation is built from nine performance indicators that can be analyzed and scored to reflect a technology's human-centering. The result is objective investment guidance, as well as investors empowered to act in accordance with their own values. Incorporating ethics into financial decisions is a strategy that will be recognized by participants in environmental, social, and governance investing, however, this paper argues that conventional ESG frameworks are inadequate to companies that function with AI at their core. Fully accounting for contemporary big data, predictive analytics, and machine learning requires specialized metrics customized from established AI ethics principles. With these metrics established, the larger goal is a model for humanist investing in AI-intensive companies that is intellectually robust, manageable for analysts, useful for portfolio managers, and credible for investors."
2507.07765,"Advances in low-communication training algorithms are enabling a shift from centralised model training to compute setups that are either distributed across multiple clusters or decentralised via community-driven contributions. This paper distinguishes these two scenarios - distributed and decentralised training - which are little understood and often conflated in policy discourse. We discuss how they could impact technical AI governance through an increased risk of compute structuring, capability proliferation, and the erosion of detectability and shutdownability. While these trends foreshadow a possible new paradigm that could challenge key assumptions of compute governance, we emphasise that certain policy levers, like export controls, remain relevant. We also acknowledge potential benefits of decentralised AI, including privacy-preserving training runs that could unlock access to more data, and mitigating harmful power concentration. Our goal is to support more precise policymaking around compute, capability proliferation, and decentralised AI development."
2507.07767,"Prior research shows that how students engage with Large Language Models (LLMs) influences their problem-solving and understanding, reinforcing the need to support productive LLM-uses that promote learning. This study evaluates the impact of a structured GPT platform designed to promote 'good' prompting behavior with data from 58 students in a graduate-level robotics course. The students were assigned to either an intervention group using the structured platform or a control group using ChatGPT freely for two practice lab sessions, before a third session where all students could freely use ChatGPT. We analyzed student perception (pre-post surveys), prompting behavior (logs), performance (task scores), and learning (pre-post tests). Although we found no differences in performance or learning between groups, we identified prompting behaviors - such as having clear prompts focused on understanding code - that were linked with higher learning gains and were more prominent when students used the structured platform. However, such behaviors did not transfer once students were no longer constrained to use the structured platform. Qualitative survey data showed mixed perceptions: some students perceived the value of the structured platform, but most did not perceive its relevance and resisted changing their habits. These findings contribute to ongoing efforts to identify effective strategies for integrating LLMs into learning and question the effectiveness of bottom-up approaches that temporarily alter user interfaces to influence students' interaction. Future research could instead explore top-down strategies that address students' motivations and explicitly demonstrate how certain interaction patterns support learning."
2507.07881,"The rise of conversational AI (CAI), powered by large language models, is transforming how individuals access and interact with digital information. However, these tools may inadvertently amplify existing digital inequalities. This study investigates whether differences in formal education are associated with CAI avoidance, leveraging behavioral data from an online experiment (N = 1,636). Participants were randomly assigned to a control or an information-seeking task, either a traditional online search or a CAI (Perplexity AI). Task avoidance (operationalized as survey abandonment or providing unrelated responses during task assignment) was significantly higher in the CAI group (51%) compared to the search (30.9%) and control (16.8%) groups, with the highest CAI avoidance among participants with lower education levels (~74.4%). Structural equation modeling based on the theoretical framework UTAUT2 and LASSO regressions reveal that education is strongly associated with CAI avoidance, even after accounting for various cognitive and affective predictors of technology adoption. These findings underscore education's central role in shaping AI adoption and the role of self-selection biases in AI-related research, stressing the need for inclusive design to ensure equitable access to emerging technologies."
2507.08103,"Agriculture contributes trillions of dollars to the US economy each year. Digital technologies are disruptive forces in agriculture. The open source movement is beginning to emerge in agriculture technology and has dramatic implications for the future of farming and agriculture digital technologies. The convergence of open source and agriculture digital technology is observable in scientific research, but the implications of open source ideals related to agriculture technology have yet to be explored. This study explores open agriculture digital technology through a systematic mapping of available open agriculture digital technology research. The study contributes to Information Systems research by illuminating current trends and future research opportunities."
2507.0811,"Today, social media platforms are significant sources of news and political communication, but their role in spreading misinformation has raised significant concerns. In response, these platforms have implemented various content moderation strategies. One such method, Community Notes (formerly Birdwatch) on X (formerly Twitter), relies on crowdsourced fact-checking and has gained traction. However, it faces challenges such as partisan bias and delays in verification. This study explores an AI-assisted hybrid moderation framework in which participants receive AI-generated feedback, supportive, neutral, or argumentative, on their notes and are asked to revise them accordingly. The results show that incorporating feedback improves the quality of notes, with the most substantial gains resulting from argumentative feedback. This underscores the value of diverse perspectives and direct engagement in human-AI collective intelligence. The research contributes to ongoing discussions about AI's role in political content moderation, highlighting the potential of generative AI and the importance of informed design."
2507.08211,"Large language model (LLM) chatbots show increasing promise in persuasive communication. Yet their real-world utility remains uncertain, particularly in clinical settings where sustained conversations are difficult to scale. In a pre-registered randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 915 U.S. adults (ages 45-75) who had never completed colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Participants were randomized to: (1) no message control, (2) expert-written patient materials, (3) single AI-generated message, or (4) a motivational interviewing chatbot. All participants were required to remain in their assigned condition for at least three minutes. Both AI arms tailored content using participant's self-reported demographics including age and gender. Both AI interventions significantly increased stool test intentions by over 12 points (12.9-13.8/100), compared to a 7.5 gain for expert materials (p<.001 for all comparisons). While the AI arms outperformed the no message control for colonoscopy intent, neither showed improvement xover expert materials. Notably, for both outcomes, the chatbot did not outperform the single AI message in boosting intent despite participants spending ~3.5 minutes more on average engaging with it. These findings suggest concise, demographically tailored AI messages may offer a more scalable and clinically viable path to health behavior change than more complex conversational agents and generic time intensive expert-written materials. Moreover, LLMs appear more persuasive for lesser-known and less-invasive screening approaches like stool testing, but may be less effective for entrenched preferences like colonoscopy. Future work should examine which facets of personalization drive behavior change, whether integrating structural supports can translate these modest intent gains into completed screenings, and which health behaviors are most responsive to AI-supported guidance."
2507.0831,"This paper examines the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on scientific practices, conducting a qualitative review of selected literature to explore its applications, benefits, and challenges. The review draws on the OpenAlex publication database, using a Boolean search approach to identify scientific literature related to GenAI (including large language models and ChatGPT). Thirty-nine highly cited papers and commentaries are reviewed and qualitatively coded. Results are categorized by GenAI applications in science, scientific writing, medical practice, and education and training. The analysis finds that while there is a rapid adoption of GenAI in science and science practice, its long-term implications remain unclear, with ongoing uncertainties about its use and governance. The study provides early insights into GenAI's growing role in science and identifies questions for future research in this evolving field."
2507.08869,"Construction zones are inherently hazardous, posing significant risks to construction workers and motorists. Despite existing safety measures, construction zones continue to witness fatalities and serious injuries, imposing economic burdens. Addressing these issues requires understanding root causes and implementing preventive strategies centered around the 4Es (Engineering, Education, Enforcement, Emergency Response) and 4Is (Information Intelligence, Innovation, Insight into communities, Investment, and Policies). Proper safety management, integrating these strategic initiatives, aims to reduce and potentially eliminate fatalities and serious injuries in work zones. In Florida, road construction work zone fatalities and serious injuries remain a critical concern, especially in urban counties. Despite a 12 billion dollars infrastructure investment in 2022, Florida ranks eighth nationally for fatal work zone crashes involving commercial motor vehicles (CMVs). Analysis from 2019 to 2023 shows an average of 71 fatalities and 309 serious injuries annually in Florida work zones, reflecting a persistent safety challenge. High-risk counties include Orange, Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, Pasco, Miami-Dade, Seminole, Manatee, Palm Beach, and Lake. This study presents a preliminary analysis of work zone crashes in Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, and Orange counties. A multilogit model assessed attributes contributing to fatalities and serious injuries, such as crash type, weather and light conditions, work zone type, type of shoulder, presence of workers, and law enforcement. Results indicate significant contributing factors, highlighting opportunities to use machine learning for alerting drivers and construction managers, ultimately enhancing safety protocols and reducing fatalities."
2507.08879,"The growing availability and use of deepfake technologies increases risks for democratic societies, e.g., for political communication on online platforms. The EU has responded with transparency obligations for providers and deployers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and online platforms. This includes marking deepfakes during generation and labeling deepfakes when they are shared. However, the lack of industry and enforcement standards poses an ongoing challenge. Through a multivocal literature review, we summarize methods for marking, detecting, and labeling deepfakes and assess their effectiveness under EU regulation. Our results indicate that individual methods fail to meet regulatory and practical requirements. Therefore, we propose a multi-level strategy combining the strengths of existing methods. To account for the masses of content on online platforms, our multi-level strategy provides scalability and practicality via a simple scoring mechanism. At the same time, it is agnostic to types of deepfake technology and allows for context-specific risk weighting."
2507.08881,"The integration of large language model (LLM) technology into judicial systems is fundamentally transforming legal practice worldwide. However, this global transformation has revealed an urgent paradox requiring immediate attention. This study introduces the concept of ``consistency-acceptability divergence'' for the first time, referring to the gap between technical consistency and social acceptance. While LLMs achieve high consistency at the technical level, this consistency demonstrates both positive and negative effects. Through comprehensive analysis of recent data on LLM judicial applications from 2023--2025, this study finds that addressing this challenge requires understanding both task and stakeholder dimensions. This study proposes the Dual-Track Deliberative Multi-Role LLM Judicial Governance Framework (DTDMR-LJGF), which enables intelligent task classification and meaningful interaction among diverse stakeholders. This framework offers both theoretical insights and practical guidance for building an LLM judicial ecosystem that balances technical efficiency with social legitimacy."
2507.08908,"Despite the widespread interest in machine learning (ML), the engineering industry has not yet fully adopted ML-based methods, which has left engineers and stakeholders uncertain about the legal and regulatory frameworks that govern their decisions. This gap remains unaddressed as an engineer's decision-making process, typically governed by professional ethics and practical guidelines, now intersects with complex algorithmic outputs. To bridge this gap, this paper explores how engineers can navigate legal principles and legislative justifications that support and/or contest the deployment of ML technologies. Drawing on recent precedents and experiences gained from other fields, this paper argues that analogical reasoning can provide a basis for embedding ML within existing engineering codes while maintaining professional accountability and meeting safety requirements. In exploring these issues, the discussion focuses on established liability doctrines, such as negligence and product liability, and highlights how courts have evaluated the use of predictive models. We further analyze how legislative bodies and standard-setting organizations can furnish explicit guidance equivalent to prior endorsements of emergent technologies. This exploration stresses the vitality of understanding the interplay between technical justifications and legal precedents for shaping an informed stance on ML's legitimacy in engineering practice. Finally, our analysis catalyzes a legal framework for integrating ML through which stakeholders can critically assess the responsibilities, liabilities, and benefits inherent in ML-driven engineering solutions."
2507.0902,"This paper explores how AI-powered tools could be leveraged to streamline the process of identifying, screening, and analyzing relevant literature in academic research. More specifically, we examine the documented relationship between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors and the cost of capital (CoC). By applying an AI-assisted workflow, we identified 36 published studies, synthesized their key findings, and highlighted relevant theories, moderators, and methodological challenges. Our analyses demonstrate the value of AI tools in enhancing business research processes and also contribute to the growing literature on the importance of ESG in the field of corporate finance."
2507.0906,"Datasets play a central role in AI governance by enabling both evaluation (measuring capabilities) and alignment (enforcing values) along axes such as helpfulness, harmlessness, toxicity, quality, and more. However, most alignment and evaluation datasets depend on researcher-defined or developer-defined axes curated from non-representative samples. As a result, developers typically benchmark models against broad (often Western-centric) values that overlook the varied contexts of their real-world deployment. Consequently, models trained on such proxies can fail to meet the needs and expectations of diverse user communities within these deployment contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce CALMA (Context-aligned Axes for Language Model Alignment), a grounded, participatory methodology for eliciting context-relevant axes for evaluation and alignment. In a pilot with two distinct communities, CALMA surfaced novel priorities that are absent from standard benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate the value of evaluation practices based on open-ended and use-case-driven processes. Our work advances the development of pluralistic, transparent, and context-sensitive alignment pipelines."
2507.09233,"AI-driven recruitment systems, while promising efficiency and objectivity, often perpetuate systemic inequalities by encoding cultural and social capital disparities into algorithmic decision making. This article develops and defends a novel theory of secondary bounded rationality, arguing that AI systems, despite their computational power, inherit and amplify human cognitive and structural biases through technical and sociopolitical constraints. Analyzing multimodal recruitment frameworks, we demonstrate how algorithmic processes transform historical inequalities, such as elite credential privileging and network homophily, into ostensibly meritocratic outcomes. Using Bourdieusian capital theory and Simon's bounded rationality, we reveal a recursive cycle where AI entrenches exclusion by optimizing for legible yet biased proxies of competence. We propose mitigation strategies, including counterfactual fairness testing, capital-aware auditing, and regulatory interventions, to disrupt this self-reinforcing inequality."
2507.09239,"The societal role of technology, including artificial intelligence (AI), is often shaped by sociocultural narratives. This study examines how U.S. news media construct narratives about the efficacy of generative AI (GenAI), using ChatGPT in higher education as a case study. Grounded in Agenda Setting Theory, we analyzed 198 articles published between November 2022 and October 2024, employing LDA topic modeling and sentiment analysis. Our findings identify six key topics in the media discourse, with sentiment analysis revealing generally positive portrayals of ChatGPT's integration into higher education through policy, curriculum, teaching practices, collaborative decision-making, skill development, and human-centered learning. In contrast, media narratives express more negative sentiment regarding their impact on entry-level jobs and college admissions. This research highlights how media coverage can influence public perceptions of GenAI in education and provides actionable insights for policymakers, educators, and AI developers navigating its adoption and representation in public discourse."
2507.09296,"Open source projects have made incredible progress in producing transparent and widely usable machine learning models and systems, but open source alone will face challenges in fully democratizing access to AI. Unlike software, AI models require substantial resources for activation -- compute, post-training, deployment, and oversight -- which only a few actors can currently provide. This paper argues that open source AI must be complemented by public AI: infrastructure and institutions that ensure models are accessible, sustainable, and governed in the public interest. To achieve the full promise of AI models as prosocial public goods, we need to build public infrastructure to power and deliver open source software and models."
2507.09676,"A key assumption fuelling optimism about the progress of large language models (LLMs) in accurately and comprehensively modelling the world is that the truth is systematic: true statements about the world form a whole that is not just consistent, in that it contains no contradictions, but coherent, in that the truths are inferentially interlinked. This holds out the prospect that LLMs might in principle rely on that systematicity to fill in gaps and correct inaccuracies in the training data: consistency and coherence promise to facilitate progress towards comprehensiveness in an LLM's representation of the world. However, philosophers have identified compelling reasons to doubt that the truth is systematic across all domains of thought, arguing that in normative domains, in particular, the truth is largely asystematic. I argue that insofar as the truth in normative domains is asystematic, this renders it correspondingly harder for LLMs to make progress, because they cannot then leverage the systematicity of truth. And the less LLMs can rely on the systematicity of truth, the less we can rely on them to do our practical deliberation for us, because the very asystematicity of normative domains requires human agency to play a greater role in practical thought."
2507.10559,"Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have been accompanied by rapidly growing public interest in natural language processing (NLP). This attention is reflected by major news venues, which sometimes invite NLP researchers to share their knowledge and views with a wide audience. Recognizing the opportunities of the present, for both the research field and for individual researchers, this paper shares recommendations for communicating with a general audience about the capabilities and limitations of NLP. These recommendations cover three themes: vague terminology as an obstacle to public understanding, unreasonable expectations as obstacles to sustainable growth, and ethical failures as obstacles to continued support. Published NLP research and popular news coverage are cited to illustrate these themes with examples. The recommendations promote effective, transparent communication with the general public about NLP, in order to strengthen public understanding and encourage support for research."
2507.10576,"The legal field already uses various large language models (LLMs) in actual applications, but their quantitative performance and reasons for it are underexplored. We evaluated several open-source and proprietary LLMs -- including GPT-series, Anthropic, Deepseek and Llama-3, variants -- on parts of the European Qualifying Examination (EQE) for future European Patent Attorneys. OpenAI o1 led with 0.82 accuracy and 0.81 F1 score, whereas (Amazon Web Services) AWS Llama 3.1 8B lagged at 0.50 accuracy, and a Python-deployed Llama 3.1 8B scored 0.55. The latter two are within the range of mere guessing for the two-answer forced-choice design. None of the evaluated models could have passed the examination fully, as accuracy never exceeded the average threshold of 0.90 required for professional-level standards -- also not models that are regularly promoted for their assumed beyond-PhD- and bar-admitted-lawyer-level performance. GPT-4o excelled at integrating text and graphics, while Claude 3 Opus often lost formatting coherence. Human patent experts evaluated the textual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings of each model. They valued clarity and legal rationale over the raw correctness of the answers, which revealed misalignment between automatic metrics and expert judgment. Model outputs were sensitive to modest temperature changes and prompt wording, which underscores the remaining necessity of expert oversight. Future work should target logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive prompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. In summary, despite the outstanding performance of recent large models, the general public might overestimate their performance. The field has a long way to go to develop a virtual patent attorney. This paper wants to point out several specific limitations that need solutions."
2507.10579,"This shared task has aimed to assess pedagogical abilities of AI tutors powered by large language models (LLMs), focusing on evaluating the quality of tutor responses aimed at student's mistake remediation within educational dialogues. The task consisted of five tracks designed to automatically evaluate the AI tutor's performance across key dimensions of mistake identification, precise location of the mistake, providing guidance, and feedback actionability, grounded in learning science principles that define good and effective tutor responses, as well as the track focusing on detection of the tutor identity. The task attracted over 50 international teams across all tracks. The submitted models were evaluated against gold-standard human annotations, and the results, while promising, show that there is still significant room for improvement in this domain: the best results for the four pedagogical ability assessment tracks range between macro F1 scores of 58.34 (for providing guidance) and 71.81 (for mistake identification) on three-class problems, with the best F1 score in the tutor identification track reaching 96.98 on a 9-class task. In this paper, we overview the main findings of the shared task, discuss the approaches taken by the teams, and analyze their performance. All resources associated with this task are made publicly available to support future research in this critical domain."
2507.10695,"Individuals are increasingly relying on large language model (LLM)-enabled conversational agents for emotional support. While prior research has examined privacy and security issues in chatbots specifically designed for mental health purposes, these chatbots are overwhelmingly ""rule-based"" offerings that do not leverage generative AI. Little empirical research currently measures users' privacy and security concerns, attitudes, and expectations when using general-purpose LLM-enabled chatbots to manage and improve mental health. Through 21 semi-structured interviews with U.S. participants, we identified critical misconceptions and a general lack of risk awareness. Participants conflated the human-like empathy exhibited by LLMs with human-like accountability and mistakenly believed that their interactions with these chatbots were safeguarded by the same regulations (e.g., HIPAA) as disclosures with a licensed therapist. We introduce the concept of ""intangible vulnerability,"" where emotional or psychological disclosures are undervalued compared to more tangible forms of information (e.g., financial or location-based data). To address this, we propose recommendations to safeguard user mental health disclosures with general-purpose LLM-enabled chatbots more effectively."
2507.10786,"Equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced sensing capabilities, social robots are gaining interest among consumers in the United States. These robots seem like a natural evolution of traditional smart home devices. However, their extensive data collection capabilities, anthropomorphic features, and capacity to interact with their environment make social robots a more significant security and privacy threat. Increased risks include data linkage, unauthorized data sharing, and the physical safety of users and their homes. It is critical to investigate U.S. users' security and privacy needs and concerns to guide the design of social robots while these devices are still in the early stages of commercialization in the U.S. market. Through 19 semi-structured interviews, we identified significant security and privacy concerns, highlighting the need for transparency, usability, and robust privacy controls to support adoption. For educational applications, participants worried most about misinformation, and in medical use cases, they worried about the reliability of these devices. Participants were also concerned with the data inference that social robots could enable. We found that participants expect tangible privacy controls, indicators of data collection, and context-appropriate functionality."
2507.10891,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping journalistic practices across the globe, offering new opportunities while raising ethical, professional, and societal concerns. This study presents a comprehensive systematic review of published articles on AI in journalism from 2010 to 2025. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, a total of 72 peer-reviewed articles were selected from Scopus and Web of Science databases. The analysis combines bibliometric mapping and qualitative thematic synthesis to identify dominant trends, technologies, geographical distributions, and ethical debates. Additionally, sentiment analysis was performed on article abstracts using the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) algorithm to capture evaluative tones across the literature. The findings show a sharp increase in research activity after 2020, with prominent focus areas including automation, misinformation, and ethical governance. While most studies reflect cautious optimism, concerns over bias, transparency, and accountability remain persistent. The review also highlights regional disparities in scholarly contributions, with limited representation from the Global South. By integrating quantitative and qualitative insights, this study offers a multi-dimensional understanding of how AI is transforming journalism and proposes future research directions for inclusive and responsible innovation."
2507.11403,"The rapid rise of AI is poised to disrupt the labor market. However, AI is not a monolith; its impact depends on both the nature of the innovation and the jobs it affects. While computational approaches are emerging, there is no consensus on how to systematically measure an innovation's disruptive potential. Here, we calculate the disruption index of 3,237 U.S. AI patents (2015-2022) and link them to job tasks to distinguish between ""consolidating"" AI innovations that reinforce existing structures and ""disruptive"" AI innovations that alter them. Our analysis reveals that consolidating AI primarily targets physical, routine, and solo tasks, common in manufacturing and construction in the Midwest and central states. By contrast, disruptive AI affects unpredictable and mental tasks, particularly in coastal science and technology sectors. Surprisingly, we also find that disruptive AI disproportionately affects areas already facing skilled labor shortages, suggesting disruptive AI technologies may accelerate change where workers are scarce rather than replacing a surplus. Ultimately, consolidating AI appears to extend current automation trends, while disruptive AI is set to transform complex mental work, with a notable exception for collaborative tasks."
2507.11477,"Online conversations are often interrupted by trolling, which causes emotional distress and conflict among users. Previous research has focused on moderating harmful content after it has been posted, but ways to manage emotions in real-time remain unexplored. This study suggests a comment queuing mechanism that delays comment publishing, encourages self-reflection, and reduces the impact of impulsive and toxic comments. To assess the efficacy of this approach, a mixed-method research design is used. An analysis of 15,000 user interactions on Reddit showed that this approach could reduce the spread of hate speech and anger by up to 15%, with only 4% of comments being delayed for about 47 seconds on average. We also surveyed users for feedback on the mechanism. The results showed that 93. 3\% of the participants thought that the queuing mechanism could help calm the discussions and showed interest in seeing it used on social media platforms. Furthermore, 83% believed it would reduce impulsive comments and balance the emotional tone in conversations. We found a strong link between users' typical emotional states while using social media and their perceptions of the delay, with calm users finding the mechanism helpful and frustrated users anticipating frustration."
2507.11543,"This paper surveys the use of Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Claude, in computer science education, focusing on key aspects of accuracy, authenticity, and assessment. Through a literature review, we highlight both the challenges and opportunities these AI tools present. While Generative AI improves efficiency and supports creative student work, it raises concerns such as AI hallucinations, error propagation, bias, and blurred lines between AI-assisted and student-authored content. Human oversight is crucial for addressing these concerns. Existing literature recommends adopting hybrid assessment models that combine AI with human evaluation, developing bias detection frameworks, and promoting AI literacy for both students and educators. Our findings suggest that the successful integration of AI requires a balanced approach, considering ethical, pedagogical, and technical factors. Future research may explore enhancing AI accuracy, preserving academic integrity, and developing adaptive models that balance creativity with precision."
2507.11544,"Open-weight large language models (LLMs) unlock huge benefits in innovation, personalization, privacy, and democratization. However, their core advantage - modifiability - opens the door to systemic risks: bad actors can trivially subvert current safeguards, turning beneficial models into tools for harm. This leads to a 'safety gap': the difference in dangerous capabilities between a model with intact safeguards and one that has been stripped of those safeguards. We open-source a toolkit to estimate the safety gap for state-of-the-art open-weight models. As a case study, we evaluate biochemical and cyber capabilities, refusal rates, and generation quality of models from two families (Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5) across a range of parameter scales (0.5B to 405B) using different safeguard removal techniques. Our experiments reveal that the safety gap widens as model scale increases and effective dangerous capabilities grow substantially when safeguards are removed. We hope that the Safety Gap Toolkit (this https URL) will serve as an evaluation framework for common open-source models and as a motivation for developing and testing tamper-resistant safeguards. We welcome contributions to the toolkit from the community."
2507.11546,"The year 2024 witnessed accelerated global AI governance advancements, marked by strengthened multilateral frameworks and proliferating national regulatory initiatives. This acceleration underscores an unprecedented need to systematically track governance progress--an imperative that drove the launch of the AI Governance InternationaL Evaluation Index (AGILE Index) project since 2023. The inaugural AGILE Index, released in February 2024 after assessing 14 countries, established an operational and comparable baseline framework. Building on pilot insights, AGILE Index 2025 incorporates systematic refinements to better balance scientific rigor with practical adaptability. The updated methodology expands data diversity while enhancing metric validity and cross-national comparability. Reflecting both research advancements and practical policy evolution, AGILE Index 2025 evaluates 40 countries across income levels, regions, and technological development stages, with 4 Pillars, 17 Dimensions and 43 Indicators. In compiling the data, the team integrates multi-source evidence including policy documents, governance practices, research outputs, and risk exposure to construct a unified comparison framework. This approach maps global disparities while enabling countries to identify governance strengths, gaps, and systemic constraints. Through ongoing refinement and iterations, we hope the AGILE Index will fundamentally advance transparency and measurability in global AI governance, delivering data-driven assessments that depict national AI governance capacity, assist governments in recognizing their maturation stages and critical governance issues, and ultimately provide actionable insights for enhancing AI governance systems nationally and globally."
2507.11548,"The increasing use of generative AI for resume screening is predicated on the assumption that it offers an unbiased alternative to biased human decision-making. However, this belief fails to address a critical question: are these AI systems fundamentally competent at the evaluative tasks they are meant to perform?This study investigates the question of competence through a two-part audit of eight major AI platforms. Experiment 1 confirmed complex, contextual racial and gender biases, with some models penalizing candidates merely for the presence of demographic signals. Experiment 2, which evaluated core competence, provided a critical insight: some models that appeared unbiased were, in fact, incapable of performing a substantive evaluation, relying instead on superficial keyword matching.This paper introduces the ""Illusion of Neutrality"" to describe this phenomenon, where an apparent lack of bias is merely a symptom of a model's inability to make meaningful judgments. This study recommends that organizations and regulators adopt a dual-validation framework, auditing AI hiring tools for both demographic bias and demonstrable competence to ensure they are both equitable and effective."
2507.11552,"This paper presents a theoretical framework for the AI ethical resonance hypothesis, which proposes that advanced AI systems with purposefully designed cognitive structures (""ethical resonators"") may emerge with the ability to identify subtle moral patterns that are invisible to the human mind. The paper explores the possibility that by processing and synthesizing large amounts of ethical contexts, AI systems may discover moral meta-patterns that transcend cultural, historical, and individual biases, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of universal ethical foundations. The paper also examines a paradoxical aspect of the hypothesis, in which AI systems could potentially deepen our understanding of what we traditionally consider essentially human - our capacity for ethical reflection."
2507.11559,"In recent years, cognitive and mental health (CMH) disorders have increasingly become an important challenge for global public health, especially the suicide problem caused by multiple factors such as social competition, economic pressure and interpersonal relationships among young and middle-aged people. Social media, as an important platform for individuals to express emotions and seek help, provides the possibility for early detection and intervention of suicide risk. This paper introduces a large-scale dataset containing 15,000 user-level posts. Compared with existing datasets, this dataset retains complete user posting time sequence information, supports modeling the dynamic evolution of suicide risk, and we have also conducted comprehensive and rigorous annotations on these datasets. In the benchmark experiment, we systematically evaluated the performance of traditional machine learning methods, deep learning models, and fine-tuned large language models. The experimental results show that our dataset can effectively support the automatic assessment task of suicide risk. Considering the sensitivity of mental health data, we also discussed the privacy protection and ethical use of the dataset. In addition, we also explored the potential applications of the dataset in mental health testing, clinical psychiatric auxiliary treatment, etc., and provided directional suggestions for future research work."
2507.11567,"Since the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, the AI landscape is undergoing a rapid transformation. Currently, the use of AI chatbots by consumers has largely been limited to image generation or question-answering language models. The next generation of AI systems, AI agents that can plan and execute complex tasks with only limited human involvement, will be capable of a much broader range of actions. In particular, consumers could soon be able to delegate purchasing decisions to AI agents acting as Custobots. Against this background, the Article explores whether EU consumer law, as it currently stands, is ready for the rise of the Custobot Economy. In doing so, the Article makes three contributions. First, it outlines how the advent of AI agents could change the existing e-commerce landscape. Second, it explains how AI agents challenge the premises of a human-centric consumer law which is based on the assumption that consumption decisions are made by humans. Third, the Article presents some initial considerations how a future consumer law could look like that works for both humans and machines."
2507.11597,"AI is transforming research. It is being leveraged to construct surveys, synthesize data, conduct analysis, and write summaries of the results. While the promise is to create efficiencies and increase quality, the reality is not always as clear cut. Leveraging our framework of Truth, Beauty, and Justice (TBJ) which we use to evaluate AI, machine learning and computational models for effective and ethical use (Taber and Timpone 1997; Timpone and Yang 2024), we consider the potential and limitation of analytic, generative, and agentic AI to augment data scientists or take on tasks traditionally done by human analysts and researchers. While AI can be leveraged to assist analysts in their tasks, we raise some warnings about push-button automation. Just as earlier eras of survey analysis created some issues when the increased ease of using statistical software allowed researchers to conduct analyses they did not fully understand, the new AI tools may create similar but larger risks. We emphasize a human-machine collaboration perspective (Daugherty and Wilson 2018) throughout the data science workflow and particularly call out the vital role that data scientists play under VUCA decision areas. We conclude by encouraging the advance of AI tools to complement data scientists but advocate for continued training and understanding of methods to ensure the substantive value of research is fully achieved by applying, interpreting, and acting upon results most effectively and ethically."
2507.11773,"The emergence of breakthrough artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has led to a renewed focus on how small data settings, i.e., settings with limited information, can benefit from such developments. This includes societal issues such as how best to include under-represented groups in data-driven policy and decision making, or the health benefits of assistive technologies such as wearables. We provide a conceptual overview, in particular contrasting small data with big data, and identify common themes from exemplary case studies and application areas. Potential solutions are described in a more detailed technical overview of current data analysis and modelling techniques, highlighting contributions from different disciplines, such as knowledge-driven modelling from statistics and data-driven modelling from computer science. By linking application settings, conceptual contributions and specific techniques, we highlight what is already feasible and suggest what an agenda for fully leveraging small data might look like."
2507.11802,"Research experience is crucial for computing master's students pursuing academic and scientific careers, yet online students have traditionally been excluded from these opportunities due to the physical constraints of traditional research environments. This paper presents the Framework for Accelerating Interdisciplinary Research in Computer Science (FAIR-CS), a method for achieving research goals, developing research communities, and supporting high quality mentorship in an online research environment. This method advances virtual research operations by orchestrating dynamic partnerships between master's level researchers and academic mentors, resulting in interdisciplinary publications. We then discuss the implementation of FAIR-CS in the Human-Augmented Analytics Group (HAAG), with researchers from the Georgia Tech's Online Master of Computer Science program. Through documented project records and experiences with 72 active users, we present our lessons learned and evaluate the evolution of FAIR-CS in HAAG. This paper serves as a comprehensive resource for other institutions seeking to establish similar virtual research initiatives, demonstrating how the traditional research lab environment can be effectively replicated in the virtual space while maintaining robust collaborative relationships and supporting knowledge transfer."
2507.12162,"Measuring online behavioural student engagement often relies on simple count indicators or retrospective, predictive methods, which present challenges for real-time application. To address these limitations, we reconceptualise an existing course-wide engagement metric to create a chapter-based version that aligns with the weekly structure of online courses. Derived directly from virtual learning environment log data, the new metric allows for cumulative, real-time tracking of student activity without requiring outcome data or model training. We evaluate the approach across three undergraduate statistics modules over two academic years, comparing it to the course-wide formulation to assess how the reconceptualisation influences what is measured. Results indicate strong alignment from as early as week 3, along with comparable or improved predictive validity for final grades in structured, lecture-based contexts. By the course midpoint, the weekly metric identifies as many low-performing students as are identifiable by the end of the course. While performance varies across modules, the chapter-based formulation offers a scalable and interpretable method for early engagement monitoring and student support."
2507.12488,"When teaching Programming and Software Engineering in Bachelor's Degree programs, the emphasis on creating functional software projects often overshadows the focus on software quality, a trend that aligns with ACM curricula recommendations. Software Engineering courses are typically introduced later in the curriculum, and can generally allocate only limited time to quality-related topics, leaving educators with the challenge of deciding which quality aspects to prioritize. In this decision, the literature offers limited guidance, as most existing studies focus on code written by novice students and small code units, making it unclear whether those findings extend to intermediate-level students with foundational object-oriented programming skills working on more complex software projects. To address this gap, we analyze 83 object-oriented team projects developed by 172 university students across 4 different editions of the Object-Oriented Programming course. We apply a static analysis pipeline used in prior research to assess software quality, combining SonarQube and ArchUnit to detect code smells and architectural anti-patterns. Our findings highlight recurring quality issues and offer concrete evidence of the challenges students face at this stage, providing valuable guidance for educators aiming to continuously improve Software Engineering curricula and promote quality-oriented development practices."
2507.12571,"The prevalence of short form video platforms, combined with the ineffectiveness of age verification mechanisms, raises concerns about the potential harms facing children and teenagers in an algorithm-moderated online environment. We conducted multimodal feature analysis and thematic topic modeling of 4,492 short videos recommended to children and teenagers on Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts, collected as a part of an algorithm auditing experiment. This feature-level and content-level analysis revealed that unsafe (i.e., problematic, mentally distressing) short videos (a) possess darker visual features and (b) contain explicitly harmful content and implicit harm from anxiety-inducing ordinary content. We introduce a useful framework of online harm (i.e., explicit, implicit, unintended), providing a unique lens for understanding the dynamic, multifaceted online risks facing children and teenagers. The findings highlight the importance of protecting younger audiences in critical developmental stages from both explicit and implicit risks on social media, calling for nuanced content moderation, age verification, and platform regulation."
2507.12674,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on programming tasks, but can they generate student-like code like real students - imperfect, iterative, and stylistically diverse? We present ParaStudent, a systematic study of LLM-based ""student-like"" code generation in an introductory programming course setting. Using a dataset of timestamped student submissions across multiple semesters, we design low- and high-resolution experiments to model student progress and evaluate code outputs along semantic, functional, and stylistic dimensions. Our results show that fine-tuning significantly improves alignment with real student trajectories and captures error patterns, incremental improvements, and stylistic variations more faithfully. This study shows that modeling realistic student code requires capturing learning dynamics through context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional evaluation. Code for experiments and evaluation is available atthis https URL."
2507.12713,"The proliferation of generative AI systems has created new challenges for the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) community, particularly regarding how traditional copyleft principles should apply when open source code is used to train AI models. This article introduces the Contextual Copyleft AI (CCAI) license, a novel licensing mechanism that extends copyleft requirements from training data to the resulting generative AI models. The CCAI license offers significant advantages, including enhanced developer control, incentivization of open source AI development, and mitigation of openwashing practices. This is demonstrated through a structured three-part evaluation framework that examines (1) legal feasibility under current copyright law, (2) policy justification comparing traditional software and AI contexts, and (3) synthesis of cross-contextual benefits and risks. However, the increased risk profile of open source AI, particularly the potential for direct misuse, necessitates complementary regulatory approaches to achieve an appropriate risk-benefit balance. The paper concludes that when implemented within a robust regulatory environment focused on responsible AI usage, the CCAI license provides a viable mechanism for preserving and adapting core FOSS principles to the evolving landscape of generative AI development."
2507.12957,"Emerging technologies challenge conventional governance approaches, especially when uncertainty is not a temporary obstacle but a foundational feature as in quantum computing. This paper reframes uncertainty from a governance liability to a generative force, using the paradigms of quantum mechanics to propose adaptive, probabilistic frameworks for responsible innovation. We identify three interdependent layers of uncertainty--physical, technical, and societal--central to the evolution of quantum technologies. The proposed Quantum Risk Simulator (QRS) serves as a conceptual example, an imaginative blueprint rather than a prescriptive tool, meant to illustrate how probabilistic reasoning could guide dynamic, uncertainty-based governance. By foregrounding epistemic and ontological ambiguity, and drawing analogies from cognitive neuroscience and predictive processing, we suggest a new model of governance aligned with the probabilistic essence of quantum systems. This model, we argue, is especially promising for the European Union as a third way between laissez-faire innovation and state-led control, offering a flexible yet responsible pathway for regulating quantum and other frontier technologies."
2507.13008,"As the field of Trust and Safety in digital spaces continues to grow, it has become increasingly necessary - but also increasingly complex - to collaborate on research across the academic, industry, governmental and non-governmental sectors. This paper examines how cross-affiliation research partnerships can be structured to overcome misaligned incentives, timelines and constraints while delivering on the unique strengths of each stakeholder. Drawing on our own experience of cross-sector collaboration, we define the main types of affiliation and highlight the common differences in research priorities, operational pressures and evaluation metrics across sectors. We then propose a practical, step-by-step framework for initiating and managing effective collaborations, including strategies for building trust, aligning goals, and distributing roles. We emphasize the critical yet often invisible work of articulation and argue that cross-sector partnerships are essential for developing more ethical, equitable and impactful research in trust and safety. Ultimately, we advocate collaborative models that prioritize inclusivity, transparency and real-world relevance in order to meet the interdisciplinary demands of this emerging field."
2507.131,"Shared Mobility Services (SMS), e.g., demand-responsive transport or ride-sharing, can improve mobility in low-density areas, which are often poorly served by conventional Public Transport (PT). Such improvement is generally measured via basic performance indicators, such as waiting or travel time. However, such basic indicators do not account for the most important contribution that SMS can provide to territories, i.e., increasing the potential, for users, to reach surrounding opportunities, such as jobs, schools, businesses, etc. Such potential can be measured by isochrone-based accessibility indicators, which count the number of opportunities reachable in a limited time, and are thus easy for the public to understand. % The potential impact of SMS on accessibility has been qualitatively discussed and implications on equity have been empirically studied. However, to date, there are no quantitative methods to compute isochrone-based indicators of the accessibility achieved via SMS.This work fills this gap by proposing a first method to compute isochrone accessibility of PT systems composed of conventional PT and SMS, acting as a feeder for access and egress trips to/from PT hubs. This method is grounded on spatial-temporal statistical analysis, performed via Kriging. It takes as input observed trips of SMS and summarizes them in a graph. On such a graph, isochrone accessibility indicators are computed. We apply the proposed method to a MATSim simulation study concerning demand-responsive transport integrated into PT, in the suburban area of Paris-Saclay."
2507.13517,"International coordination faces significant friction due to reliance on periodic summits, bilateral consultations, and fragmented communication channels that impede rapid collective responses to emerging global challenges while limiting transparency to constituents. We present the Stated Protocol, a decentralized framework that enables organizations to coordinate through standardized text statements published on their website domains. While applicable to all organizations, this work focuses primarily on the application in international relations, where the protocol enables rapid consensus discovery and collective decision-making without relying on centralized social media platforms. We explore specific applications: (1) faster treaty negotiation through incremental micro-agreements that can be signed digitally within hours rather than months, (2) continuous and transparent operation of international institutions through asynchronous decision-making, (3) coordinated signaling from local governments to national authorities through simultaneous statement publication, and (4) coalition formation among non-governmental organizations through transparent position aggregation."
2507.13758,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), evolved from standard Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly utilized as automated judges because of their explicit reasoning processes. Yet we show that both LRMs and standard LLMs are vulnerable to Fake Reasoning Bias (FRB), where models favor the surface structure of reasoning even when the logic is flawed. To study this problem, we introduce THEATER, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically investigates FRB by manipulating reasoning structures to test whether language models are misled by superficial or fabricated cues. It covers two FRB types: (1) Simple Cues, minimal cues that resemble reasoning processes, and (2) Fake CoT, fabricated chains of thought that simulate multi-step reasoning. We evaluate 17 advanced LLMs and LRMs on both subjective DPO and factual datasets. Our results reveal four key findings: (1) Both LLMs and LRMs are vulnerable to FRB, but LLMs are generally more robust than LRMs. (2) Simple Cues are especially harmful, reducing accuracy by up to 15% on the most vulnerable datasets. (3) Subjective DPO tasks are the most vulnerable, with LRMs suffering sharper drops than LLMs. (4) Analysis of LRMs' thinking traces shows that Simple Cues hijack metacognitive confidence, while Fake CoT is absorbed as internal thought, creating a ""more thinking, less robust"" paradox in LRMs. Finally, prompt-based mitigation improves accuracy on factual tasks by up to 10%, but has little effect on subjective tasks, where self-reflection sometimes lowers LRM performance by 8%. These results highlight FRB as a persistent and unresolved challenge for language models."
2507.13802,"In the European Union, official food safety monitoring data collected by member states are submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and published on Zenodo. This data includes 392 million analytical results derived from over 15.2 million samples covering more than 4,000 different types of food products, offering great opportunities for artificial intelligence to analyze trends, predict hazards, and support early warning systems. However, the current format with data distributed across approximately 1000 files totaling several hundred gigabytes hinders accessibility and analysis. To address this, we introduce the CompreHensive European Food Safety (CHEFS) database, which consolidates EFSA monitoring data on pesticide residues, veterinary medicinal product residues, and chemical contaminants into a unified and structured dataset. We describe the creation and structure of the CHEFS database and demonstrate its potential by analyzing trends in European food safety monitoring data from 2000 to 2024. Our analyses explore changes in monitoring activities, the most frequently tested products, which products were most often non-compliant and which contaminants were most often found, and differences across countries. These findings highlight the CHEFS database as both a centralized data source and a strategic tool for guiding food safety policy, research, and regulation."
2507.13837,"Automated vehicles (AVs) increasingly encounter ethically ambiguous situations in everyday driving--scenarios involving conflicting human interests and lacking clearly optimal courses of action. While existing ethical models often focus on rare, high-stakes dilemmas (e.g., crash avoidance or trolley problems), routine decisions such as overtaking cyclists or navigating social interactions remain underexplored. This study addresses that gap by applying the tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC), which holds that AV behaviour should align with human reasons--defined as the values, intentions, and expectations that justify actions. We conducted qualitative interviews with 18 AV experts to identify the types of reasons that should inform AV manoeuvre planning. Thirteen categories of reasons emerged, organised across normative, strategic, tactical, and operational levels, and linked to the roles of relevant human agents. A case study on cyclist overtaking illustrates how these reasons interact in context, revealing a consistent prioritisation of safety, contextual flexibility regarding regulatory compliance, and nuanced trade-offs involving efficiency, comfort, and public acceptance. Based on these insights, we propose a principled conceptual framework for AV decision-making in routine, ethically ambiguous scenarios. The framework supports dynamic, human-aligned behaviour by prioritising safety, allowing pragmatic actions when strict legal adherence would undermine key values, and enabling constrained deviations when appropriately justified. This empirically grounded approach advances current guidance by offering actionable, context-sensitive design principles for ethically aligned AV systems."
2507.13936,"Over 90% of new vehicles in the United States now collect and transmit telematics data. Similar trends are seen in other developed countries. Transportation planners have previously utilized telematics data in various forms, but its current scale offers significant new opportunities in traffic measurement, classification, planning, and control. Despite these opportunities, the enormous volume of data and lack of standardization across manufacturers necessitates a clearer understanding of the data and improved data processing methods for extracting actionable insights.This paper takes a step towards addressing these needs through four primary objectives. First, a data processing pipeline was built to efficiently analyze 1.4 billion miles (120 million trips) of telematics data collected in Virginia between August 2021 and August 2022. Second, an open data repository of trip and roadway segment level summaries was created. Third, interactive visualization tools were designed to extract insights from these data about trip-taking behavior and the speed profiles of roadways. Finally, major challenges that were faced during processing this data are summarized and recommendations to overcome them are provided. This work will help manufacturers collecting the data and transportation professionals using the data to develop a better understanding of the possibilities and major pitfalls to avoid."
2507.14218,"Artificial intelligence functions not as an epistemic leveller, but as an accelerant of cognitive stratification, entrenching and formalising informational castes within liberal-democratic societies. Synthesising formal epistemology, political theory, algorithmic architecture, and economic incentive structures, the argument traces how contemporary AI systems selectively amplify the reasoning capacity of individuals equipped with recursive abstraction, symbolic logic, and adversarial interrogation, whilst simultaneously pacifying the cognitively untrained through engagement-optimised interfaces. Fluency replaces rigour, immediacy displaces reflection, and procedural reasoning is eclipsed by reactive suggestion. The result is a technocratic realignment of power: no longer grounded in material capital alone, but in the capacity to navigate, deconstruct, and manipulate systems of epistemic production. Information ceases to be a commons; it becomes the substrate through which consent is manufactured and autonomy subdued. Deliberative democracy collapses not through censorship, but through the erosion of interpretive agency. The proposed response is not technocratic regulation, nor universal access, but the reconstruction of rational autonomy as a civic mandate, codified in education, protected by epistemic rights, and structurally embedded within open cognitive infrastructure."
2507.14221,"The automated summarisation of parliamentary debates using large language models (LLMs) offers a promising way to make complex legislative discourse more accessible to the public. However, such summaries must not only be accurate and concise but also equitably represent the views and contributions of all speakers. This paper explores the use of LLMs to summarise plenary debates from the European Parliament and investigates the algorithmic and representational biases that emerge in this context. We propose a structured, multi-stage summarisation framework that improves textual coherence and content fidelity, while enabling the systematic analysis of how speaker attributes -- such as speaking order or political affiliation -- influence the visibility and accuracy of their contributions in the final summaries. Through our experiments using both proprietary and open-weight LLMs, we find evidence of consistent positional and partisan biases, with certain speakers systematically under-represented or misattributed. Our analysis shows that these biases vary by model and summarisation strategy, with hierarchical approaches offering the greatest potential to reduce disparity. These findings underscore the need for domain-sensitive evaluation metrics and ethical oversight in the deployment of LLMs for democratic applications."
2507.14226,"A scan of 110 AI companion platforms reveals a rapidly growing global market for emotionally engaging, personalized AI interactions. While parasocial use of general-purpose AI (GPAI) tools currently dominates, a growing number of platforms are designed specifically for care, transactional, or mating companionship. In the UK alone, these platforms receive between 46 million and 91 million monthly visits (1.1-2.2 billion globally), with users spending an average of 3.5 minutes per session. For context, Instagram averaged 67.3 million UK visits per month between January and March 2025. Notably, mating-oriented AI companions make up 44% of UK visits (higher than the global average of 30%) but see lower session times and return rates than mixed-use platforms. As mating-oriented romantic AI offerings improve, increased engagement may follow, raising urgent concerns about online safety, particularly for children, given weak age safeguards. Meanwhile, GPAI tools are moving toward more emotionally intelligent, personalized interactions, making parasocial AI use increasingly mainstream. These trends highlight the need for the UK AI Security Institute (AISI) to monitor this sector and assess whether existing regulation sufficiently addresses emerging societal risks."
2507.14233,"We present an agent-based model (ABM) simulating proactive community adaptation to climate change in an urban context. The model is applied to Bergen, Norway, represented as a complex socio-ecological system. It integrates multiple agent types: municipal government (urban planners and political actors), civil society (individual citizens), environmental NGOs and activists, and media. Agents interact during urban planning processes - particularly the evaluation and approval of new development proposals. Urban planners provide technical assessments, while politicians (organized by party) make final decisions to approve, modify, or reject projects. Environmental NGOs, activist groups, and the media shape public perception and influence policymakers through campaigns, lobbying, protests, and news coverage. Individual citizens decide whether to engage in collective action based on personal values and social influences. The model captures the resulting decision-making ecosystem and reveals feedback loops and leverage points that determine climate-adaptive outcomes. By analyzing these dynamics, we identify critical intervention points where targeted policy measures can facilitate systemic transformation toward more climate-resilient urban development."
2507.14235,"Automated grading systems, or auto-graders, have become ubiquitous in programming education, and the way they generate feedback has become increasingly automated as well. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding auto-grader feedback's effectiveness in improving student learning outcomes, in a way that differentiates students who utilized the feedback and students who did not. In this study, we fill this critical gap. Specifically, we analyze students' interactions with auto-graders in an introductory Python programming course, offered at five community colleges in the United States. Our results show that students checking the feedback more frequently tend to get higher scores from their programming assignments overall. Our results also show that a submission that follows a student checking the feedback tends to receive a higher score than a submission that follows a student ignoring the feedback. Our results provide evidence on auto-grader feedback's effectiveness, encourage their increased utilization, and call for future work to continue their evaluation in this age of automation"
2507.14236,"This study explores the relationship between voter trust and their experiences during elections by applying a rule-based data mining technique to the 2022 Survey of the Performance of American Elections (SPAE). Using the Apriori algorithm and setting parameters to capture meaningful associations (support >= 3%, confidence >= 60%, and lift > 1.5), the analysis revealed a strong connection between demographic attributes and voting-related challenges, such as registration hurdles, accessibility issues, and queue times. For instance, respondents who indicated that accessing polling stations was ""very easy"" and who reported moderate confidence were found to be over six times more likely (lift = 6.12) to trust their county's election outcome and experience no registration issues. A further analysis, which adjusted the support threshold to 2%, specifically examined patterns among minority voters. It revealed that 98.16 percent of Black voters who reported easy access to polling locations also had smooth registration experiences. Additionally, those who had high confidence in the vote-counting process were almost two times as likely to identify as Democratic Party supporters. These findings point to the important role that enhancing voting access and offering targeted support can play in building trust in the electoral system, particularly among marginalized communities."
2507.14242,"While Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not a new field, recent developments, especially with the release of generative tools like ChatGPT, have brought it to the forefront of the minds of industry workers and academic folk alike. There is currently much talk about AI and its ability to reshape many everyday processes as we know them through automation. It also allows users to expand their ideas by suggesting things they may not have thought of on their own and provides easier access to information. However, not all of the changes this technology will bring or has brought so far are positive; this is why it is extremely important for all modern people to recognize and understand the risks before using these tools and allowing them to cause harm. This work takes a position on better understanding many equity concerns and the spread of misinformation that result from new AI, in this case, specifically ChatGPT and deepfakes, and encouraging collaboration with law enforcement, developers, and users to reduce harm. Considering many academic sources, it warns against these issues, analyzing their cause and impact in fields including healthcare, education, science, academia, retail, and finance. Lastly, we propose a set of future-facing guidelines and policy considerations to solve these issues while still enabling innovation in these fields, this responsibility falling upon users, developers, and government entities."
2507.14258,"The peer review process for scientific publications faces significant challenges due to the increasing volume of submissions and inherent reviewer biases. While artificial intelligence offers the potential to facilitate the process, it also risks perpetuating biases present in training data. This research addresses these challenges by applying formal methods from argumentation theory to support transparent and unbiased dispute resolution in peer review. Specifically, we conceptualize scientific peer review as a single mixed argumentative dispute between manuscript authors and reviewers and formalize it using abstract argumentation frameworks. We analyze the resulting peer review argumentation frameworks from semantic, graph-theoretic, and computational perspectives, showing that they are well-founded and decidable in linear time. These frameworks are then implemented using OWL DL and resolved with reasoning engines. We validate our approach by annotating a corpus of scientific peer reviews with abstract argumentation frameworks and applying a proof of concept to resolve the annotated disputes. The results demonstrate that integrating our method could enhance the quality of published work by providing a more rigorous and systematic approach to accounting reviewer arguments."
2507.14266,"Over the past decade, higher education has evolved through three distinct paradigms: the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), the integration of Smart Teaching technologies into classrooms, and the rise of AI-enhanced learning. Each paradigm is intended to address specific challenges in traditional education: MOOCs enable ubiquitous access to learning resources; Smart Teaching supports real-time interaction with data-driven insights; and generative AI offers personalized feedback and on-demand content generation. However, these paradigms are often implemented in isolation due to their disparate technological origins and policy-driven adoption. This paper examines the origins, strengths, and limitations of each paradigm, and advocates a unified pedagogical perspective that synthesizes their complementary affordances. We propose a three-layer instructional framework that combines the scalability of MOOCs, the responsiveness of Smart Teaching, and the adaptivity of AI. To demonstrate its feasibility, we present a curriculum design for a project-based course. The findings highlight the framework's potential to enhance learner engagement, support instructors, and enable personalized yet scalable learning."
2507.14339,"Brain foundation models represent a new frontier in AI: instead of processing text or images, these models interpret real-time neural signals from EEG, fMRI, and other neurotechnologies. When integrated with brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), they may enable transformative applications-from thought controlled devices to neuroprosthetics-by interpreting and acting on brain activity in milliseconds. However, these same systems pose unprecedented risks, including the exploitation of subconscious neural signals and the erosion of cognitive liberty. Users cannot easily observe or control how their brain signals are interpreted, creating power asymmetries that are vulnerable to manipulation. This paper proposes embedding fiduciary duties-loyalty, care, and confidentiality-directly into BCI-integrated brain foundation models through technical design. Drawing on legal traditions and recent advancements in AI alignment techniques, we outline implementable architectural and governance mechanisms to ensure these systems act in users' best interests. Placing brain foundation models on a fiduciary footing is essential to realizing their potential without compromising self-determination."
2507.14755,"We introduce a risk assessment framework for digital identification systems, as well as recommended best practices to enhance privacy, security, and other desirable properties in these systems. To generate these resources, we created a casebook of a wide range of digital identification systems, and we then applied expert analysis and critique to identify patterns. We piloted the framework on several reviews within our organization over a period of approximately one year, and found it to be robust and helpful for those reviews. This work is intended to inform product review and development, product policy, and standards efforts, and to help guide a consistent responsible approach to digital identification across the broader digital identification ecosystem."
2507.1486,"This study investigates the strategic and epistemically responsible integration of AI-powered chatbots into physics teacher education by employing a TPACK-guided SWOT framework across three structured learning activities. Conducted within a university-level capstone course on innovative tools for physics instruction, the activities targeted key intersections of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) through chatbot-assisted tasks: simplifying abstract physics concepts, constructing symbolic concept maps, and designing instructional scenarios. Drawing on participant reflections, classroom artifacts, and iterative feedback, the results highlight internal strengths such as enhanced information-seeking behavior, scaffolded pedagogical planning, and support for symbolic reasoning. At the same time, internal weaknesses emerged, including domain-specific inaccuracies, symbolic limitations (e.g., LaTeX misrendering), and risks of overreliance on AI outputs. External opportunities were found in promoting inclusive education, multilingual engagement, and expanded zones of proximal development (ZPD), while external threats included prompt injection risks, institutional access gaps, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities. By extending existing TPACK-based models with constructs such as AI literacy, prompt-crafting competence, and epistemic verification protocols, this research offers a theoretically grounded and practically actionable roadmap for embedding AI in STEM teacher preparation. The findings affirm that, when critically scaffolded, AI chatbots can support metacognitive reflection, ethical reasoning, and instructional innovation in physics education if implementation is paired with digital fluency training and institutional support."
2507.15299,"This paper provides an overview and critique of the risk based model of artificial intelligence (AI) governance that has become a popular approach to AI regulation across multiple jurisdictions. The 'AI Policy Landscape in Europe, North America and Australia' section summarises the existing AI policy efforts across these jurisdictions, with a focus of the EU AI Act and the Australian Department of Industry, Science and Regulation's (DISR) safe and responsible AI consultation. The 'Analysis' section of this paper proposes several criticisms of the risk based approach to AI governance, arguing that the construction and calculation of risks that they use reproduces existing inequalities. Drawing on the work of Julia Black, it argues that risk and harm should be distinguished clearly and that the notion of risk is problematic as its inherent normativity reproduces dominant and harmful narratives about whose interests matter, and risk categorizations should be subject to deep scrutiny. This paper concludes with the suggestion that existing risk governance scholarship can provide valuable insights toward the improvement of the risk based AI governance, and that the use of multiple regulatory implements and responsive risk regulation should be considered in the continuing development of the model."
2507.15379,"Taxes finance important government services that are now taken for granted in our society, such as infrastructure, health care, or retirement pensions. Tax authorities everywhere strive to ensure that all individuals and organizations comply with applicable tax laws. In this regard, tax authorities must prevent individuals and organizations from evading taxes in an illegal manner. To this end, Austrian tax authorities employ state-of-the-art predictive analytics technology for the selection of suspicious cases for tax audits, thus making efficient use of scarce resources for tax auditing. In this paper, we explore how Austrian tax authorities employ predictive analytics technology in tax auditing and how well the use of such technology fits the characteristics of the task at hand. We collaborated with the Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance's Predictive Analytics Competence Center to obtain insights into the application of predictive analytics technology by Austrian tax authorities. The thus obtained insights serve as the basis for a qualitative analysis in the context of the task-technology fit framework."
2507.15585,"One way social groups are marginalized in discourse is that the narratives told about them often default to a narrow, stereotyped range of topics. In contrast, default groups are allowed the full complexity of human existence. We describe the constrained representations of queer people in LLM generations in terms of harmful representations, narrow representations, and discursive othering and formulate hypotheses to test for these phenomena. Our results show that LLMs are significantly limited in their portrayals of queer personas."
2507.15617,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) - particularly generative AI - present new opportunities to accelerate, or even automate, epidemiological research. Unlike disciplines based on physical experimentation, a sizable fraction of Epidemiology relies on secondary data analysis and thus is well-suited for such augmentation. Yet, it remains unclear which specific tasks can benefit from AI interventions or where roadblocks exist. Awareness of current AI capabilities is also mixed. Here, we map the landscape of epidemiological tasks using existing datasets - from literature review to data access, analysis, writing up, and dissemination - and identify where existing AI tools offer efficiency gains. While AI can increase productivity in some areas such as coding and administrative tasks, its utility is constrained by limitations of existing AI models (e.g. hallucinations in literature reviews) and human systems (e.g. barriers to accessing datasets). Through examples of AI-generated epidemiological outputs, including fully AI-generated papers, we demonstrate that recently developed agentic systems can now design and execute epidemiological analysis, albeit to varied quality (seethis https URL). Epidemiologists have new opportunities to empirically test and benchmark AI systems; realising the potential of AI will require two-way engagement between epidemiologists and engineers."
2507.15771,"How does AI think about economic policy? While the use of large language models (LLMs) in economics is growing exponentially, their assumptions on economic issues remain a black box. This paper uses a conjoint experiment to tease out the main factors influencing LLMs' evaluation of economic policy. It finds that LLMs are most sensitive to unemployment, inequality, financial stability, and environmental harm and less sensitive to traditional macroeconomic concerns such as economic growth, inflation, and government debt. The results are remarkably consistent across scenarios and across models."
2507.15821,"LLM use in annotation is becoming widespread, and given LLMs' overall promising performance and speed, simply ""reviewing"" LLM annotations in interpretive tasks can be tempting. In subjective annotation tasks with multiple plausible answers, reviewing LLM outputs can change the label distribution, impacting both the evaluation of LLM performance, and analysis using these labels in a social science task downstream. We conducted a pre-registered experiment with 410 unique annotators and over 7,000 annotations testing three AI assistance conditions against controls, using two models, and two datasets. We find that presenting crowdworkers with LLM-generated annotation suggestions did not make them faster, but did improve their self-reported confidence in the task. More importantly, annotators strongly took the LLM suggestions, significantly changing the label distribution compared to the baseline. When these labels created with LLM assistance are used to evaluate LLM performance, reported model performance significantly increases. We believe our work underlines the importance of understanding the impact of LLM-assisted annotation on subjective, qualitative tasks, on the creation of gold data for training and testing, and on the evaluation of NLP systems on subjective tasks."
2507.15886,"Monitoring AIs at runtime can help us detect and stop harmful actions. In this paper, we study how to efficiently combine multiple runtime monitors into a single monitoring protocol. The protocol's objective is to maximize the probability of applying a safety intervention on misaligned outputs (i.e., maximize recall). Since running monitors and applying safety interventions are costly, the protocol also needs to adhere to an average-case budget constraint. Taking the monitors' performance and cost as given, we develop an algorithm to find the best protocol. The algorithm exhaustively searches over when and which monitors to call, and allocates safety interventions based on the Neyman-Pearson lemma. By focusing on likelihood ratios and strategically trading off spending on monitors against spending on interventions, we more than double our recall rate compared to a naive baseline in a code review setting. We also show that combining two monitors can Pareto dominate using either monitor alone. Our framework provides a principled methodology for combining existing monitors to detect undesirable behavior in cost-sensitive settings."
2507.15916,"The risks of frontier AI may require international cooperation, which in turn may require verification: checking that all parties follow agreed-on rules. For instance, states might need to verify that powerful AI models are widely deployed only after their risks to international security have been evaluated and deemed manageable. However, research on AI verification could benefit from greater clarity and detail. To address this, this report provides an in-depth overview of AI verification, intended for both policy professionals and technical researchers. We present novel conceptual frameworks, detailed implementation options, and key R&D challenges. These draw on existing literature, expert interviews, and original analysis, all within the scope of confidentially overseeing AI development and deployment that uses thousands of high-end AI chips. We find that states could eventually verify compliance by using six largely independent verification approaches with substantial redundancy: (1) built-in security features in AI chips; (2-3) separate monitoring devices attached to AI chips; and (4-6) personnel-based mechanisms, such as whistleblower programs. While promising, these approaches require guardrails to protect against abuse and power concentration, and many of these technologies have yet to be built or stress-tested. To enable states to confidently verify compliance with rules on large-scale AI development and deployment, the R&D challenges we list need significant progress."
2507.16045,"Online content creators spend significant time and effort building their user base through a long, often arduous process, which requires finding the right ``niche'' to cater to. So, what incentive is there for an established content creator known for cat memes to completely reinvent their page channel and start promoting cryptocurrency services or cover electoral news events? And, if they do, do their existing subscribers not notice? We explore this problem of \textit{repurposed channels}, whereby a channel changes its identity and contents. We first characterize a market for ``second-hand'' social media accounts, which recorded sales exceeding USD~1M during our 6-month observation period. By observing YouTube channels (re)sold over these 6~months, we find that a substantial number (37\%) are used to disseminate potentially harmful content, often without facing any penalty. Even more surprisingly, these channels seem to gain rather than lose subscribers. To estimate the prevalence of channel repurposing ``in the wild,'' we also collect two snapshots of 1.4M quasi-randomly sampled YouTube accounts. In a 3-month period, we estimate that $\sim$0.25\% channels -- collectively holding $\sim$44M subscribers -- were repurposed. We confirm that these repurposed channels share several characteristics with sold channels -- mainly, the fact that they had a significantly high presence of potentially problematic content. Across repurposed channels, we find channels that became disinformation channels, as well as channels that link to web pages with financial scams. We reason that abusing the residual trust placed on these channels is advantageous to financially- and ideologically-motivated adversaries. This phenomenon is not exclusive to YouTube and we posit that the market for cultivating organic audiences is set to grow, particularly if it remains unchallenged by mitigations, technical or otherwise."
2507.1613,"People with disabilities (PwD) experience disproportionately high levels of discrimination and hate online, particularly in India, where entrenched stigma and limited resources intensify these challenges. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to identify and mitigate online hate, yet most research on online ableism focuses on Western audiences with Western AI models. Are these models adequately equipped to recognize ableist harm in non-Western places like India? Do localized, Indic language models perform better? To investigate, we adopted and translated a publicly available ableist speech dataset to Hindi, and prompted eight LLMs--four developed in the U.S. (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Llama) and four in India (Krutrim, Nanda, Gajendra, Airavata)--to score and explain ableism. In parallel, we recruited 175 PwD from both the U.S. and India to perform the same task, revealing stark differences between groups. Western LLMs consistently overestimated ableist harm, while Indic LLMs underestimated it. Even more concerning, all LLMs were more tolerant of ableism when it was expressed in Hindi and asserted Western framings of ableist harm. In contrast, Indian PwD interpreted harm through intention, relationality, and resilience--emphasizing a desire to inform and educate perpetrators. This work provides groundwork for global, inclusive standards of ableism, demonstrating the need to center local disability experiences in the design and evaluation of AI systems."
2507.16182,"We study the societal impact of pseudo-scientific assumptions for predicting the behavior of people in a straightforward application of machine learning to risk prediction in financial lending. This use case also exemplifies the impact of survival bias in loan return prediction. We analyze the models in terms of their accuracy and social cost, showing that the socially optimal model may not imply a significant accuracy loss for this downstream task. Our results are verified for commonly used learning methods and datasets. Our findings also show that there is a natural dynamic when training models that suffer survival bias where accuracy slightly deteriorates, and whose recall and precision improves with time. These results act as an illusion, leading the observer to believe that the system is getting better, when in fact the model is suffering from increasingly more unfairness and survival bias."
2507.16185,"The recent rise in youth suicide highlights the urgent need to understand how online experiences contribute to this public health issue. Our mixed-methods approach responds to this challenge by developing a set of themes focused on risk factors for suicide mortality in online spaces among youth ages 10-24, and a framework to model these themes at scale. Using 29,124 open text summaries of death investigations between 2013-2022, we conducted a thematic analysis to identify 12 types of online activities that were considered by investigators or next of kin to be relevant in contextualizing a given suicide death. We then develop a zero-shot learning framework to model these 12 themes at scale, and analyze variation in these themes by decedent characteristics and over time. Our work uncovers several online activities related to harm to self, harm to others, interpersonal interactions, activity levels online, and life events, which correspond to different phases of suicide risk from two prominent suicide theories. We find an association between these themes and decedent characteristics like age, means of death, and interpersonal problems, and many themes became more prevalent during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns. While digital spaces have taken some steps to address expressions of suicidality online, our work illustrates the opportunities for developing interventions related to less explicit indicators of suicide risk by combining suicide theories with computational research."
2507.16247,"Early large-scale audio datasets, such as LibriSpeech, were built with hundreds of individual contributors whose voices were instrumental in the development of speech technologies, including audiobooks and voice assistants. Yet, a decade later, these same contributions have exposed voice actors to a range of risks. While existing ethical frameworks emphasize Consent, Credit, and Compensation (C3), they do not adequately address the emergent risks involving vocal identities that are increasingly decoupled from context, authorship, and control. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 20 professional voice actors, this paper reveals how the synthetic replication of voice without enforceable constraints exposes individuals to a range of threats. Beyond reputational harm, such as re-purposing voice data in erotic content, offensive political messaging, and meme culture, we document concerns about accountability breakdowns when their voice is leveraged to clone voices that are deployed in high-stakes scenarios such as financial fraud, misinformation campaigns, or impersonation scams. In such cases, actors face social and legal fallout without recourse, while very few of them have a legal representative or union protection. To make sense of these shifting dynamics, we introduce the PRAC3 framework, an expansion of C3 that foregrounds Privacy, Reputation, Accountability, Consent, Credit, and Compensation as interdependent pillars of data used in the synthetic voice economy. This framework captures how privacy risks are amplified through non-consensual training, how reputational harm arises from decontextualized deployment, and how accountability can be reimagined AI Data ecosystems. We argue that voice, as both a biometric identifier and creative labor, demands governance models that restore creator agency, ensure traceability, and establish enforceable boundaries for ethical reuse."
2507.1643,"In this paper, I examine the ethical and anthropological challenges posed by AI-driven recommender systems (RSs), which have become central to shaping digital environments and social interactions. By curating personalized content, RSs do not merely reflect user preferences but actively construct individual experiences across social media, entertainment platforms, and e-commerce. Despite their ubiquity, the ethical implications of RSs remain insufficiently explored, even as concerns over privacy, autonomy, and mental well-being intensify. I argue that existing ethical approaches, including algorethics, the effort to embed ethical principles into algorithmic design, are necessary but ultimately inadequate. RSs inherently reduce human complexity to quantifiable dimensions, exploit user vulnerabilities, and prioritize engagement over well-being. Addressing these concerns requires moving beyond purely technical solutions. I propose a comprehensive framework for human-centered RS design, integrating interdisciplinary perspectives, regulatory strategies, and educational initiatives to ensure AI systems foster rather than undermine human autonomy and societal flourishing."
2507.1702,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has received unprecedented attention in recent years, raising ethical concerns about the development and use of AI technology. In the present article, we advocate that these concerns stem from a blurred understanding of AI, how it can be used, and how it has been interpreted in society. We explore the concept of AI based on three descriptive facets and consider ethical issues related to each facet. Finally, we propose a framework for the ethical assessment of the use of AI."
2507.17481,"Artificial intelligence has deeply permeated numerous fields, especially the design area which relies on technology as a tool for innovation. This change naturally extends to the field of design education, which is closest to design practice. This has led to further exploration of the impact of AI on college-level education in the design discipline. This study aims to examine how current design educators perceive the role of AI in college-level design education, their perspectives on integrating AI into teaching and research, and their concerns regarding its potential challenges in design education and research. Through qualitative, semi-structured, in-depth interviews with seven faculties in U.S. design colleges, the findings reveal that AI, as a tool and source of information, has become an integral part of design education. AI- derived functionalities are increasingly utilized in design software, and educators are actively incorporating AI as a theoretical framework in their teaching. Educators can guide students in using AI tools, but only if they first acquire a strong foundation in basic design principles and skills. This study also indicates the importance of promoting a cooperative relationship between design educators and AI. At the same time, educators express anticipation for advancements in ethical standards, authenticity, and the resolution of copyright issues related to AI."
2507.17758,"This paper explores the integration of generative AI into the fashion design process. Drawing on insights from the January 2025 seminar ``Tisser le futur,'' it investigates how AI reshapes creative workflows, from ideation to prototyping, while interrogating the ethical, aesthetic, and labor implications. The paper highlights co-creative dynamics between humans and machines, the potential for aesthetic innovation, and the environmental and cultural challenges of algorithmic design."
2507.1776,"Supporting students in developing effective diagnostic reasoning is a key challenge in various educational domains. Novices often struggle with cognitive biases such as premature closure and over-reliance on heuristics. Scenario-based learning (SBL) can address these challenges by offering realistic case experiences and iterative practice, but the optimal sequencing of instruction and problem-solving activities remains unclear. This study examines how personalized support can be incorporated into different instructional sequences and whether providing explicit diagnostic strategy instruction before (I-PS) or after problem-solving (PS-I) improves learning and its transfer. We employ a between-groups design in an online SBL environment called PharmaSim, which simulates real-world client interactions for pharmacy technician apprentices. Results indicate that while both instruction types are beneficial, PS-I leads to significantly higher performance in transfer tasks."
2507.18253,"Of growing concern in privacy scholarship is artificial intelligence (AI), as a powerful producer of inferences. Taken to its limits, AI may be presumed capable of inferring ""everything from everything,"" thereby making untenable any normative scheme, including privacy theory and privacy regulation, which rests on protecting privacy based on categories of data - sensitive versus non-sensitive, private versus public. Discarding data categories as a normative anchoring in privacy and data protection as a result of an unconditional acceptance of AI's inferential capacities is what we call privacy nihilism. An ethically reasoned response to AI inferences requires a sober consideration of AI capabilities rather than issuing an epistemic carte blanche. We introduce the notion of conceptual overfitting to expose how privacy nihilism turns a blind eye toward flawed epistemic practices in AI development. Conceptual overfitting refers to the adoption of norms of convenience that simplify the development of AI models by forcing complex constructs to fit data that are conceptually under-representative or even irrelevant. While conceptual overfitting serves as a helpful device to counter normative suggestions grounded in hyperbolic AI capability claims, AI inferences shake any privacy regulation that hinges protections based on restrictions around data categories. We propose moving away from privacy frameworks that focus solely on data type, neglecting all other factors. Theories like contextual integrity evaluate the normative value of privacy across several parameters, including the type of data, the actors involved in sharing it, and the purposes for which the information is used."
2507.18326,"Efficient scalability of automated driving (AD) is key to reducing costs, enhancing safety, conserving resources, and maximizing impact. However, research focuses on specific vehicles and context, while broad deployment requires scalability across various configurations and environments. Differences in vehicle types, sensors, actuators, but also traffic regulations, legal requirements, cultural dynamics, or even ethical paradigms demand high flexibility of data-driven developed capabilities. In this paper, we address the challenge of scalable adaptation of generic capabilities to desired systems and environments. Our concept follows a two-stage fine-tuning process. In the first stage, fine-tuning to the specific environment takes place through a country-specific reward model that serves as an interface between technological adaptations and socio-political requirements. In the second stage, vehicle-specific transfer learning facilitates system adaptation and governs the validation of design decisions. In sum, our concept offers a data-driven process that integrates both technological and socio-political aspects, enabling effective scalability across technical, legal, cultural, and ethical differences."
2507.18431,"City council meetings are vital sites for civic participation where the public can speak directly to their local government. By addressing city officials and calling on them to take action, public commenters can potentially influence policy decisions spanning a broad range of concerns, from housing, to sustainability, to social justice. Yet studies of these meetings have often been limited by the availability of large-scale, geographically-diverse data. Relying on local governments' increasing use of YouTube and other technologies to archive their public meetings, we propose a framework that characterizes comments along two dimensions: the local concerns where concerns are situated (e.g., housing, election administration), and the societal concerns raised (e.g., functional democracy, anti-racism). Based on a large record of public comments we collect from 15 cities in Michigan, we produce data-driven taxonomies of the local concerns and societal concerns that these comments cover, and employ machine learning methods to scalably apply our taxonomies across the entire dataset. We then demonstrate how our framework allows us to examine the salient local concerns and societal concerns that arise in our data, as well as how these aspects interact."
2507.18842,"Ear disease contributes significantly to global hearing loss, with recurrent otitis media being a primary preventable cause in children, impacting development. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise for early diagnosis via otoscopic image analysis, but dataset biases and inconsistencies limit model generalizability and reliability. This retrospective study systematically evaluated three public otoscopic image datasets (Chile; Ohio, USA; Türkiye) using quantitative and qualitative methods. Two counterfactual experiments were performed: (1) obscuring clinically relevant features to assess model reliance on non-clinical artifacts, and (2) evaluating the impact of hue, saturation, and value on diagnostic outcomes. Quantitative analysis revealed significant biases in the Chile and Ohio, USA datasets. Counterfactual Experiment I found high internal performance (AUC > 0.90) but poor external generalization, because of dataset-specific artifacts. The Türkiye dataset had fewer biases, with AUC decreasing from 0.86 to 0.65 as masking increased, suggesting higher reliance on clinically meaningful features. Counterfactual Experiment II identified common artifacts in the Chile and Ohio, USA datasets. A logistic regression model trained on clinically irrelevant features from the Chile dataset achieved high internal (AUC = 0.89) and external (Ohio, USA: AUC = 0.87) performance. Qualitative analysis identified redundancy in all the datasets and stylistic biases in the Ohio, USA dataset that correlated with clinical outcomes. In summary, dataset biases significantly compromise reliability and generalizability of AI-based otoscopic diagnostic models. Addressing these biases through standardized imaging protocols, diverse dataset inclusion, and improved labeling methods is crucial for developing robust AI solutions, improving high-quality healthcare access, and enhancing diagnostic accuracy."
2507.18949,"Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the field of education by enabling personalized learning experiences tailored to individual student needs. In this paper, we introduce a framework for Adaptive Learning Systems that leverages LLM-powered analytics for personalized curriculum design. This innovative approach uses advanced machine learning to analyze real-time data, allowing the system to adapt learning pathways and recommend resources that align with each learner's progress. By continuously assessing students, our framework enhances instructional strategies, ensuring that the materials presented are relevant and engaging. Experimental results indicate a marked improvement in both learner engagement and knowledge retention when using a customized curriculum. Evaluations conducted across varied educational environments demonstrate the framework's flexibility and positive influence on learning outcomes, potentially reshaping conventional educational practices into a more adaptive and student-centered model."
2507.1907,"Research on digital degrowth predominantly critiques digital expansion or presents alternative digital practices. Yet, analyzing the link between digital technologies and complexity is crucial to overcome systemic obstacles hindering digital de-escalation. This article presents the different types of links between complexity and computing observed in the literature: the infrastructural complexity inherent in digital technologies, the socio-political complexity induced by them, and finally, the ontological complexity (individual's ways of relating to their environment) hindered by digitization. The paper explores these links to identify ways to reduce infrastructural and socio-political complexities, and to move away from the reductionist paradigm, in order to support digital degrowth. Its development shows that complexity induces ratchet effects (i.e. irreversibilities in the development of a technique in a society), rendering degrowth efforts difficult to handle by individuals. Therefore, strategies to overcome these barriers are proposed, suggesting that bottom-up simplification approaches stand a greater chance of making alternatives emerge from different stakeholders (including users). This digital shift assumes the development of methods and technical tools that enable individuals to disengage from their attachments to digital habits and infrastructure, opening a substantial field of study."
2507.19078,"The digitalization of societies raises questions about its sustainability and the socio-technical impacts it generates. Ecological redirection applied to organizations is a field of research aiming for achieving sustainability as a direction, rather than for technical means. Arbitration and renunciation to some digital usage and technologies are investigated. Ecological redirection is, however, not yet addressing concrete methodologies for its implementation in organizations. This paper therefore proposes a protocol to support stakeholders in the ecological redirection of their digital practices. This protocol is based on mapping attachments to digital tools through a multi-disciplinary survey. It then proposes increasing stakeholders' knowledge and skills to prepare a debate on the arbitration of renunciations, and finally, to operationalize the closure/transformation of targeted digital practices. This protocol will be tested in real conditions in different contexts. An empirical study is proposed to measure 1) the fluidity with which participants carry out the protocol, 2) the effectiveness of the protocol in terms of the redirection objective, 3) the socio-technical barriers to the redirection process. The paper concludes on the potential benefits for organizations to better understand both the barriers related to its ecological redirection and the transformative aim of such protocols. This will help them trigger large and radical policies towards a desirable and sustainable society."
2507.19305,There is widespread confusion among criminal justice practitioners and legal scholars about the use of artificial intelligence in criminal justice. This didactic review is written for readers with little or no background in statistics or computer science. It is not intended to replace more technical treatments. It is intended to supplement them and encourage readers to dig more deeply into topics that strike their fancy.
2507.19487,"People increasingly rely on AI-advice when making decisions. At times, such advice can promote selfish behavior. When individuals abide by selfishness-promoting AI advice, how are they perceived and punished? To study this question, we build on theories from social psychology and combine machine-behavior and behavioral economic approaches. In a pre-registered, financially-incentivized experiment, evaluators could punish real decision-makers who (i) received AI, human, or no advice. The advice (ii) encouraged selfish or prosocial behavior, and decision-makers (iii) behaved selfishly or, in a control condition, behaved prosocially. Evaluators further assigned responsibility to decision-makers and their advisors. Results revealed that (i) prosocial behavior was punished very little, whereas selfish behavior was punished much more. Focusing on selfish behavior, (ii) compared to receiving no advice, selfish behavior was penalized more harshly after prosocial advice and more leniently after selfish advice. Lastly, (iii) whereas selfish decision-makers were seen as more responsible when they followed AI compared to human advice, punishment between the two advice sources did not vary. Overall, behavior and advice content shape punishment, whereas the advice source does not."
2507.19499,"The NSF Summer Institute in Japan program sends about 60 graduate students of all disciplines to Japan each summer. For two months, students participate in research at host labs, visit conferences and other labs of interest, and receive Japanese language and cultural instruction. Full financial support is provided by the American and Japanese governments. During the summer of 1993, the author participated in this program and took the opportunity to visit the Japanese virtual reality research community. He attended two virtual reality conferences and toured more than a dozen labs. After the program, he made short visits to VR and graphics labs in PR China and South Korea. This paper gives a detailed account of these experiences."
2507.19544,"This paper presents a novel method for transforming large-scale historical expressway route search records into a three-dimensional (3D) Origin-Destination (OD) map, enabling data compression, efficient spatiotemporal sampling and statistical analysis. The study analyzed over 380 million expressway route search logs to investigate online search behavior related to tourist destinations. Several expressway interchanges (ICs) near popular attractions, such as those associated with spring flower viewing, autumn foliage and winter skiing, are examined and visualized. The results reveal strong correlations between search volume trends and the duration of peak tourism seasons. This approach leverages cyberspace behavioral data as a leading indicator of physical movement, providing a proactive tool for traffic management and tourism planning."
2507.19548,"The AI alignment problem comprises both technical and normative dimensions. While technical solutions focus on implementing normative constraints in AI systems, the normative problem concerns determining what these constraints should be. This paper examines justifications for democratic approaches to the normative problem -- where affected stakeholders determine AI alignment -- as opposed to epistocratic approaches that defer to normative experts. We analyze both instrumental justifications (democratic approaches produce better outcomes) and non-instrumental justifications (democratic approaches prevent illegitimate authority or coercion). We argue that normative and metanormative uncertainty create a justificatory gap that democratic approaches aim to fill through political rather than theoretical justification. However, we identify significant challenges for democratic approaches, particularly regarding the prevention of illegitimate coercion through AI alignment. Our analysis suggests that neither purely epistocratic nor purely democratic approaches may be sufficient on their own, pointing toward hybrid frameworks that combine expert judgment with participatory input alongside institutional safeguards against AI monopolization."
2507.19551,"Hateful memes aimed at LGBTQ\,+ communities often evade detection by tweaking either the caption, the image, or both. We build the first robustness benchmark for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted, lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger defences."
2507.19556,"The undergraduate thesis (UGTE) plays an indispensable role in assessing a student's cumulative academic development throughout their college years. Although large language models (LLMs) have advanced education intelligence, they typically focus on holistic assessment with only one single evaluation score, but ignore the intricate nuances across multifaceted criteria, limiting their ability to reflect structural criteria, pedagogical objectives, and diverse academic competencies. Meanwhile, pedagogical theories have long informed manual UGTE evaluation through multi-dimensional assessment of cognitive development, disciplinary thinking, and academic performance, yet remain underutilized in automated settings. Motivated by the research gap, we pioneer PEMUTA, a pedagogically-enriched framework that effectively activates domain-specific knowledge from LLMs for multi-granular UGTE assessment. Guided by Vygotsky's theory and Bloom's Taxonomy, PEMUTA incorporates a hierarchical prompting scheme that evaluates UGTEs across six fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Logic, Originality, Writing, Proficiency, and Rigor (SLOWPR), followed by holistic synthesis. Two in-context learning techniques, \ie, few-shot prompting and role-play prompting, are also incorporated to further enhance alignment with expert judgments without fine-tuning. We curate a dataset of authentic UGTEs with expert-provided SLOWPR-aligned annotations to support multi-granular UGTE assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PEMUTA achieves strong alignment with expert evaluations, and exhibits strong potential for fine-grained, pedagogically-informed UGTE evaluations."
2507.19559,"The growth of machine learning (ML) models and associated datasets triggers a consequent dramatic increase in energy costs for the use and training of these models. In the current context of environmental awareness and global sustainability concerns involving ICT, Green AI is becoming an important research topic. Initiatives like the AI Energy Score Ratings are a good example. Nevertheless, these benchmarking attempts are still to be integrated with existing work on Quality Models and Service-Level Agreements common in other, more mature, ICT subfields. This limits the (automatic) analysis of this model energy descriptions and their use in (semi)automatic model comparison, selection, and certification processes. We aim to leverage the concept of quality models and merge it with existing ML model reporting initiatives and Green/Frugal AI proposals to formalize a Sustainable Quality Model for AI/ML models. As a first step, we propose a new Domain-Specific Language to precisely define the sustainability aspects of an ML model (including the energy costs for its different tasks). This information can then be exported as an extended version of the well-known Model Cards initiative while, at the same time, being formal enough to be input of any other model description automatic process."
2507.19567,"The medical ecosystem consists of the training of new clinicians and researchers, the practice of clinical medicine, and areas of adjacent research. There are many aspects of these domains that could benefit from the application of task automation and programmatic assistance. Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, including large language models (LLMs), have been promised to deliver on healthcare innovation, improving care speed and accuracy, and reducing the burden on staff for manual interventions. However, LLMs have no understanding of objective truth that is based in reality. They also represent real risks to the disclosure of protected information when used by clinicians and researchers. The use of AI in medicine in general, and the deployment of LLMs in particular, therefore requires careful consideration and thoughtful application to reap the benefits of these technologies while avoiding the dangers in each context."
2507.19568,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked immense interest in drug discovery, but most current approaches only digitize existing high-throughput experiments. They remain constrained by conventional pipelines. As a result, they do not address the fundamental challenges of predicting drug effects in humans. Similarly, biomedical digital twins, largely grounded in real-world data and mechanistic models, are tailored for late-phase drug development and lack the resolution to model molecular interactions or their systemic consequences, limiting their impact in early-stage discovery. This disconnect between early discovery and late development is one of the main drivers of high failure rates in drug discovery. The true promise of AI lies not in augmenting current experiments but in enabling virtual experiments that are impossible in the real world: testing novel compounds directly in silico in the human body. Recent advances in AI, high-throughput perturbation assays, and single-cell and spatial omics across species now make it possible to construct programmable virtual humans: dynamic, multiscale models that simulate drug actions from molecular to phenotypic levels. By bridging the translational gap, programmable virtual humans offer a transformative path to optimize therapeutic efficacy and safety earlier than ever before. This perspective introduces the concept of programmable virtual humans, explores their roles in a new paradigm of drug discovery centered on human physiology, and outlines key opportunities, challenges, and roadmaps for their realization."
2507.19643,"Understanding clients' thoughts and beliefs is fundamental in counseling, yet current evaluations of LLM therapists often fail to assess this ability. Existing evaluation methods rely on client simulators that clearly disclose internal states to the therapist, making it difficult to determine whether an LLM therapist can uncover unexpressed perspectives. To address this limitation, we introduce MindVoyager, a novel evaluation framework featuring a controllable and realistic client simulator which dynamically adapts itself based on the ongoing counseling session, offering a more realistic and challenging evaluation environment. We further introduce evaluation metrics that assess the exploration ability of LLM therapists by measuring their thorough understanding of client's beliefs and thoughts."
2507.19692,"In the virtual realm, individuals with photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) encounter challenges when using devices, resulting in exposure to unpredictable seizure-causing visual stimuli. The current norm for preventing epileptic flashes in media is to detect asynchronously when a flash will occur in a video, then notifying the user. However, there is a lack of a real-time and computationally efficient solution for dealing with this issue. To address this issue and enhance accessibility for photosensitive viewers, FlashGuard, a novel approach, was devised to assess the rate of change of colors in frames across the user's screen and appropriately mitigate stimuli, based on perceptually aligned color space analysis in the CIELAB color space. The detection system is built on analyzing differences in color, and the mitigation system works by reducing luminance and smoothing color transitions. This study provides novel insight into how intrinsic color properties contribute to perceptual differences in flashing for PSE individuals, calling for the adoption of broadened WCAG guidelines to better account for risk. These insights and implementations pave the way for stronger protections for individuals with PSE from dangerous triggers in digital media, both in policy and in software."
2507.19877,"Generative AI is not just a technological leap -- it is a societal stress test, reshaping trust, identity, equity, and authorship. This exploratory PhD seminar examined emerging academic trends in AI-driven synthetic media and worlds, emphasizing ethical risks and societal implications. In Part One, students explored core concepts such as generative AI, fake media, and synthetic knowledge production. In Part Two, they critically engaged with these challenges, producing actionable insights. The two-part format enabled deep reflection on power, responsibility, and education in AI-augmented communication. Outcomes offer practical guidance for educators, researchers, and institutions committed to fostering more responsible, human-centered AI use in media and society."
2507.20018,"Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and BERT have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), yet their environmental costs remain dangerously overlooked. This article critiques the sustainability of LLMs, quantifying their carbon footprint, water usage, and contribution to e-waste through case studies of models such as GPT-4 and energy-efficient alternatives like Mistral 7B. Training a single LLM can emit carbon dioxide equivalent to hundreds of cars driven annually, while data centre cooling exacerbates water scarcity in vulnerable regions. Systemic challenges corporate greenwashing, redundant model development, and regulatory voids perpetuate harm, disproportionately burdening marginalized communities in the Global South. However, pathways exist for sustainable NLP: technical innovations (e.g., model pruning, quantum computing), policy reforms (carbon taxes, mandatory emissions reporting), and cultural shifts prioritizing necessity over novelty. By analysing industry leaders (Google, Microsoft) and laggards (Amazon), this work underscores the urgency of ethical accountability and global cooperation. Without immediate action, AIs ecological toll risks outpacing its societal benefits. The article concludes with a call to align technological progress with planetary boundaries, advocating for equitable, transparent, and regenerative AI systems that prioritize both human and environmental well-being."
2507.20346,"Ocular disease affects billions of individuals unevenly worldwide. It continues to increase in prevalence with trends of growing populations of diabetic people, increasing life expectancies, decreasing ophthalmologist availability, and rising costs of care. We present EyeAI, a system designed to provide artificial intelligence-assisted detection of ocular diseases, thereby enhancing global health. EyeAI utilizes a convolutional neural network model trained on 1,920 retinal fundus images to automatically diagnose the presence of ocular disease based on a retinal fundus image input through a publicly accessible web-based application. EyeAI performs a binary classification to determine the presence of any of 45 distinct ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, media haze, and optic disc cupping, with an accuracy of 80%, an AUROC of 0.698, and an F1-score of 0.8876. EyeAI addresses barriers to traditional ophthalmologic care by facilitating low-cost, remote, and real-time diagnoses, particularly for equitable access to care in underserved areas and for supporting physicians through a secondary diagnostic opinion. Results demonstrate the potential of EyeAI as a scalable, efficient, and accessible diagnostic tool. Future work will focus on expanding the training dataset to enhance the accuracy of the model further and improve its diagnostic capabilities."
2507.20525,"This paper presents a case study in the use of a large language model to generate a fictional Buddhist ""sutra""', and offers a detailed analysis of the resulting text from a philosophical and literary point of view. The conceptual subtlety, rich imagery, and density of allusion found in the text make it hard to causally dismiss on account of its mechanistic origin. This raises questions about how we, as a society, should come to terms with the potentially unsettling possibility of a technology that encroaches on human meaning-making. We suggest that Buddhist philosophy, by its very nature, is well placed to adapt."
2507.20995,"This paper provides an educational case study regarding our experience in deploying ChatGPT Large Language Models (LLMs) in the Spring 2025 and Fall 2023 offerings of ECE 4320: Power System Analysis and Control at Georgia Tech. As part of course assessments, students were tasked with identifying, explaining, and correcting errors in the ChatGPT outputs corresponding to power factor correction problems. While most students successfully identified the errors in the outputs from the GPT-4 version of ChatGPT used in Fall 2023, students found the errors from the ChatGPT o1 version much more difficult to identify in Spring 2025. As shown in this case study, the role of LLMs in pedagogy, assessment, and learning in power engineering classrooms is an important topic deserving further investigation."
2507.21054,"In the much-celebrated book Deep Medicine, Eric Topol argues that the development of artificial intelligence for health care will lead to a dramatic shift in the culture and practice of medicine. In the next several decades, he suggests, AI will become sophisticated enough that many of the everyday tasks of physicians could be delegated to it. Topol is perhaps the most articulate advocate of the benefits of AI in medicine, but he is hardly alone in spruiking its potential to allow physicians to dedicate more of their time and attention to providing empathetic care for their patients in the future. Unfortunately, several factors suggest a radically different picture for the future of health care. Far from facilitating a return to a time of closer doctor-patient relationships, the use of medical AI seems likely to further erode therapeutic relationships and threaten professional and patient satisfaction."
2507.21055,"Modern news is often comprehensive, weaving together information from diverse domains, including technology, finance, and agriculture. This very comprehensiveness creates a challenge for interpretation, as audiences typically possess specialized knowledge related to their expertise, age, or standpoint. Consequently, a reader might fully understand the financial implications of a story but fail to grasp or even actively misunderstand its legal or technological dimensions, resulting in critical comprehension gaps. In this work, we investigate how to identify these comprehension gaps and provide solutions to improve audiences' understanding of news content, particularly in the aspects of articles outside their primary domains of knowledge. We propose MADES, an agent-based framework designed to simulate societal communication. The framework utilizes diverse agents, each configured to represent a specific occupation or age group. Each agent is equipped with a memory system. These agents are then simulated to discuss the news. This process enables us to monitor and analyze their behavior and cognitive processes. Our findings indicate that the framework can identify confusions and misunderstandings within news content through its iterative discussion process. Based on these accurate identifications, the framework then designs supplementary material. We validated these outcomes using both statistical analysis and human evaluation, and the results show that agents exhibit significantly improved news understanding after receiving this supplementary material."
2507.21057,"This study explores how emotions and sentiments differ in customer reviews of products and services on e-commerce platforms. Unlike earlier research that treats all reviews uniformly, this study distinguishes between reviews of products, typically fulfilling basic, functional needs, and services, which often cater to experiential and emotional desires. The findings reveal clear differences in emotional expression and sentiment between the two. Product reviews frequently focus on practicality, such as functionality, reliability, and value for money, and are generally more neutral or pragmatic in tone. In contrast, service reviews involve stronger emotional engagement, as services often entail personal interactions and subjective experiences. Customers express a broader spectrum of emotions, such as joy, frustration, or disappointment when reviewing services, as identified using advanced machine learning techniques. Cultural background further influences these patterns. Consumers from collectivist cultures, as defined by Hofstede cultural dimensions, often use more moderated and socially considerate language, reflecting an emphasis on group harmony. Conversely, consumers from individualist cultures tend to offer more direct, emotionally intense feedback. Notably, gender appears to have minimal impact on sentiment variation, reinforcing the idea that the nature of the offering (product vs. service) and cultural context are the dominant factors. Theoretically, the study extends Maslow hierarchy of needs and Hofstede cultural framework to the domain of online reviews, proposing a model that explains how these dimensions shape consumer expression. Practically, the insights offer valuable guidance for businesses looking to optimize their marketing and customer engagement strategies by aligning messaging and service design with customer expectations across product types and cultural backgrounds."
2507.21059,"To understand the potential dependency of tertiary students regarding Meta AI in the academic context. This descriptive cross-sectional study surveyed 872 tertiary students from public and private institutions in Luzon, Philippines. Demographic information and perceptions on Meta AI dependency based on existing literature were collected. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data and differences between STEM and non-STEM students were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. The results indicate a nuanced perspective on Meta AI chatbot use among students. While there is general disagreement with heavy reliance on the chatbot for academic tasks, psychological support, and social factors, there is moderate agreement on its technological benefits and academic utility. Students value the Meta AI convenience, availability, and problem-solving assistance, but prefer traditional resources and human interaction for academic and social support. Concerns about dependency risks and impacts on critical thinking are acknowledged, particularly among STEM students, who rely more on chatbots for academic purposes. This suggests that while Meta AI is a valuable resource, its role is complementary rather than transformative in educational contexts, with institutional encouragement and individual preferences influencing usage patterns. Students generally hesitate to rely heavily on meta-AI chatbots. This reflects a preference for traditional resources and independent problem-solving. While students acknowledge AI chatbots academic benefits and technological convenience, concerns about overreliance and its impact on critical thinking persist, particularly among STEM students, who appear more inclined to integrate these tools into their studies."
2507.21062,"University students and working professionals are increasingly encountering generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education and practice, yet their approaches and outcomes differ markedly. This paper proposes an academic study contrasting novice over-reliance on AI with expert augmentation of AI, grounded in two real-world narratives. In one, a university student attempted to outsource learning entirely to AI, eschewing course engagement. In the other, seasoned cybersecurity professionals in the Tradewinds 2025 red/blue team exercise collaboratively employed AI tools to enhance (not replace) their domain expertise. This proposal outlines a comparative research design to investigate how students' perception of AI as a learning replacement versus professionals' use of AI as an expert tool impacts outcomes. Drawing on current literature in educational technology and workplace AI, we examine implications for curriculum design, AI literacy, and assessment reform in higher education. We hypothesize that blind reliance on AI can erode fundamental skills and academic integrity, whereas guided use of AI by knowledgeable users can amplify productivity without sacrificing quality. The paper details methodologies for classroom and workplace data collection, including student and professional surveys, interviews, and performance analyses. Anticipated findings aim to inform responsible AI integration in curricula, balancing innovation with the necessity of domain knowledge. We conclude with recommendations for pedagogical strategies, institutional policies to foster AI literacy, and a call for longitudinal studies tracking how AI usage during university affects professional competencies over time."
2507.21064,"Cybroc is a series of kinetic art installations exploring the recent proliferating populist longevity activism through the satirical cyborgization of broccoli. The artwork augments the symbol of health food-broccoli-with prosthetic limbs to perform so-called longevity-enhancing exercises such as cold plunges, treadmill running, brachiation (arm-swinging), sled pushing, etc.-all simulations of primal human survival tasks reframed as modern fitness routines. Despite its mechanical augmentations, the broccoli's inevitable decay and rotting after exhibiting high-intensity performances prompts reflection on the limits of biological enhancement and the ethics of human enhancement beyond natural capabilities, particularly transhumanist ideals. By juxtaposing a symbolic healthy vegetable with cutting-edge concepts of human enhancement, Cybroc challenges viewers to consider the intersection of nature, technology, and the human quest for extended lifespan in our transhuman era."
2507.21066,"Technology companies have gained unprecedented power and influence in recent years, resembling quasi-nation-states globally. Corporations with trillion-dollar market capitalizations are no longer just providers of digital services; they now wield immense economic power, influence global infrastructure, and significantly impact political and social dynamics. This thesis examines how these corporations have transcended traditional business models, adopting characteristics typically associated with sovereign states. They now enforce regulations, shape public discourse, and influence legal frameworks in various countries. This shift presents unique challenges, including the undermining of democratic governance, the exacerbation of economic inequalities, and the enabling of unregulated data exploitation and privacy violations. The study will examine critical instances of tech companies acting as quasi-governmental bodies and assess the risks associated with unchecked corporate influence in global governance. Ultimately, the thesis aims to propose policy frameworks and regulatory interventions to curb the overreach of tech giants, restoring the balance between democratic institutions and corporate power and ensuring that the digital future aligns with the public good rather than creating Frankenstein-like monsters."
2507.21076,"In 2021, INFORMS, ACM SIGAI, and the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) hosted three workshops to explore synergies between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) to improve decision-making. The workshops aimed to create a unified research vision for AI/OR collaboration, focusing on overcoming cultural differences and maximizing societal impact. The first two workshops addressed technological innovations, applications, and trustworthy AI development, while the final workshop highlighted specific areas for AI/OR integration. Participants discussed ""Challenge Problems"" and strategies for combining AI and OR techniques. This report outlines five key recommendations to enhance AI/OR collaboration: 1) Funding Opportunities, 2) Joint Education, 3) Long-term Research Programs, 4) Aligning Conferences/Journals, and 5) Benchmark Creation."
2507.21082,"Recent AI progress has outpaced expectations, with some experts now predicting AI that matches or exceeds human capabilities in all cognitive areas (AGI) could emerge this decade, potentially posing grave national and global security threats.

2507.21091,"Conversational agents (CAs) based on generative artificial intelligence frequently face challenges ensuring ethical interactions that align with human values. Current value alignment efforts largely rely on top-down approaches, such as technical guidelines or legal value principles. However, these methods tend to be disconnected from the specific contexts in which CAs operate, potentially leading to misalignment with users interests. To address this challenge, we propose a novel, bottom-up approach to value alignment, utilizing the value ontology of the ISO Value-Based Engineering standard for ethical IT design. We analyse 593 ethically sensitive system outputs identified from 16,908 conversational logs of a major European employment service CA to identify core values and instances of value misalignment within real-world interactions. The results revealed nine core values and 32 different value misalignments that negatively impacted users. Our findings provide actionable insights for CA providers seeking to address ethical challenges and achieve more context-sensitive value alignment."
2507.21093,"This qualitative study explores barriers to utilization of digital mental health Intervention (DMHI) among college students. Data are from a large randomized clinical trial of an intervention, eBridge, that used motivational interviewing for online counseling to connect students with mental health issues to professional services. We applied thematic analysis to analyze the feedback from the student participants regarding their experience of using the DMHI platform. We identified nine key barriers to DMHI adoption and the use of in-person mental health services: emotional distress, time constraints, privacy concerns, resource accessibility, financial challenges, medication stigma, dissatisfaction with communication, content clarity, and treatment-related concerns. Our findings emphasize the need for personalized, culturally sensitive interventions and improved strategies to enhance the access and engagement in mental health support for young adults."
2507.211,"This paper introduces TACTIC-GRAPHS, a system that combines spectral graph theory and multimodal graph neural reasoning for semantic understanding and threat detection in tactical video under high noise and weak structure. The framework incorporates spectral embedding, temporal causal edge modeling, and discriminative path inference across heterogeneous modalities. A semantic-aware keyframe extraction method fuses visual, acoustic, and action cues to construct temporal graphs. Using graph attention and Laplacian spectral mapping, the model performs cross-modal weighting and causal signal analysis. Experiments on TACTIC-AVS and TACTIC-Voice datasets show 89.3 percent accuracy in temporal alignment and over 85 percent recognition of complete threat chains, with node latency within plus-minus 150 milliseconds. The approach enhances structural interpretability and supports applications in surveillance, defense, and intelligent security systems."
2507.21102,"Philosophers of technology have recently started paying more attention to the environmental impacts of AI, in particular of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI (genAI) applications. Meanwhile, few developers of AI give concrete estimates of the ecological impact of their models and products, and even when they do so, their analysis is often limited to green house gas emissions of certain stages of AI development or use. The current proposal encourages practically viable analyses of the sustainability aspects of genAI informed by philosophical ideas."
2507.21118,"MOOCs offer free and open access to a wide audience, but completion rates remain low, often due to a lack of personalized content. To address this issue, it is essential to predict learner performance in order to provide tailored feedback. Behavioral traces-such as clicks and events-can be analyzed as time series to anticipate learners' outcomes. This work compares multivariate time series classification methods to identify at-risk learners at different stages of the course (after 5, 10 weeks, etc.). The experimental evaluation, conducted on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD), focuses on three courses: two in STEM and one in SHS. Preliminary results show that the evaluated approaches are promising for predicting learner failure in MOOCs. The analysis also suggests that prediction accuracy is influenced by the amount of recorded interactions, highlighting the importance of rich and diverse behavioral data."
2507.21169,"Exploring the socio-technical challenges confronting the adoption of AI in organisational settings is something that has so far been largely absent from the related literature. In particular, research into requirements for trustworthy AI typically overlooks how people deal with the problems of trust in the tools that they use as part of their everyday work practices. This article presents some findings from an ongoing ethnographic study of how current tools are used in air traffic control work and what it reveals about requirements for trustworthy AI in air traffic control and other safety-critical application domains."

However, location information from mobile networks now enables large-scale, dynamic analyses of how people navigate cities. This study uses eXtended Detail Records (XDRs) derived from mobile phone activity to analyze commuting patterns and accessibility inequalities in Santiago, Chile. First, we identify residential and work locations and model commuting routes using the R5 multimodal routing engine, which combines public transport and walking. To explore spatial patterns, we apply a bivariate spatial clustering analysis (LISA) alongside regression techniques to identify distinct commuting behaviors and their alignment with vulnerable population groups. Our findings reveal that average commuting times remain consistent across socioeconomic groups. However, despite residing in areas with greater opportunity density, higher-income populations do not consistently experience shorter commuting times. This highlights a disconnect between spatial proximity to opportunities and actual travel experience. Our analysis reveals significant disparities between sociodemographic groups, particularly regarding the distribution of indigenous populations and gender. Overall, the findings of our study suggest that commuting and accessibility inequalities in Santiago are closely linked to broader social and demographic structures."
2507.21839,"AGI Racing is the view that it is in the self-interest of major actors in AI development, especially powerful nations, to accelerate their frontier AI development to build highly capable AI, especially artificial general intelligence (AGI), before competitors have a chance. We argue against AGI Racing. First, the downsides of racing to AGI are much higher than portrayed by this view. Racing to AGI would substantially increase catastrophic risks from AI, including nuclear instability, and undermine the prospects of technical AI safety research to be effective. Second, the expected benefits of racing may be lower than proponents of AGI Racing hold. In particular, it is questionable whether winning the race enables complete domination over losers. Third, international cooperation and coordination, and perhaps carefully crafted deterrence measures, constitute viable alternatives to racing to AGI which have much smaller risks and promise to deliver most of the benefits that racing to AGI is supposed to provide. Hence, racing to AGI is not in anyone's self-interest as other actions, particularly incentivizing and seeking international cooperation around AI issues, are preferable."
2507.21842,"Digital regulations such as the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) represent major efforts to shape human-centered and human rights-based frameworks for society. Yet, as these laws are translated into practice, challenges emerge at the intersection of technology, law, and design. This paper presents a qualitative case study examining how designers act as mediators between abstract legal requirements and real-world digital experiences for users, focusing on the design of content reporting mechanisms under Article 16 of the DSA.Through an expert workshop with professional designers from diverse fields (N=9), we explore how legal obligations are interpreted by designers and reflected in discussions and design solutions. Our findings resonate with previous research on the design of reporting mechanisms and dark patterns, highlighting how UX design choices can mislead or hinder users' decision-making and therefore also highlighting the crucial role of design decisions.We show how participatory design methods can bridge disciplinary divides, making legal obligations accessible in compliance fostering design solutions.By using legal design as a lens, we argue that the co-creation of digital regulations and user experience is a core site for digital humanism; where designers, engineers, and legal scholars must collaborate to ensure that systems uphold legal standards to address the challenge the regulation poses to these disciplines."
2507.22161,"Computer science attracts few women, and their proportion decreases through advancing career stages. Few women progress to PhD studies in CS after completing master's studies. Empowering women at this stage in their careers is essential to unlock untapped potential for society, industry and academia. This paper identifies students' career assumptions and information related to PhD studies focused on gender-based differences. We propose a Women Career Lunch program to inform female master students about PhD studies that explains the process, clarifies misconceptions, and alleviates concerns. An extensive survey was conducted to identify factors that encourage and discourage students from undertaking PhD studies. We identified statistically significant differences between those who undertook PhD studies and those who didn't, as well as gender differences. A catalogue of questions to initiate discussions with potential PhD students which allowed them to explore these factors was developed and translated to 8 languages. Encouraging factors toward PhD study include interest and confidence in research arising from a research involvement during earlier studies; enthusiasm for and self-confidence in CS in addition to an interest in an academic career; encouragement from external sources; and a positive perception towards PhD studies which can involve achieving personal goals. Discouraging factors include uncertainty and lack of knowledge of the PhD process, a perception of lower job flexibility, and the requirement for long-term commitment. Gender differences highlighted that female students who pursue a PhD have less confidence in their technical skills than males but a higher preference for interdisciplinary areas. Female students are less inclined than males to perceive the industry as offering better job opportunities and more flexible career paths than academia."
2507.22271,"Online platforms, particularly Wikipedia, have become critical infrastructures for providing diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. This human-curated knowledge now forms the foundation for modern AI. However, we have not yet fully explored how knowledge production capability vary across languages and domains. Here, we address this gap by applying economic complexity analysis to understand the editing history of Wikipedia platforms. This approach allows us to infer the latent mode of ``knowledge-production'' of each language community from the diversity and specialization of its contributed content. We reveal that different language communities exhibit distinct specializations, particularly in cultural subjects. Furthermore, we map the global landscape of these production modes, finding that the structure of knowledge production strongly reflects geopolitical boundaries. Our findings suggest that while a common mode of knowledge production exists for standardized topics such as science, it is more diverse for cultural topics or controversial subjects such as conspiracy theories. The association between differences in knowledge production capability and geopolitical factors implies how linguistic and cultural dynamics shape our worldview and the biases embedded in Wikipedia data, a unique, massive, and essential dataset for modern AI."
2507.22946,"We present SmartCourse, an integrated course management and AI-driven advising system for undergraduate students (specifically tailored to the Computer Science (CPS) major). SmartCourse addresses the limitations of traditional advising tools by integrating transcript and plan information for student-specific context. The system combines a command-line interface (CLI) and a Gradio web GUI for instructors and students, manages user accounts, course enrollment, grading, and four-year degree plans, and integrates a locally hosted large language model (via Ollama) for personalized course recommendations. It leverages transcript and major plan to offer contextual advice (e.g., prioritizing requirements or retakes). We evaluated the system on 25 representative advising queries and introduced custom metrics: PlanScore, PersonalScore, Lift, and Recall to assess recommendation quality across different context conditions. Experiments show that using full context yields substantially more relevant recommendations than context-omitted modes, confirming the necessity of transcript and plan information for personalized academic advising. SmartCourse thus demonstrates how transcript-aware AI can enhance academic planning."
2507.22947,"The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents transformative opportunities for education, generating numerous novel application scenarios. However, significant challenges remain: evaluation metrics vary substantially across different educational scenarios, while many emerging scenarios lack appropriate assessment metrics. Current benchmarks predominantly measure general intelligence rather than pedagogical capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce ELMES, an open-source automated evaluation framework specifically designed for assessing LLMs in educational settings. ELMES features a modular architecture that enables researchers to create dynamic, multi-agent dialogues through simple configuration files, facilitating flexible scenario design without requiring extensive programming expertise. The framework incorporates a hybrid evaluation engine that objectively quantifies traditionally subjective pedagogical metrics using an LLM-as-a-Judge methodology. We conduct systematic benchmarking of state-of-the-art LLMs across four critical educational scenarios: Knowledge Point Explanation, Guided Problem-Solving Teaching, Interdisciplinary Lesson Plan Generation, and Contextualized Question Generation, employing fine-grained metrics developed in collaboration with education specialists. Our results demonstrate distinct capability distributions among models, revealing context-specific strengths and limitations. ELMES provides educators and researchers with an accessible evaluation framework that significantly reduces adaptation barriers for diverse educational applications while advancing the practical implementation of LLMs in pedagogy. The framework is publicly available at \emph{this https URL}."
2507.23434,"In the age of artificial intelligence, architectural practice faces a paradox of immense potential and creeping standardization. As humans are increasingly relying on AI-generated outputs, architecture risks becoming a spectacle of repetition- a shuffling of data that neither truly innovates nor progresses vertically in creative depth. This paper explores the critical role of data in AI systems, scrutinizing the training datasets that form the basis of AI's generative capabilities and the implications for architectural practice. We argue that when architects approach AI passively, without actively engaging their own creative and critical faculties, they risk becoming passive users locked in an endless loop of horizontal expansion without meaningful vertical growth. By examining the epistemology of architecture in the AI age, this paper calls for a paradigm where AI serves as a tool for vertical and horizontal growth, contingent on human creativity and agency. Only by mastering this dynamic relationship can architects avoid the trap of passive, standardized design and unlock the true potential of AI."
2507.23653,"In an era of exponential technological advancement, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in architecture, reshaping traditional design and construction practices. This article explores the multifaceted roles of AI in the architectural process, emphasizing its potential to enhance creativity and efficiency while addressing its limitations in capturing multisensory and experiential dimensions of space. Historically, architectural innovation has paralleled technological progress, from basic tools to advanced computer-aided design systems. However, the integration of AI presents unique challenges, requiring architects to critically evaluate its role in design. A narrative review methodology was adopted, focusing on academic sources selected for their relevance, recency, and credibility. The findings reveal that AI is increasingly integrated across various stages of the architectural process, from early conceptualization and site analysis to generative design and construction detailing. AI tools excel at automating repetitive tasks and generating innovative design solutions, freeing architects to focus on creativity and problem-solving. Additionally, AI's (text- toimage) visual representation strength challenges the ocularcentric approaches in architecture, which should push future architects to address the holistic sensory and experiential qualities of space or the critical thinking inherent to architectural design. While AI offers transformative potential, architects must view it as a collaborative partner rather than a passive tool."
2507.23669,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are transforming critical sectors such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, enhancing operational efficiency and decision-making processes. However, their deployment in high-stakes domains has exposed vulnerabilities that can result in significant societal harm. To systematically study and mitigate these risk, initiatives like the AI Incident Database (AIID) have emerged, cataloging over 3,000 real-world AI failure reports. Currently, associating a new report with the appropriate AI Incident relies on manual expert intervention, limiting scalability and delaying the identification of emerging failure patterns.To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval-based framework that automates the association of new reports with existing AI Incidents through semantic similarity modeling. We formalize the task as a ranking problem, where each report-comprising a title and a full textual description-is compared to previously documented AI Incidents based on embedding cosine similarity. Benchmarking traditional lexical methods, cross-encoder architectures, and transformer-based sentence embedding models, we find that the latter consistently achieve superior performance. Our analysis further shows that combining titles and descriptions yields substantial improvements in ranking accuracy compared to using titles alone. Moreover, retrieval performance remains stable across variations in description length, highlighting the robustness of the framework. Finally, we find that retrieval performance consistently improves as the training set expands. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient solution for supporting the maintenance of the AIID."
2507.23718,"Risk-based approaches to AI governance often center the technological artifact as the primary focus of risk assessments, overlooking systemic risks that emerge from the complex interaction between AI systems and society. One potential source to incorporate more societal context into these approaches is the news media, as it embeds and reflects complex interactions between AI systems, human stakeholders, and the larger society. News media is influential in terms of which AI risks are emphasized and discussed in the public sphere, and thus which risks are deemed important. Yet, variations in the news media between countries and across different value systems (e.g. political orientations) may differentially shape the prioritization of risks through the media's agenda setting and framing processes. To better understand these variations, this work presents a comparative analysis of a cross-national sample of news media spanning 6 countries (the U.S., the U.K., India, Australia, Israel, and South Africa). Our findings show that AI risks are prioritized differently across nations and shed light on how left vs. right leaning U.S. based outlets not only differ in the prioritization of AI risks in their coverage, but also use politicized language in the reporting of these risks. These findings can inform risk assessors and policy-makers about the nuances they should account for when considering news media as a supplementary source for risk-based governance approaches."
2508.00149,"Large-scale human mobility datasets play increasingly critical roles in many algorithmic systems, business processes and policy decisions. Unfortunately there has been little focus on understanding bias and other fundamental shortcomings of the datasets and how they impact downstream analyses and prediction tasks. In this work, we study `data production', quantifying not only whether individuals are represented in big digital datasets, but also how they are represented in terms of how much data they produce. We study GPS mobility data collected from anonymized smartphones for ten major US cities and find that data points can be more unequally distributed between users than wealth. We build models to predict the number of data points we can expect to be produced by the composition of demographic groups living in census tracts, and find strong effects of wealth, ethnicity, and education on data production. While we find that bias is a universal phenomenon, occurring in all cities, we further find that each city suffers from its own manifestation of it, and that location-specific models are required to model bias for each city. This work raises serious questions about general approaches to debias human mobility data and urges further research."
2508.00153,"Green computing represents a critical pathway to decarbonize the digital economy while maintaining technological progress. This article examines how sustainable IT strategies including energy-efficient hardware, AI-optimized data centres, and circular e-waste systems can transform computing into a net carbon sink. Through analysis of industry best practices and emerging technologies like quantum computing and biodegradable electronics, we demonstrate achievable reductions of 40-60% in energy consumption without compromising performance. The study highlights three key findings: (1) current solutions already deliver both environmental and economic benefits, with typical payback periods of 3-5 years; (2) systemic barriers including cost premiums and policy fragmentation require coordinated action; and (3) next-generation innovations promise order-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency. We present a practical framework for stakeholders from corporations adopting renewable-powered cloud services to individuals extending device lifespans to accelerate the transition. The research underscores computing's unique potential as a climate solution through its rapid innovation cycles and measurable impacts, concluding that strategic investments in green IT today can yield disproportionate sustainability dividends across all sectors tomorrow. This work provides both a compelling case for urgent action and a clear roadmap to realize computing's potential as a powerful carbon destruction tool in the climate crisis era."
2508.00485,"We are experiencing the rise of ChatGPT-like systems or LLMs in political turbulent times. We assume the need to regulate their use because of their bubble-shaping and polarizing potential. To regulate, we need a language that allows interests and compromises to be discussed. In this context, we can think of such a shared language as a jargon, a specialized vocabulary for law-making. To the extent that such a jargon exists, it is now being corrupted by LLMs. This situation appears paradoxical. The issue includes persistent communication failures, between disciplines that cannot translate their technical vocabulary into accessible terms, and between political movements that operate in incompatible worldviews. We show that a frame integrating four specialist languages, those of governance, economy, community and science, is able to address these failures case-wise, which we consider helpful. However, for reasons noted, we cannot create the more generic jargon needed on our own. We conclude that our frame provides the knowledge to design and apply RAG-LLM architectures for researching their jargon generating potential in a future project. We show its feasibility in the appendix."
2508.00536,"This report presents findings from an expert survey on digital minds takeoff scenarios. The survey was conducted in early 2025 with 67 experts in digital minds research, AI research, philosophy, forecasting, and related fields. Participants provided probabilistic forecasts and qualitative reasoning on the development, characteristics, and societal impact of digital minds, that is, computer systems capable of subjective experience. Experts assigned high probability to digital minds being possible in principle (median 90%) and being created this century (65% by 2100), with a non-negligible probability of emergence by 2030 (20%). Many anticipated rapid growth in digital mind welfare capacity, with collective welfare capacity potentially matching that of billions of humans within a decade after the creation of the first digital mind. Participants also expected widespread claims from digital minds regarding their consciousness and rights, and predicted substantial societal disagreement over their existence and moral interests. Views diverged on whether digital mind welfare will be net positive or negative. These findings provide evidence that bears on the extent to which preparing the world for the potential arrival of digital minds should be a priority across domains such as research and governance. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously in light of the potential for systematic overrepresentation of experts who deem digital minds particularly likely or important."
2508.00543,"Additional automation being build into ships implies a shift of crew from ship to shore. However, automated ships still have to be monitored and, in some situations, controlled remotely. These tasks are carried out by human operators located in shore-based remote operation centers. In this work, we present a concept for a hazard database that supports the safeguarding and certification of such remote operation centers. The concept is based on a categorization of hazard sources which we derive from a generic functional architecture. A subsequent preliminary suitability analysis unveils which methods for hazard analysis and risk assessment can adequately fill this hazard database."
2508.00849,"The preservation of cultural heritage faces growing challenges from climate change, tourism pressure, and limited conservation resources. Existing monitoring solutions are often cost-prohibitive, proprietary, and inflexible, leaving many institutions, particularly in developing regions, without viable tools for proactive management. This study presents a modular, low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) system designed for real-time environmental and behavioural monitoring in heritage sites. Built with off-the-shelf components such as ESP32 microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi, the system integrates a wireless sensor network, edge computing, and cloud services (Microsoft Azure) to measure variables including temperature, humidity, sound, and visitor proximity. It also incorporates computer vision models to classify visitor behaviour, achieving up to 95% accuracy using fine-tuned Vision Transformers. The system's modularity, enabled via JSON configurations, allows for rapid reconfiguration without firmware changes. A simulated deployment demonstrated robust performance, low power consumption, and cost-efficiency (less than 200 GBP per node), validating the system's potential for scalable, sustainable heritage monitoring. This open-source framework offers a practical path forward for institutions seeking to balance accessibility with conservation needs."
2508.00857,"This paper introduces UrbanScore - a real-time web platform that computes a personalised liveability score for any urban address. The system fuses five data streams: (i) address geocoding via Nominatim, (ii) facility extraction from OpenStreetMap through Overpass QL, (iii) segment-level traffic metrics from TomTom Flow v10, (iv) hourly air-quality readings from OpenWeatherMap, and (v) user-declared preference profiles, all persisted in an Oracle 19c relational store. Six sub-scores (air, traffic, lifestyle, education, metro access, surface transport) are derived, adaptively weighted and combined; an OpenAI large-language model then converts the numeric results into concise, user-friendly explanations. A pilot deployment covering the 226 km2 metropolitan area of Bucharest evaluated 3,450 unique addresses over four weeks. Median end-to-end latency was 2.1 s (p95 = 2.9s), meeting the <3 non-functional requirement. Aggregate scores ranged from 34 to 92 (mean 68, SD 11), with high-scoring clusters along metro corridors that pair abundant green space with PM2.5 levels below 35 ug m-3. A detailed case study of the Tineretului district produced an overall score of 91/100 and demonstrated how the narrative layer guides users toward comparable neighbourhoods. Limitations include dependence on third-party API uptime, spatial bias toward well-mapped OSM regions and the absence of noise and crime layers, cited by 18% of survey participants as a desired enhancement. Overall, the results show that open geodata, commercial mobility feeds and conversational AI can be integrated into a performant, explainable decision-support tool that places ""liveability analytics"" in the hands of every house-hunter, commuter and city planner."
2508.00868,"This dissertation presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of artificial intelligence governance frameworks across the European Union, United States, China, and IEEE technical standards, examining how different jurisdictions and organizations approach the challenge of promoting responsible and beneficial AI development.

2508.00873,"Fairness remains a critical concern in healthcare, where unequal access to services and treatment outcomes can adversely affect patient health. While Federated Learning (FL) presents a collaborative and privacy-preserving approach to model training, ensuring fairness is challenging due to heterogeneous data across institutions, and current research primarily addresses non-medical applications. To fill this gap, we establish the first experimental benchmark for fairness in medical FL, evaluating six representative FL methods across diverse demographic attributes and imaging modalities. We introduce FairFedMed, the first medical FL dataset specifically designed to study group fairness (i.e., demographics). It comprises two parts: FairFedMed-Oph, featuring 2D fundus and 3D OCT ophthalmology samples with six demographic attributes; and FairFedMed-Chest, which simulates real cross-institutional FL using subsets of CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR. Together, they support both simulated and real-world FL across diverse medical modalities and demographic groups. Existing FL models often underperform on medical images and overlook fairness across demographic groups. To address this, we propose FairLoRA, a fairness-aware FL framework based on SVD-based low-rank approximation. It customizes singular value matrices per demographic group while sharing singular vectors, ensuring both fairness and efficiency. Experimental results on the FairFedMed dataset demonstrate that FairLoRA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical image classification but also significantly improves fairness across diverse populations. Our code and dataset can be accessible via link:this https URL."
2508.00875,"This document presents a preliminary compilation of general-purpose AI (GPAI) evaluation practices that may promote internal validity, external validity and reproducibility. It includes suggestions for human uplift studies and benchmark evaluations, as well as cross-cutting suggestions that may apply to many different evaluation types. Suggestions are organised across four stages in the evaluation life cycle: design, implementation, execution and documentation. Drawing from established practices in machine learning, statistics, psychology, economics, biology and other fields recognised to have important lessons for AI evaluation, these suggestions seek to contribute to the conversation on the nascent and evolving field of the science of GPAI evaluations. The intended audience of this document includes providers of GPAI models presenting systemic risk (GPAISR), for whom the EU AI Act lays out specific evaluation requirements; third-party evaluators; policymakers assessing the rigour of evaluations; and academic researchers developing or conducting GPAI evaluations."
2508.00878,"This paper revisits the concept of interaction in interactive art, tracing its evolution from sociocultural origins to its narrowing within human-computer paradigms. It critiques this reduction and proposes a relational (re)turn through reclaiming interaction as intersubjective and relational. Through a synthesis of aesthetic theories and case studies from Ars Electronica, the paper introduces Techno Relational Aesthetics, a new conceptual lens that emphasizes technologically mediated relationality. This approach expands interactive art beyond audience-artwork interaction and opens the possibility to broader relational practices."
2508.00883,"Selecting appropriate use cases for implementing digital solutions in small towns is a recurring challenge for smart city projects. This paper presents a transdisciplinary methodology for systematically identifying and evaluating such use cases, drawing from diverse academic disciplines and practical expertise. The proposed methodology was developed and implemented in Lower Austria, with a particular focus on the small towns that are characteristic of a region lacking major urban centres. Through semi-structured interviews and collaborative workshops (e.g. a needs requirements workshop) with various relevant stakeholders, fifteen possible use cases were first identified. Then these use cases were categorised and assessed based on criteria such as feasibility, usefulness, the need for biological or human modelling, and overall complexity. Based on these characteristics, three use cases were selected for further development. These will be the basis of digital twin solutions for supporting decision-making and public outreach regarding policy decisions in those fields. Our proposed methodology emphasises stakeholder engagement to ensure robust data collection and alignment with practical requirements and the involved towns' current needs. We thus provide a replicable framework for researchers and practitioners aiming to implement digital twin tools in future smart city initiatives in non-urban and rural contexts."
2508.00906,"This study explores the role of gamification in enhancing academic library services in India by surveying library leaders across various institutions. Using game-like elements in non-game contexts, gamification can boost user engagement and improve services such as information literacy and research consultations. Findings reveal moderate awareness and generally positive perceptions of gamification's effectiveness. However, challenges like insufficient staff expertise, infrastructure, and limited funding hinder implementation. The study emphasises the need for additional resources, including staff training and technological upgrades, to unlock the full potential of gamification in academic libraries."
2508.00908,"Already before the enactment of the EU AI Act, candidate or job recommendation for algorithmic hiring -- semi-automatically matching CVs to job postings -- was used as an example of a high-risk application where unfair treatment could result in serious harms to job seekers. Recommending candidates to jobs or jobs to candidates, however, is also a fitting example of a multi-stakeholder recommendation problem. In such multi-stakeholder systems, the end user is not the only party whose interests should be considered when generating recommendations. In addition to job seekers, other stakeholders -- such as recruiters, organizations behind the job postings, and the recruitment agency itself -- are also stakeholders in this and deserve to have their perspectives included in the design of relevant fairness metrics. Nevertheless, past analyses of fairness in algorithmic hiring have been restricted to single-side fairness, ignoring the perspectives of the other stakeholders. In this paper, we address this gap and present a multi-stakeholder approach to fairness in a candidate recommender system that recommends relevant candidate CVs to human recruiters in a human-in-the-loop algorithmic hiring scenario. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 40 different stakeholders (job seekers, companies, recruiters, and other job portal employees). We used these interviews to explore their lived experiences of unfairness in hiring, co-design definitions of fairness as well as metrics that might capture these experiences. Finally, we attempt to reconcile and map these different (and sometimes conflicting) perspectives and definitions to existing (categories of) fairness metrics that are relevant for our candidate recommendation scenario."
2508.00911,"In the context of the high energy demand of large language models (LLMs) and growing concerns about global warming, there is significant demand for actionable recommendations that can help reduce emissions when utilizing such technologies. This paper examines the environmental impact linked to a fundamental function of LLM-based conversational systems that might be less well known to end users: the conversational memory, which enables the system to maintain context throughout the dialog. After analyzing conversation patterns using anonymized token data from a real world system, a recommendation for individuals on how they could use chatbots in a more sustainable way is derived. Based on a simulation, the savings potential resulting from the adoption of such an ecological gesture is estimated."
2508.00919,"Current research efforts largely focus on employing at most one interpretable method to elucidate machine learning (ML) model performance. However, significant barriers remain in translating these interpretability techniques into actionable insights for clinicians, notably due to complexities such as variability across clinical settings and the Rashomon effect. In this study, we developed and rigorously evaluated two ML models along with interpretation mechanisms, utilizing data from 131,051 ICU admissions across 208 hospitals in the United States, sourced from the eICU Collaborative Research Database. We examined two datasets: one with imputed missing values (130,810 patients, 5.58% ICU mortality) and another excluding patients with missing data (5,661 patients, 23.65% ICU mortality). The random forest (RF) model demonstrated an AUROC of 0.912 with the first dataset and 0.839 with the second dataset, while the XGBoost model achieved an AUROC of 0.924 with the first dataset and 0.834 with the second dataset. Consistently identified predictors of ICU mortality across datasets, cross-validation folds, models, and explanation mechanisms included lactate levels, arterial pH, body temperature, and others. By aligning with routinely collected clinical variables, this study aims to enhance ML model interpretability for clinical use, promote greater understanding and adoption among clinicians, and ultimately contribute to improved patient outcomes."
2508.00925,"In Africa, the scarcity of computational resources and medical datasets remains a major hurdle to the development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in clinical settings, further contributing to global bias. These limitations hinder the full realization of AI's potential and present serious challenges to advancing healthcare across the region.This paper proposes a framework aimed at addressing data scarcity in African healthcare. The framework presents a comprehensive strategy to encourage healthcare providers across the continent to create, curate, and share locally sourced medical imaging datasets. By organizing themed challenges that promote participation, accurate and relevant datasets can be generated within the African healthcare community. This approach seeks to overcome existing dataset limitations, paving the way for a more inclusive and impactful AI ecosystem that is specifically tailored to Africa's healthcare needs."
2508.00932,"Previous literature has proposed that the companies operating data centers enforce government regulations on AI companies. Using a new dataset of 775 non-U.S. data center projects, this paper estimates how often data centers could be subject to foreign legal authorities due to the nationality of the data center operators. We find that U.S. companies operate 48% of all non-U.S. data center projects in our dataset when weighted by investment value - a proxy for compute capacity. This is an approximation based on public data and should be interpreted as an initial estimate. For the United States, our findings suggest that data center operators offer a lever for internationally governing AI that complements traditional export controls, since operators can be used to regulate computing resources already deployed in non-U.S. data centers. For other countries, our results show that building data centers locally does not guarantee digital sovereignty if those facilities are run by foreign entities.To support future research, we release our dataset, which documents over 20 variables relating to each data center, including the year it was announced, the investment value, and its operator's national affiliation. The dataset also includes over 1,000 quotes describing these data centers' strategic motivations, operational challenges, and engagement with U.S. and Chinese entities."
2508.00936,"Digital twin (DT) technology holds immense potential for transforming healthcare systems through real-time monitoring, predictive analysis, and agile interventions to support various decision-making needs. However, its successful implementation depends on addressing a range of complex sociotechnical challenges. Using a case study of provider workload DT, this research investigates DT implementation challenges in healthcare by capturing the perspectives of four distinct stakeholders: family medicine specialists (FMS), organizational psychologists (OP), engineers (EE), and implementation scientists (IS). We conducted semi-structured interviews guided by the updated Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR 2.0), a widely used implementation science framework for understanding factors that influence implementation outcomes. We then mapped each stakeholder group's preferences and concerns, revealing a nuanced landscape of converging and diverging perspectives that highlight both shared and group-specific implementation barriers. Through thematic coding, the 66 identified challenges were categorized into seven domains: data-related, financial and economic, operational, organizational, personnel, regulatory and ethical, and technological. Our findings reveal shared concerns such as data privacy and security, interoperability, and regulatory compliance. However, divergences also emerged, reflecting each group's functional focus. These findings emphasize the need for a multidisciplinary, stakeholder-sensitive approach that addresses both functional and practical concerns, highlighting the importance of tailored implementation strategies to support successful DT adoption in healthcare."
2508.00942,"Over the last twenty years, smartphones gradually replaced many earlier digital tools such as PDAs, cameras and music players. Today these objects are regarded as obsolete: they may hold some esthetic or nostalgic appeal but they do not fit in a modern, zero-friction, cloud-first workflow. Yet these devices still have desirable qualities that smartphones lack: a singular focus on a specific use case; hardware buttons and physical connectors; multi-day battery life. Even their lack of connectivity can be seen as an asset from a resilience, privacy and security standpoint. Actually using decades-old tech today is challenging, in spite of its apparent simplicity, because the friction of physical media-based workflows now feels unacceptable. But much like classic cars can be fitted with an EV motor, it is possible to retrofit older devices in order to make them usable again in a connected world. Long after the manufacturer stops supporting a device, user communities play a crucial role in reverse-engineering file formats and communication protocols, maintaining documentation and software archives, as well as designing and producing spare parts that can even overcome initial design flaws. This paper will explore both software and hardware retrofitting techniques, using various examples: cameras, music players, dedicated writing instruments, video games. The resulting retrofitted devices are neither vintage nor modern, creating their own hybrid interaction paradigm around monotasking on dedicated hardware with intermittent connectivity. The various examples discussed outline some common factors that increase the likelihood that a successful retrofitting path can be found for a device. These factors can also be understood as proven design principles to create resilient hardware."

Vibe coding, which is structured, prompt-driven code generation with large language models (LLMs) embedded in reproducible workflows, offers one pragmatic response. It aims to compress the idea-to-analysis timeline, reduce staffing pressure on specialized data roles, and maintain rigorous, version-controlled outputs. This article defines the vibe coding concept, situates it against the current academic resourcing crisis, details a beginner-friendly toolchain for its implementation, and analyzes inherent limitations that necessitate governance and mindful application."

This study aims to describe the factors associated with the value placed on the teaching career in Peru. A total of 28217 public school teachers were analyzed using data from the 2020 National Teacher Survey. A variable measuring the ""value of the teaching career"" was constructed using eight indicators and categorized as low, medium, or high. Another variable, vision of the future, was classified as pessimistic, conformist, or optimistic. This observational, cross-sectional, and analytical study included variables related to in-service training, working conditions, professional recognition, and sociodemographic characteristics. Among the teachers surveyed, 45.8 % expressed an optimistic outlook on the future of the profession, 48 % held a conformist view, and only 6.2 % reported a pessimistic perspective. A generalized linear model revealed that the value placed on the teaching career was significantly associated with male gender (p = 0.002), a professional career (p < 0.001), an optimistic outlook (p = 0.033), and working at the primary level (p < 0.001). It was concluded that Peruvian teachers predominantly hold conformist or optimistic views of their profession. This highlights the need to reinforce merit-based advancement, competency-based training, intrinsic motivation, and ongoing professional development"
2508.0097,"This study introduces the AI-Educational Development Loop (AI-EDL), a theory-driven framework that integrates classical learning theories with human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) to support reflective, iterative learning. Implemented in EduAlly, an AI-assisted platform for writing-intensive and feedback-sensitive tasks, the framework emphasizes transparency, self-regulated learning, and pedagogical oversight. A mixed-methods study was piloted at a comprehensive public university to evaluate alignment between AI-generated feedback, instructor evaluations, and student self-assessments; the impact of iterative revision on performance; and student perceptions of AI feedback. Quantitative results demonstrated statistically significant improvement between first and second attempts, with agreement between student self-evaluations and final instructor grades. Qualitative findings indicated students valued immediacy, specificity, and opportunities for growth that AI feedback provided. These findings validate the potential to enhance student learning outcomes through developmentally grounded, ethically aligned, and scalable AI feedback systems. The study concludes with implications for future interdisciplinary applications and refinement of AI-supported educational technologies."
2508.00973,"Industry 5.0 marks a new phase in industrial evolution, emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience through the integration of advanced technologies. Within this evolving landscape, Generative AI (GenAI) and autonomous systems are not only transforming industrial processes but also emerging as pivotal geopolitical instruments. We examine strategic implications of GenAI in Industry 5.0, arguing that these technologies have become national assets central to sovereignty, access, and global influence. As countries compete for AI supremacy, growing disparities in talent, computational infrastructure, and data access are reshaping global power hierarchies and accelerating the fragmentation of the digital economy. The human-centric ethos of Industry 5.0, anchored in collaboration between humans and intelligent systems, increasingly conflicts with the autonomy and opacity of GenAI, raising urgent governance challenges related to meaningful human control, dual-use risks, and accountability. We analyze how these dynamics influence defense strategies, industrial competitiveness, and supply chain resilience, including the geopolitical weaponization of export controls and the rise of data sovereignty. Our contribution synthesizes technological, economic, and ethical perspectives to propose a comprehensive framework for navigating the intersection of GenAI and geopolitics. We call for governance models that balance national autonomy with international coordination while safeguarding human-centric values in an increasingly AI-driven world."
2508.01003,"The rapid integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into postsecondary education and many other sectors resulted in a global reckoning with this new technology. This paper contributes to the study of the multifaceted influence of generative AI, with a particular focus on OpenAI's ChatGPT within academic settings during the first six months after the release in three specific ways. First, it scrutinizes the rise of ChatGPT as a transformative event construed through a study of mainstream discourses exhibiting AI hype. Second, it discusses the perceived implications of generative AI for writing, teaching, and learning through the lens of critical discourse analysis and critical AI studies. Third, it encourages the necessity for best practices in the adoption of generative AI technologies in education."
2508.01042,"There is a growing discussion about social media feeds being increasingly filled with AI-generated content. Due to its visual plausibility, low cost, and fast production speed, AI-generated content is said to be highly effective in ""gaming the algorithm"" and going viral. Popularly referred to as ""AI slop,"" this phenomenon arguably leads to the presence of sloppy and potentially deceptive content at a scale unseen before. This investigation offers a systematic analysis of AI-generated content and its labelling in TikTok's and Instagram's search results across 13 hashtags (see Appendix) in three European countries (Spain, Germany, and Poland) over the course of June 2025. We manually annotated and analyzed the 30 top search results on political (#trump, #zelensky, #pope) and broader topics (e.g.,#health, #history) to understand the relation between synthetic (content that is partially or entirely made using generative AI) and non-synthetic content across languages and countries. We then explored the emerging phenomenon of accounts producing generative AI content at scale by analyzing 153 accounts and proposing a new categorization schema of what we termed Agentic AI Accounts. Our main findings are:"
2508.01091,"Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, have emerged as essential tools for information retrieval, often serving as alternatives to traditional search engines. However, ensuring that these models provide accurate and equitable information tailored to diverse demographic groups remains an important challenge. This study investigates the capability of LLMs to retrieve disaggregated health-related information for sub-ethnic groups within the Asian American population, such as Korean and Chinese communities. Data disaggregation has been a critical practice in health research to address inequities, making it an ideal domain for evaluating representation equity in LLM outputs. We apply a suite of statistical and machine learning tools to assess whether LLMs deliver appropriately disaggregated and equitable information. By focusing on Asian American sub-ethnic groups, a highly diverse population often aggregated in traditional analyses; we highlight how LLMs handle complex disparities in health data. Our findings contribute to ongoing discussions about responsible AI, particularly in ensuring data equity in the outputs of LLM-based systems."
2508.01142,"Rural Bangladesh is confronted with substantial healthcare obstacles, such as inadequate infrastructure, inadequate information systems, and restricted access to medical personnel. These obstacles impede effective disease control and pandemic preparedness. This investigation employs a structured methodology to develop and analyze numerous plausible scenarios systematically. A purposive sampling strategy was implemented, which involved the administration of a questionnaire survey to 264 rural residents in the Rangamati district of Bangladesh and the completion of a distinct questionnaire by 103 healthcare and medical personnel. The impact and effectiveness of the study are assessed through logistic regression analysis and a pre-post comparison that employs the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Kendall's coefficient for non-parametric paired and categorical variables. This analysis evaluates the evolution of disease control and preparedness prior to and subsequent to the implementation of the Generative AI-Based Model 4.0. The results indicate that trust in AI (\b{eta} = 1.20, p = 0.020) and confidence in sharing health data (\b{eta} = 9.049, p = 0.020) are the most significant predictors of AI adoption. At the same time, infrastructure limitations and digital access constraints continue to be significant constraints. The study concludes that the health resilience and pandemic preparedness of marginalized rural populations can be improved through AI-driven, localized disease control strategies. The integration of Generative AI into rural healthcare systems offers a transformative opportunity, but it is contingent upon active community engagement, enhanced digital literacy, and strong government involvement."
2508.01169,"This work-in-progress paper presents SPARC (Systematic Problem Solving and Algorithmic Reasoning for Children), a gamified learning platform designed to enhance engagement and knowledge retention in K-12 STEM education. Traditional approaches often struggle to motivate students or facilitate deep understanding, especially for complex scientific concepts. SPARC addresses these challenges by integrating interactive, narrative-driven gameplay with an artificial intelligence peer agent built on large language models. Rather than simply providing answers, the agent engages students in dialogue and inquiry, prompting them to explain concepts and solve problems collaboratively. The platform's design is grounded in educational theory and closely aligned with state learning standards. Initial classroom pilots utilized a multi-method assessment framework combining pre- and post-tests, in-game analytics, and qualitative feedback from students and teachers. Preliminary findings indicate that SPARC significantly increases student engagement, with most participants reporting greater interest in STEM subjects and moderate gains in conceptual understanding observed in post-test results. Ongoing development focuses on refining the AI agent, expanding curriculum integration, and improving accessibility. These early results demonstrate the potential of combining AI-driven peer support with game-based learning to create inclusive, effective, and engaging educational experiences for K-12 learners."
2508.0139,"Online behavioural research faces an emerging threat as participants increasingly turn to large language models (LLMs) for advice, translation, or task delegation: LLM Pollution. We identify three interacting variants through which LLM Pollution threatens the validity and integrity of online behavioural research. First, Partial LLM Mediation occurs when participants make selective use of LLMs for specific aspects of a task, such as translation or wording support, leading researchers to (mis)interpret LLM-shaped outputs as human ones. Second, Full LLM Delegation arises when agentic LLMs complete studies with little to no human oversight, undermining the central premise of human-subject research at a more foundational level. Third, LLM Spillover signifies human participants altering their behaviour as they begin to anticipate LLM presence in online studies, even when none are involved. While Partial Mediation and Full Delegation form a continuum of increasing automation, LLM Spillover reflects second-order reactivity effects. Together, these variants interact and generate cascading distortions that compromise sample authenticity, introduce biases that are difficult to detect post hoc, and ultimately undermine the epistemic grounding of online research on human cognition and behaviour. Crucially, the threat of LLM Pollution is already co-evolving with advances in generative AI, creating an escalating methodological arms race. To address this, we propose a multi-layered response spanning researcher practices, platform accountability, and community efforts. As the challenge evolves, coordinated adaptation will be essential to safeguard methodological integrity and preserve the validity of online behavioural research."
2508.01408,"The attribution of artworks in general and of paintings in particular has always been an issue in art. The advent of powerful artificial intelligence models that can generate and analyze images creates new challenges for painting attribution. On the one hand, AI models can create images that mimic the style of a painter, which can be incorrectly attributed, for example, by other AI models. On the other hand, AI models may not be able to correctly identify the artist for real paintings, inducing users to incorrectly attribute paintings. In this paper, both problems are experimentally studied using state-of-the-art AI models for image generation and analysis on a large dataset with close to 40,000 paintings from 128 artists. The results show that vision language models have limited capabilities to: 1) perform canvas attribution and 2) to identify AI generated images. As users increasingly rely on queries to AI models to get information, these results show the need to improve the capabilities of VLMs to reliably perform artist attribution and detection of AI generated images to prevent the spread of incorrect information."
2508.01735,"Computer science students often struggle with abstract theoretical concepts, particularly in introductory courses on theoretical computer science. One such challenge is understanding context-free languages and their various representations.In this study we investigate factors that influence the difficulty of constructing context-free grammars and pushdown automata for context-free languages. We propose two potential difficulty generating factors targeting how a language is presented to students: representation in natural language and as a verbose set notation. Furthermore, we propose two factors targeting the structure of the given context-free language: nesting of constructs and insertion of multiplicities.We conducted a controlled experiment using within-subject randomization in an interactive learning system, testing the proposed difficulty factors for constructing context-free grammars and pushdown automata. Our results suggest that three of the four factors significantly influence students' objective performance in solving exercises for constructing context-free grammars, while students' perceived difficulties only partly align with the objective performance measures. The findings for pushdown automata tasks differed markedly from those for context-free grammar tasks. Our variations either had negligible effects or, in some cases, even reduced difficulty. Thus, no robust statistical conclusions can be made for pushdown automata tasks.The results lay foundations for learning systems that adaptively choose appropriate exercises for individual students."
2508.01779,"This paper presents a detailed case study of how artificial intelligence, especially large language models, can be integrated into historical research workflows. The workflow is divided into nine steps, covering the full research cycle from question formulation to dissemination and reproducibility, and includes two framing phases that address setup and documentation. Each research step is mapped across three operational domains: 1. LLM, referring to tasks delegated to language models; 2. Mind, referring to conceptual and interpretive contributions by the historian; and 3. Computational, referring to conventional programming-based methods like Python, R, Cytoscape, etc. The study emphasizes that LLMs are not replacements for domain expertise but can support and expand capacity of historians to process, verify, and interpret large corpora of texts. At the same time, it highlights the necessity of rigorous quality control, cross-checking outputs, and maintaining scholarly standards. Drawing from an in-depth study of three Shanghai merchants, the paper also proposes a structured workflow based on a real case study hat articulates the cognitive labor of the historian with both computational tools and generative AI. This paper makes both a methodological and epistemological contribution by showing how AI can be responsibly incorporated into historical research through transparent and reproducible workflows. It is intended as a practical guide and critical reflection for historians facing the increasingly complex landscape of AI-enhanced scholarship."
2508.01926,"As generative AI (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT become more common in higher education, understanding student attitudes is essential for evaluating their educational impact and supporting responsible AI integration. This study introduces a validated survey instrument designed to assess students' perceptions of GenAI, including its acceptability for academic tasks, perceived influence on learning and careers, and broader societal concerns. We administered the survey to 297 undergraduates at a U.S. university. The instrument includes six thematic domains: institutional understanding, fairness and trust, academic and career influence, societal concerns, and GenAI use in writing and coursework. Exploratory factor analysis revealed four attitudinal dimensions: societal concern, policy clarity, fairness and trust, and career impact. Subgroup analyses identified statistically significant differences across student backgrounds. Male students and those speaking a language other than English at home rated GenAI use in writing tasks as more acceptable. First-year students expressed greater societal concern than upper-year peers. Students from multilingual households perceived greater clarity in institutional policy, while first-generation students reported a stronger belief in GenAI's impact on future careers. This work contributes a practical scale for evaluating the student impact of GenAI tools, informing the design of educational AI systems."
2508.02086,"This study investigates how media influence and educational resources shape individual engagement with cryptocurrencies. As digital assets become increasingly mainstream, social media platforms, influencers, and financial analysts play a central role in driving public interest and investment behavior. Quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews reveal that persuasive narratives and success stories on social media often attract new investors, while accessible educational materials empower individuals to make informed decisions in a volatile market. The findings highlight that media exposure can spark initial adoption, but sustained and responsible participation depends on comprehensive education in cryptocurrency fundamentals, trading strategies, and blockchain technology"
2508.02442,"This study investigates the reliability and validity of five advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), Claude 3.5, DeepSeek v2, Gemini 2.5, GPT-4, and Mistral 24B, for automated essay scoring in a real world higher education context. A total of 67 Italian-language student essays, written as part of a university psychology course, were evaluated using a four-criterion rubric (Pertinence, Coherence, Originality, Feasibility). Each model scored all essays across three prompt replications to assess intra-model stability. Human-LLM agreement was consistently low and non-significant (Quadratic Weighted Kappa), and within-model reliability across replications was similarly weak (median Kendall's W < 0.30). Systematic scoring divergences emerged, including a tendency to inflate Coherence and inconsistent handling of context-dependent dimensions. Inter-model agreement analysis revealed moderate convergence for Coherence and Originality, but negligible concordance for Pertinence and Feasibility. Although limited in scope, these findings suggest that current LLMs may struggle to replicate human judgment in tasks requiring disciplinary insight and contextual sensitivity. Human oversight remains critical when evaluating open-ended academic work, particularly in interpretive domains."
2508.02731,"Evaluating teaching effectiveness at scale remains a persistent challenge for large universities, particularly within engineering programs that enroll tens of thousands of students. Traditional methods, such as manual review of student evaluations, are often impractical, leading to overlooked insights and inconsistent data use. This article presents a scalable, AI-supported framework for synthesizing qualitative student feedback using large language models. The system employs hierarchical summarization, anonymization, and exception handling to extract actionable themes from open-ended comments while upholding ethical safeguards. Visual analytics contextualize numeric scores through percentile-based comparisons, historical trends, and instructional load. The approach supports meaningful evaluation and aligns with best practices in qualitative analysis and educational assessment, incorporating student, peer, and self-reflective inputs without automating personnel decisions. We report on its successful deployment across a large college of engineering. Preliminary validation through comparisons with human reviewers, faculty feedback, and longitudinal analysis suggests that LLM-generated summaries can reliably support formative evaluation and professional development. This work demonstrates how AI systems, when designed with transparency and shared governance, can promote teaching excellence and continuous improvement at scale within academic institutions."
2508.02748,"AI policy should advance AI innovation by ensuring that its potential benefits are responsibly realized and widely shared. To achieve this, AI policymaking should place a premium on evidence: Scientific understanding and systematic analysis should inform policy, and policy should accelerate evidence generation. But policy outcomes reflect institutional constraints, political dynamics, electoral pressures, stakeholder interests, media environment, economic considerations, cultural contexts, and leadership perspectives. Adding to this complexity is the reality that the broad reach of AI may mean that evidence and policy are misaligned: Although some evidence and policy squarely address AI, much more partially intersects with AI. Well-designed policy should integrate evidence that reflects scientific understanding rather than hype. An increasing number of efforts address this problem by often either (i) contributing research into the risks of AI and their effective mitigation or (ii) advocating for policy to address these risks. This paper tackles the hard problem of how to optimize the relationship between evidence and policy to address the opportunities and challenges of increasingly powerful AI."
2508.0276,"The accelerated evolution of digital infrastructures and algorithmic systems is reshaping how the humanities engage with knowledge and culture. Rooted in the traditions of Digital Humanities and Digital Humanism, the concept of ""Cyber Humanities"" proposes a critical reconfiguration of humanistic inquiry for the post-digital era. This Manifesto introduces a flexible framework that integrates ethical design, sustainable digital practices, and participatory knowledge systems grounded in human-centered approaches. By means of a Decalogue of foundational principles, the Manifesto invites the scientific community to critically examine and reimagine the algorithmic infrastructures that influence culture, creativity, and collective memory.Rather than being a simple extension of existing practices, ""Cyber Humanities"" should be understood as a foundational paradigm for humanistic inquiry in a computationally mediated world.Keywords: Cyber Humanities, Digital Humanities, Transdisciplinary Epistemology, Algorithmic Reflexivity, Human-centered AI, Ethics-by-Design, Knowledge Ecosystems, Digital Sovereignty, Cognitive Infrastructures"
2508.02765,"The Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6's mandatory 2026 implementation transforms residential property valuation from narrative reporting to structured, machine-readable formats. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of this regulatory shift alongside concurrent AI advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous systems. We develop a three-layer framework for AI-augmented valuation addressing technical implementation and institutional trust requirements. Our analysis reveals how regulatory standardization converging with AI capabilities enables fundamental market restructuring with profound implications for professional practice, efficiency, and systemic risk. We make four key contributions: (1) documenting institutional failures including inter-appraiser variability and systematic biases undermining valuation reliability; (2) developing an architectural framework spanning physical data acquisition, semantic understanding, and cognitive reasoning that integrates emerging technologies while maintaining professional oversight; (3) addressing trust requirements for high-stakes financial applications including regulatory compliance, algorithmic fairness, and uncertainty quantification; (4) proposing evaluation methodologies beyond generic AI benchmarks toward domain-specific protocols. Our findings indicate successful transformation requires not merely technological sophistication but careful human-AI collaboration, creating systems that augment rather than replace professional expertise while addressing historical biases and information asymmetries in real estate markets."
2508.02766,"In everyday life, people make countless reasonableness judgments that determine appropriate behavior in various contexts. Predicting these judgments challenges the legal system, as judges' intuitions may not align with broader societal views. This Article investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can learn to identify patterns driving human reasonableness judgments.Using randomized controlled trials comparing humans and models across multiple legal contexts with over 10,000 simulated judgments, we demonstrate that certain models capture not just surface-level responses but potentially their underlying decisional architecture. Strikingly, these systems prioritize social cues over economic efficiency in negligence determinations, mirroring human behavior despite contradicting textbook treatments.These findings suggest practical applications: judges could calibrate intuitions against broader patterns, lawmakers could test policy interpretations, and resource-constrained litigants could preview argument reception. As AI agents increasingly make autonomous real-world decisions, understanding whether they've internalized recognizable ethical frameworks becomes essential for anticipating their behavior."
2508.02773,"The convergence of Web3 technologies and AI agents represents a rapidly evolving frontier poised to reshape decentralized ecosystems. This paper presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics, governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3 governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing (RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust, intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent interactions."
2508.02937,"A significant majority of AI fairness research studying the harmful outcomes of GAI tools have overlooked non-Western communities and contexts, necessitating a stronger coverage in this vein. We extend our previous work on exoticism (Ghosh et al., 2024) of 'Global South' countries from across the world, as depicted by GAI tools. We analyze generated images of individuals from 13 countries -- India, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea, Egypt, Ethiopia, Tunisia, Sudan, Libya, Venezuela, Colombia, Indonesia, Honduras, and Mexico -- performing everyday activities (such as being at home, going to work, getting groceries, etc.), as opposed to images for the same activities being performed by persons from 3 'Global North' countries -- USA, UK, Australia. While outputs for 'Global North' demonstrate a difference across images and people clad in activity-appropriate attire, individuals from 'Global South' countries are depicted in similar attire irrespective of the performed activity, indicative of a pattern of exoticism where attire or other cultural features are overamplified at the cost of accuracy. We further show qualitatively-analyzed case studies that demonstrate how exoticism is not simply performed upon 'Global South' countries but also upon marginalized populations even in Western contexts, as we observe a similar exoticization of Indigenous populations in the 'Global North', and doubly upon marginalized populations within 'Global South' countries. We document implications for harm-aware usage patterns of such tools, and steps towards designing better GAI tools through community-centered endeavors."
2508.03666,"The discourse on responsible artificial intelligence (AI) regulation is understandably dominated by risk-focused assessments and analyses. This approach reflects the fundamental uncertainty policymakers face when determining appropriate responses to current, emerging and novel AI systems. In this article, we argue that by operationalising the concept of freedom - the philosophical counterpart to responsibility - a complementary approach centred on the potential societal benefits of AI systems can be developed. The result is a discursive framework grounded in freedom as capability and freedom as opportunity, which represent the two main intellectual traditions of interpreting freedom. We contend that the complexity, ambiguity and contestation involved in regulating AI systems make a deliberative paradigm more useful than the conventional technical one. The resulting framework is structured around coordinative, communicative and decision spaces, each with sequential focal points and associated outputs."
2508.03718,"U.S. health insurance is complex, and inadequate understanding and limited access to justice have dire implications for the most vulnerable. Advances in natural language processing present an opportunity to support efficient, case-specific understanding, and to improve access to justice and healthcare. Yet existing corpora lack context necessary for assessing even simple cases. We collect and release a corpus of reputable legal and medical text related to U.S. health insurance. We also introduce an outcome prediction task for health insurance appeals designed to support regulatory and patient self-help applications, and release a labeled benchmark for our task, and models trained on it."
2508.03769,"The study addresses the paradigm shift in corporate management, where AI is moving from a decision support tool to an autonomous decision-maker, with some AI systems already appointed to leadership roles in companies. A central problem identified is that the development of AI technologies is far outpacing the creation of adequate legal and ethical guidelines.The research proposes a ""reference model"" for the development and implementation of autonomous AI systems in corporate management. This model is based on a synthesis of several key components to ensure legitimate and ethical decision-making. The model introduces the concept of ""computational law"" or ""algorithmic law"". This involves creating a separate legal framework for AI systems, with rules and regulations translated into a machine-readable, algorithmic format to avoid the ambiguity of natural language. The paper emphasises the need for a ""dedicated operational context"" for autonomous AI systems, analogous to the ""operational design domain"" for autonomous vehicles. This means creating a specific, clearly defined environment and set of rules within which the AI can operate safely and effectively. The model advocates for training AI systems on controlled, synthetically generated data to ensure fairness and ethical considerations are embedded from the start. Game theory is also proposed as a method for calculating the optimal strategy for the AI to achieve its goals within these ethical and legal constraints. The provided analysis highlights the importance of explainable AI (XAI) to ensure the transparency and accountability of decisions made by autonomous systems. This is crucial for building trust and for complying with the ""right to explanation""."
2508.03771,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), becomes increasingly embedded in education systems worldwide, ensuring their ethical, legal, and contextually appropriate deployment has become a critical policy concern. This paper offers a comparative analysis of AI-related regulatory and ethical frameworks across key global regions, including the European Union, United Kingdom, United States, China, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. It maps how core trustworthiness principles, such as transparency, fairness, accountability, data privacy, and human oversight are embedded in regional legislation and AI governance structures. Special emphasis is placed on the evolving landscape in the GCC, where countries are rapidly advancing national AI strategies and education-sector innovation. To support this development, the paper introduces a Compliance-Centered AI Governance Framework tailored to the GCC context. This includes a tiered typology and institutional checklist designed to help regulators, educators, and developers align AI adoption with both international norms and local values. By synthesizing global best practices with region-specific challenges, the paper contributes practical guidance for building legally sound, ethically grounded, and culturally sensitive AI systems in education. These insights are intended to inform future regulatory harmonization and promote responsible AI integration across diverse educational environments."
2508.04281,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining traction as a method to generate consensus statements and aggregate preferences in digital democracy experiments. Yet, LLMs may introduce critical vulnerabilities in these systems. Here, we explore the impact of prompt-injection attacks targeting consensus generating systems by introducing a four-dimensional taxonomy of attacks. We test these attacks using LLaMA 3.1 8B and Chat GPT 4.1 Nano finding the LLMs more vulnerable to criticism attacks -- attacks using disagreeable prompts -- and more effective at tilting ambiguous consensus statements. We also find evidence of more effective manipulation when using explicit imperatives and rational-sounding arguments compared to emotional language or fabricated statistics. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), an alignment method that fine-tunes LLMs to prefer unperturbed consensus statements. While DPO significantly improves robustness, it still offers limited protection against attacks targeting ambiguous consensus. These results advance our understanding of the vulnerability and robustness of consensus generating LLMs in digital democracy applications."
2508.04504,"How to avoid discrimination in the context of NLP technology is one of the major challenges in the field. We propose that a different and more substantiated framing of the problem could help to find more productive approaches. In the first part of the paper we report on a case study: a qualitative review on papers published in the ACL anthologies 2022 on discriminatory behavior of NLP systems. We find that the field (i) still has a strong focus on a technological fix of algorithmic discrimination, and (ii) is struggling with a firm grounding of their ethical or normative vocabulary. Furthermore, this vocabulary is very limited, focusing mostly on the terms ""harm"" and ""bias"". In the second part of the paper we argue that addressing the latter problems might help with the former. The understanding of algorithmic discrimination as a technological problem is reflected in and reproduced by the vocabulary in use. The notions of ""harm"" and ""bias"" implicate a narrow framing of the issue of discrimination as one of the system-user interface. We argue that instead of ""harm"" the debate should make ""injustice"" the key notion. This would force us to understand the problem of algorithmic discrimination as a systemic problem. Thereby, it would broaden our perspective on the complex interactions that make NLP technology participate in discrimination. With that gain in perspective we can consider new angles for solutions."
2508.04586,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences are essential for advancing research, sharing knowledge, and fostering academic community. However, their rapid expansion has rendered the centralized conference model increasingly unsustainable. This paper offers a data-driven diagnosis of a structural crisis that threatens the foundational goals of scientific dissemination, equity, and community well-being. We identify four key areas of strain: (1) scientifically, with per-author publication rates more than doubling over the past decade to over 4.5 papers annually; (2) environmentally, with the carbon footprint of a single conference exceeding the daily emissions of its host city; (3) psychologically, with 71% of online community discourse reflecting negative sentiment and 35% referencing mental health concerns; and (4) logistically, with attendance at top conferences such as NeurIPS 2024 beginning to outpace venue capacity. These pressures point to a system that is misaligned with its core mission. In response, we propose the Community-Federated Conference (CFC) model, which separates peer review, presentation, and networking into globally coordinated but locally organized components, offering a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient path forward for AI research."
2508.04725,"Augmentation technologies are undergoing a process of enculturation due to many factors, one being the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), or what the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) terms the AI wave or AI boom. Chapter 3 focuses critical attention on the hyped assumption that sophisticated, emergent, and embodied augmentation technologies will improve lives, literacy, cultures, arts, economies, and social contexts. The chapter begins by discussing the problem of ambiguity with AI terminology, which it aids with a description of the WIPO Categorization of AI Technologies Scheme. It then draws on media and communication studies to explore concepts such as agents, agency, power, and agentive relationships between humans and robots. The chapter focuses on the development of non-human agents in industry as a critical factor in the rise of augmentation technologies. It looks at how marketing communication enculturates future users to adopt and adapt to the technology. Scholars are charting the significant ways that people are drawn further into commercial digital landscapes, such as the Metaverse concept, in post-internet society. It concludes by examining recent claims concerning the Metaverse and augmented reality."
2508.05223,"The discourse about sustainable technology has emerged from the acknowledgment of the environmental collapse we are facing. In this paper, we argue that addressing this crisis requires more than the development of sustainable alternatives to current online services or the optimization of resources using various dashboards and AI. Rather, the focus must shift toward designing technologies that protect us from the consequences of the environmental damages. Among these consequences, wars, genocide and new forms of colonialism are perhaps the most significant. We identify ""protection"" not in terms of military defense as Western States like to argue, but as part of sovereignty. We seek to define the term of ""Resistance Technologies"" for such technologies, arguing further that anti-surveillance technologies are a foundational component of sovereignty and must be part of future conversations around sustainability. Finally, our paper seeks to open a discourse with the Computing-within-Limits community and beyond, towards defining other essential aspects or concepts of technologies that we see as core values of ""Resistance Technology""."
2508.05286,"Computer science education is a dynamic field with many aspects that influence the learner's path. While these aspects are usually studied in depth separately, it is also important to carry out broader large-scale studies that touch on many topics, because they allow us to put different results into each other's perspective. Past large-scale surveys have provided valuable insights, however, the emergence of new trends (e.g., AI), new learning formats (e.g., in-IDE learning), and the increasing learner diversity highlight the need for an updated comprehensive study. To address this, we conducted a survey with 18,032 learners from 173 countries, ensuring diverse representation and exploring a wide range of topics - formal education, learning formats, AI usage, challenges, motivation, and more. This paper introduces the results of this survey as an open dataset, describes our methodology and the survey questions, and highlights, as a motivating example, three possible research directions within this data: challenges in learning, emerging formats, and insights into the in-IDE format. The dataset aims to support further research and foster advancements in computer education."
2508.0536,"There has been rapid development in generative AI tools across the education sector, which in turn is leading to increased adoption by teachers. However, this raises concerns regarding the safety and age-appropriateness of the AI-generated content that is being created for use in classrooms. This paper explores Oak National Academy's approach to addressing these concerns within the development of the UK Government's first publicly available generative AI tool - our AI-powered lesson planning assistant (Aila). Aila is intended to support teachers planning national curriculum-aligned lessons that are appropriate for pupils aged 5-16 years. To mitigate safety risks associated with AI-generated content we have implemented four key safety guardrails - (1) prompt engineering to ensure AI outputs are generated within pedagogically sound and curriculum-aligned parameters, (2) input threat detection to mitigate attacks, (3) an Independent Asynchronous Content Moderation Agent (IACMA) to assess outputs against predefined safety categories, and (4) taking a human-in-the-loop approach, to encourage teachers to review generated content before it is used in the classroom. Through our on-going evaluation of these safety guardrails we have identified several challenges and opportunities to take into account when implementing and testing safety guardrails. This paper highlights ways to build more effective safety guardrails in generative AI education tools including the on-going iteration and refinement of guardrails, as well as enabling cross-sector collaboration through sharing both open-source code, datasets and learnings."
2508.05846,"As artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics increasingly permeate society, ensuring the ethical behavior of these systems has become paramount. This paper contends that transparency in AI decision-making processes is fundamental to developing trustworthy and ethically aligned robotic systems. We explore how transparency facilitates accountability, enables informed consent, and supports the debugging of ethical algorithms. The paper outlines technical, ethical, and practical challenges in implementing transparency and proposes novel approaches to enhance it, including standardized metrics, explainable AI techniques, and user-friendly interfaces. This paper introduces a framework that connects technical implementation with ethical considerations in robotic systems, focusing on the specific challenges of achieving transparency in dynamic, real-world contexts. We analyze how prioritizing transparency can impact public trust, regulatory policies, and avenues for future research. By positioning transparency as a fundamental element in ethical AI system design, we aim to add to the ongoing discussion on responsible AI and robotics, providing direction for future advancements in this vital field."
2508.05849,"The proliferation of misinformation on social media has concerning possible consequences, such as the degradation of democratic norms. While recent research on countering misinformation has largely focused on analyzing the effectiveness of interventions, the factors associated with public support for these interventions have received little attention. We asked 1,010 American social media users to rate their support for and perceptions of ten misinformation interventions implemented by the government or social media companies. Our results indicate that the perceived fairness of the intervention is the most important factor in determining support, followed by the perceived effectiveness of that intervention and then the intrusiveness. Interventions that supported user agency and transparency, such as labeling content or fact-checking ads, were more popular than those that involved moderating or removing content or accounts. We found some demographic differences in support levels, with Democrats and women supporting interventions more and finding them more fair, more effective, and less intrusive than Republicans and men, respectively. It is critical to understand which interventions are supported and why, as public opinion can play a key role in the rollout and effectiveness of policies."
2508.0586,"Due to its significant and growing environmental harms, both directly through its materiality and indirectly through its pervasive integration into unsustainable economic systems, ICT will need to be radically redirected to align with sustainability-oriented futures. While the role of ICT in such futures will likely diverge significantly from current dynamics, it will probably not be entirely disconnected from the present. Instead, such transition involves complex dynamics of continuity, adaptation and rupture. Drawing from recent work in transition studies, the commons (particularly ""negative commons""), as well as some of the Limits literature, this article proposes a conceptual framework for navigating this redirection. The framework attempts to bring together the disentanglement from sociotechnical elements incompatible with long-term sustainability and the support of existing practices that may serve as foundations for alternative technological paths. It introduces four categories: ruins, ghosts, seeds and visions, to examine how material and cultural aspects of computing may become obsolete, persist in latent or reinterpreted forms, or contribute to sustainability-oriented futures. Through both empirical and speculative examples, I intend to show how this lens can help researchers and practitioners engage more concretely with the tensions, inheritances, and opportunities involved in redirecting computing towards more sustainable and equitable futures."
2508.05867,"The advent of continuously learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistants marks a paradigm shift from episodic interactions to persistent, memory-driven relationships. This paper introduces the concept of ""Cognitive Sovereignty"", the ability of individuals, groups, and nations to maintain autonomous thought and preserve identity in the age of powerful AI systems, especially those that hold their deep personal memory. It argues that the primary risk of these technologies transcends traditional data privacy to become an issue of cognitive and geopolitical control. We propose ""Network Effect 2.0,"" a model where value scales with the depth of personalized memory, creating powerful cognitive moats and unprecedented user lock-in. We analyze the psychological risks of such systems, including cognitive offloading and identity dependency, by drawing on the ""extended mind"" thesis. These individual-level risks scale to geopolitical threats, such as a new form of digital colonialism and subtle shifting of public discourse. To counter these threats, we propose a policy framework centered on memory portability, transparency, sovereign cognitive infrastructure, and strategic alliances. This work reframes the discourse on AI assistants in an era of increasingly intimate machines, pointing to challenges to individual and national sovereignty."
2508.05869,"The material footprint of information and communications technology (ICT) systems is both significant and growing, inspiring a variety of conversations around sustainability and climate justice. In part this effort has been catalysed by past scholarship and analysis from the LIMITS community. This paper examines energy storage systems for computing, particularly batteries -- which are discarded at the rate of 15 billion a year worldwide. The International Energy Agency (IEA) is now referring to the energy transition toward low carbon systems as a critical mineral problem, and countries are speaking openly of 'mineral security' in policy documents. In this paper I 1) present a definition for energy experience and what this means for the design and making of devices, interactions and experiences. I also 2) explore a series of electronics device prototypes converted to run from batteryless sustainable energy that are extremely long lasting, and make limited use of critical minerals. As transitional energy experience device-design experiments, what do prototypes like these suggest for more mainstream, mass-manufactured systems?"
2508.05929,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) holds a potential to advance existing educational technologies with capabilities to automatically generate personalised scaffolds that support students' self-regulated learning (SRL). While advancements in large language models (LLMs) promise improvements in the adaptability and quality of educational technologies for SRL, there remain concerns about the hallucinations in content generated by LLMs, which can compromise both the learning experience and ethical standards. To address these challenges, we proposed GenAI-enabled approaches for evaluating personalised SRL scaffolds before they are presented to students, aiming for reducing hallucinations and improving the overall quality of LLM-generated personalised scaffolds. Specifically, two approaches are investigated. The first approach involved developing a multi-agent system approach for reliability evaluation to assess the extent to which LLM-generated scaffolds accurately target relevant SRL processes. The second approach utilised the ""LLM-as-a-Judge"" technique for quality evaluation that evaluates LLM-generated scaffolds for their helpfulness in supporting students. We constructed evaluation datasets, and compared our results with single-agent LLM systems and machine learning approach baselines. Our findings indicate that the reliability evaluation approach is highly effective and outperforms the baselines, showing almost perfect alignment with human experts' evaluations. Moreover, both proposed evaluation approaches can be harnessed to effectively reduce hallucinations. Additionally, we identified and discussed bias limitations of the ""LLM-as-a-Judge"" technique in evaluating LLM-generated scaffolds. We suggest incorporating these approaches into GenAI-powered personalised SRL scaffolding systems to mitigate hallucination issues and improve the overall scaffolding quality."
2508.05952,"The use of LLM tutors to provide automated educational feedback to students on student assignment submissions has received much attention in the AI in Education field. However, the stochastic nature and tendency for hallucinations in LLMs can undermine both quality of learning experience and adherence to ethical standards. To address this concern, we propose a method that uses LLM feedback evaluators (DeanLLMs) to automatically and comprehensively evaluate feedback generated by LLM tutor for submissions on university assignments before it is delivered to students. This allows low-quality feedback to be rejected and enables LLM tutors to improve the feedback they generated based on the evaluation results. We first proposed a comprehensive evaluation framework for LLM-generated educational feedback, comprising six dimensions for feedback content, seven for feedback effectiveness, and three for hallucination types. Next, we generated a virtual assignment submission dataset covering 85 university assignments from 43 computer science courses using eight commonly used commercial LLMs. We labelled and open-sourced the assignment dataset to support the fine-tuning and evaluation of LLM feedback evaluators. Our findings show that o3-pro demonstrated the best performance in zero-shot labelling of feedback while o4-mini demonstrated the best performance in few-shot labelling of feedback. Moreover, GPT-4.1 achieved human expert level performance after fine-tuning (Accuracy 79.8%, F1-score 79.4%; human average Accuracy 78.3%, F1-score 82.6%). Finally, we used our best-performance model to evaluate 2,000 assignment feedback instances generated by 10 common commercial LLMs, 200 each, to compare the quality of feedback generated by different LLMs. Our LLM feedback evaluator method advances our ability to automatically provide high-quality and reliable educational feedback to students."
2508.05953,"Using LLMs to give educational feedback to students for their assignments has attracted much attention in the AI in Education field. Yet, there is currently no large-scale open-source dataset of student assignments that includes detailed assignment descriptions, rubrics, and student submissions across various courses. As a result, research on generalisable methodology for automatic generation of effective and responsible educational feedback remains limited. In the current study, we constructed a large-scale dataset of Synthetic Computer science Assignments for LLM-generated Educational Feedback research (SCALEFeedback). We proposed a Sophisticated Assignment Mimicry (SAM) framework to generate the synthetic dataset by one-to-one LLM-based imitation from real assignment descriptions, student submissions to produce their synthetic versions. Our open-source dataset contains 10,000 synthetic student submissions spanning 155 assignments across 59 university-level computer science courses. Our synthetic submissions achieved BERTScore F1 0.84, PCC of 0.62 for assignment marks and 0.85 for length, compared to the corresponding real-world assignment dataset, while ensuring perfect protection of student private information. All these results of our SAM framework outperformed results of a naive mimicry method baseline. The LLM-generated feedback for our synthetic assignments demonstrated the same level of effectiveness compared to that of real-world assignment dataset. Our research showed that one-to-one LLM imitation is a promising method for generating open-source synthetic educational datasets that preserve the original dataset's semantic meaning and student data distribution, while protecting student privacy and institutional copyright. SCALEFeedback enhances our ability to develop LLM-based generalisable methods for offering high-quality, automated educational feedback in a scalable way."
2508.05979,"While Large Language Models (LLMs) are often used as virtual tutors in computer science (CS) education, this approach can foster passive learning and over-reliance. This paper presents a novel pedagogical paradigm that inverts this model: students act as instructors who must teach an LLM to solve problems. To facilitate this, we developed strategies for designing questions with engineered knowledge gaps that only a student can bridge, and we introduce Socrates, a system for deploying this method with minimal overhead. We evaluated our approach in an undergraduate course and found that this active-learning method led to statistically significant improvements in student performance compared to historical cohorts. Our work demonstrates a practical, cost-effective framework for using LLMs to deepen student engagement and mastery."
2508.05992,"Sustainability-driven computing research - encompassing equity, diversity, climate change, and social justice - is increasingly dismissed as woke or even dangerous in many sociopolitical contexts. As misinformation, ideological polarisation, deliberate ignorance and reactionary narratives gain ground, how can sustainability research in computing continue to exist and make an impact? This paper explores these tensions through Fictomorphosis, a creative story retelling method that reframes contested topics through different genres and perspectives. By engaging computing researchers in structured narrative transformations, we investigate how sustainability-oriented computing research is perceived, contested, and can adapt in a post-truth world."
2508.0625,"Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are increasingly proposed for communication and in-orbit computing, achieving low-latency global services. However, their sustainability remains largely unexamined. This paper investigates the carbon footprint of computing in space, focusing on lifecycle emissions from launch over orbital operation to re-entry. We present ESpaS, a lightweight tool for estimating carbon intensities across CPU usage, memory, and networking in orbital vs. terrestrial settings. Three worked examples compare (i) launch technologies (state-of-the-art rocket vs. potential next generation) and (ii) operational emissions of data center workloads in orbit and on the ground. Results show that, even under optimistic assumptions, in-orbit systems incur significantly higher carbon costs - up to an order of magnitude more than terrestrial equivalents - primarily due to embodied emissions from launch and re-entry. Our findings advocate for carbon-aware design principles and regulatory oversight in developing sustainable digital infrastructure in orbit."
2508.06267,"On June 15, 2020, the official data protection impact assessment (DPIA) for the German Corona-Warn-App (CWA) was made publicly available. Shortly thereafter, the app was made available for download in the app stores. However, the first version of the DPIA had significant weaknesses, as this paper argues. However since then, the quality of the official DPIA increased immensely due to interventions and interactions such as an alternative DPIA produced by external experts and extensive public discussions. To illustrate the development and improvement, the initial weaknesses of the official DPIA are documented and analyzed here. For this paper to meaningfully do this, first the purpose of a DPIA is briefly summarized. According to Article 35 of the GDPR, it consists primarily of identifying the risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons. This paper documents at least specific methodological, technical and legal shortcomings of the initial DPIA of the CWA: 1) It only focused on the app itself, neither on the whole processing procedure nor on the infrastructure used. 2) It only briefly touched on the main data protection specific attacker, the processing organization itself. And 3) The discussion of effective safeguards to all risks including such as the ones posed by Google and Apple has only insufficiently been worked out. Finally, this paper outlines the constructive criticism and suggestions uttered, also by the authors of this paper, regarding the initial release. As of now, some of those constructive contributions have been worked into the current DPIA, such as 1) and 2), but some central ones still haven't, such as 3). This paper aims to provide an opportunity to improve the practical knowledge and academic discourse regarding high-quality DPIAs."
2508.06411,"Although discourse around the risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has grown, it often lacks a comprehensive, multidimensional framework, and concrete causal pathways mapping hazard to harm. This paper aims to bridge this gap by examining six commonly discussed AI catastrophic risks: CBRN, cyber offense, sudden loss of control, gradual loss of control, environmental risk, and geopolitical risk. First, we characterize these risks across seven key dimensions, namely intent, competency, entity, polarity, linearity, reach, and order. Next, we conduct risk pathway modeling by mapping step-by-step progressions from the initial hazard to the resulting harms. The dimensional approach supports systematic risk identification and generalizable mitigation strategies, while risk pathway models help identify scenario-specific interventions. Together, these methods offer a more structured and actionable foundation for managing catastrophic AI risks across the value chain."
2508.0647,"The rapid advancement of Generative AI (GenAI) relies heavily on the digital commons, a vast collection of free and open online content that is created, shared, and maintained by communities. However, this relationship is becoming increasingly strained due to financial burdens, decreased contributions, and misalignment between AI models and community norms. As we move deeper into the GenAI era, it is essential to examine the interdependent relationship between GenAI, the long-term sustainability of the digital commons, and the equity of current AI development practices. We highlight five critical questions that require urgent attention: 1. How can we prevent the digital commons from being threatened by undersupply as individuals cease contributing to the commons and turn to Generative AI for information? 2. How can we mitigate the risk of the open web closing due to restrictions on access to curb AI crawlers? 3. How can technical standards and legal frameworks be updated to reflect the evolving needs of organizations hosting common content? 4. What are the effects of increased synthetic content in open knowledge databases, and how can we ensure their integrity? 5. How can we account for and distribute the infrastructural and environmental costs of providing data for AI training? We emphasize the need for more responsible practices in AI development, recognizing the digital commons not only as content but as a collaborative and decentralized form of knowledge governance, which relies on the practice of ""commoning"" - making, maintaining, and protecting shared and open resources. Ultimately, our goal is to stimulate discussion and research on the intersection of Generative AI and the digital commons, with the aim of developing an ""AI commons"" and public infrastructures for AI development that support the long-term health of the digital commons."
2508.06479,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as scalable solutions to the global mental health crisis. But their deployment in psychiatric contexts raises a distinctive ethical concern: the problem of atypicality. Because LLMs generate outputs based on population-level statistical regularities, their responses -- while typically appropriate for general users -- may be dangerously inappropriate when interpreted by psychiatric patients, who often exhibit atypical cognitive or interpretive patterns. We argue that standard mitigation strategies, such as prompt engineering or fine-tuning, are insufficient to resolve this structural risk. Instead, we propose dynamic contextual certification (DCC): a staged, reversible and context-sensitive framework for deploying LLMs in psychiatry, inspired by clinical translation and dynamic safety models from artificial intelligence governance. DCC reframes chatbot deployment as an ongoing epistemic and ethical process that prioritises interpretive safety over static performance benchmarks. Atypicality, we argue, cannot be eliminated -- but it can, and must, be proactively managed."
2508.06563,"Understanding student perceptions of assessment is vital for designing inclusive and effective learning environments, especially in technical education. This study explores engineering students' perceptions of assessment practices in an introductory computer science/ programming course, and its associated laboratory within an Indian engineering institute context. A total of 318 first-year Bachelor of Technology students participated in a weekly 25-statement Likert-scale survey conducted over nine weeks. Using descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis), the analysis reveals that students largely perceive lab assignments as effective learning activities and view exams and projects as authentic and skill-enhancing. Students appreciated the role of instructors in shaping course content and found teaching assistants to be approachable and helpful, despite some inconsistencies. The study also finds significant variations in students' academic performance and assessment perceptions based on prior programming experience, technology familiarity, gender, and academic branch. Notably, the performance data did not follow a Gaussian distribution, challenging common assumptions in grade modeling. A comparative analysis with European cohorts highlights both universal patterns and contextual differences, offering valuable insights for designing inclusive and equitable assessment strategies in programming education."
2508.06572,"The integration of AI tools into programming education has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, transforming the way programming is taught and learned. This paper provides a review of the state-of-the-art AI tools available for teaching and learning programming, particularly in the context of introductory courses. It highlights the challenges on course design, learning objectives, course delivery and formative and summative assessment, as well as the misuse of such tools by the students. We discuss ways of re-designing an existing course, re-shaping assignments and pedagogy to address the current AI technologies challenges. This example can serve as a guideline for policies for institutions and teachers involved in teaching programming, aiming to maximize the benefits of AI tools while addressing the associated challenges and concerns."
2508.06577,"Participatory Budgeting (PB) empowers citizens to propose and vote on public investment projects. Yet, despite its democratic potential, PB initiatives often suffer from low participation rates, limiting their visibility and perceived legitimacy. In this work, we aim to strengthen PB elections in two key ways: by supporting project proposers in crafting better proposals, and by helping PB organizers manage large volumes of submissions in a transparent manner. We propose a privacy-preserving approach to predict which PB proposals are likely to be funded, using only their textual descriptions and anonymous historical voting records -- without relying on voter demographics or personally identifiable information. We evaluate the performance of GPT 4 Turbo in forecasting proposal outcomes across varying contextual scenarios, observing that the LLM's prior knowledge needs to be complemented by past voting data to obtain predictions reflecting real-world PB voting behavior. Our findings highlight the potential of AI-driven tools to support PB processes by improving transparency, planning efficiency, and civic engagement."
2508.06592,"As AI adoption expands across human society, the problem of aligning AI models to match human preferences remains a grand challenge. Currently, the AI alignment field is deeply divided between behavioral and representational approaches, resulting in narrowly aligned models that are more vulnerable to increasingly deceptive misalignment threats. In the face of this fragmentation, we propose an integrated vision for the future of the field. Drawing on related lessons from immunology and cybersecurity, we lay out a set of design principles for the development of Integrated Alignment frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of diverse alignment approaches through deep integration and adaptive coevolution. We highlight the importance of strategic diversity - deploying orthogonal alignment and misalignment detection approaches to avoid homogeneous pipelines that may be ""doomed to success"". We also recommend steps for greater unification of the AI alignment research field itself, through cross-collaboration, open model weights and shared community resources."
2508.0676,"LLM-driven chatbots like ChatGPT have created large volumes of conversational data, but little is known about how user privacy expectations are evolving with this technology. We conduct a survey experiment with 300 US ChatGPT users to understand emerging privacy norms for sharing chatbot data. Our findings reveal a stark disconnect between user concerns and behavior: 82% of respondents rated chatbot conversations as sensitive or highly sensitive - more than email or social media posts - but nearly half reported discussing health topics and over one-third discussed personal finances with ChatGPT. Participants expressed strong privacy concerns (t(299) = 8.5, p < .01) and doubted their conversations would remain private (t(299) = -6.9, p < .01). Despite this, respondents uniformly rejected sharing personal data (search history, emails, device access) for improved services, even in exchange for premium features worth $200. To identify which factors influence appropriate chatbot data sharing, we presented participants with factorial vignettes manipulating seven contextual factors. Linear mixed models revealed that only the transmission factors such as informed consent, data anonymization, or the removal of personally identifiable information, significantly affected perceptions of appropriateness and concern for data access. Surprisingly, contextual factors including the recipient of the data (hospital vs. tech company), purpose (research vs. advertising), type of content, and geographic location did not show significant effects. Our results suggest that users apply consistent baseline privacy expectations to chatbot data, prioritizing procedural safeguards over recipient trustworthiness. This has important implications for emerging agentic AI systems that assume user willingness to integrate personal data across platforms."
2508.06849,"Lived experiences fundamentally shape how individuals interact with AI systems, influencing perceptions of safety, trust, and usability. While prior research has focused on developing techniques to emulate human preferences, and proposed taxonomies to categorize risks (such as psychological harms and algorithmic biases), these efforts have provided limited systematic understanding of lived human experiences or actionable strategies for embedding them meaningfully into the AI development lifecycle. This work proposes a framework for meaningfully integrating lived experience into the design and evaluation of AI systems. We synthesize interdisciplinary literature across lived experience philosophy, human-centered design, and human-AI interaction, arguing that centering lived experience can lead to models that more accurately reflect the retrospective, emotional, and contextual dimensions of human cognition. Drawing from a wide body of work across psychology, education, healthcare, and social policy, we present a targeted taxonomy of lived experiences with specific applicability to AI systems. To ground our framework, we examine three application domains (i) education, (ii) healthcare, and (iii) cultural alignment, illustrating how lived experience informs user goals, system expectations, and ethical considerations in each context. We further incorporate insights from AI system operators and human-AI partnerships to highlight challenges in responsibility allocation, mental model calibration, and long-term system adaptation. We conclude with actionable recommendations for developing experience-centered AI systems that are not only technically robust but also empathetic, context-aware, and aligned with human realities. This work offers a foundation for future research that bridges technical development with the lived experiences of those impacted by AI systems."
2508.07027,"This paper considers Ecogame, an innovative art project of 1970, whose creators believed in a positive vision of a technological future; an understanding, posited on cybernetics, of a future that could be participatory via digital means, and therefore more democratised. Using simulation and early machine learning techniques over a live network, Ecogame combined the power of visual art with cybernetic concepts of adaptation, feedback, and control to propose that behaviour had implications for the total system. It provides an historical precedent for contemporary AI-driven art about using AI in a more human-centred way."
2508.07132,"Based on 230 visualisations, this paper examines the depiction of museum curators by the popular generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) model, ChatGPT4o. While the AI-generated representations do not reiterate popular stereotypes of curators as nerdy, conservative in dress and stuck in time rummaging through collections, they contrast sharply with real-world demographics. AI-generated imagery extremely underrepresents women (3.5% vs 49% to 72% in reality) and disregards ethnic communities other than Caucasian (0% vs 18% to 36%). It only over-represents young curators (79% vs approx. 27%) but also renders curators to resemble yuppie professionals or people featuring in fashion advertising. Stereotypical attributes are prevalent, with curators widely depicted as wearing beards and holding clipboards or digital tablets. The findings highlight biases in the generative AI image creation dataset, which is poised to shape an inaccurate portrayal of museum professionals if the images were to be taken uncritically at face value."
2508.0723,"The label `public interest technology' (PIT) is growing in popularity among those seeking to use `tech for good' - especially among technical practitioners working in civil society and nonprofit organizations. PIT encompasses a broad range of sociotechnical work across professional domains and sectors; however, the trend remains understudied within sociotechnical research. This paper describes a mixed-methods study, designed and conducted by PIT practitioners at the Center for Democracy and Technology, that characterizes technologists within the specific context of civil society, civil rights, and advocacy organizations in North America and Western Europe. We conducted interviews with civil society leaders to investigate how PIT practitioners position the field and themselves, and we held a roundtable discussion bringing diverse voices together to make meaning of this growing phenomenon. Ultimately, we find that PIT remains both defined and plagued by its expansiveness, and that today's civil society public interest technologists see a need for both (a) more robust professionalization infrastructures, including philanthropic attention, and (b) more engaged, coherent community. This study illuminates a nascent intersection of technology and policy on-the-ground that is of growing relevance to critical sociotechnical research on the shifting relationship between computing and society."
2508.07356,"Interoperability is increasingly recognised as a foundational principle for fostering innovation, competition, and user autonomy in the evolving digital ecosystem. Existing research on interoperability predominantly focuses either on technological interoperability itself or on the legal regulations concerning interoperability, with insufficient exploration of their interdisciplinary intersection. This paper compares the technological interoperability in Web 3.0 with the theoretical framework of legal interoperability established by the EU Data Act, analysing the areas of convergence and mismatch. The goal is to align technical interoperability with legal concepts of interoperability, thereby enhancing the practical implementation of systematic interoperability in the next generation of the Web. This study finds that, firstly, Web 3.0's concept of interoperability spans data, systems, and applications, while the Data Act focuses solely on data. This narrow scope risks creating a fragmented ecosystem, where data exchange is possible, but full integration of systems and applications is hindered, leading to inefficiencies, and obstructing seamless data flow across platforms. Secondly, while Web 3.0 technically seeks to achieve interoperability through the integration of entire systems and decentralised applications, the compliance with Data Act might negatively limit such system and application interoperability through its data interoperability provisions. This paper suggests interdisciplinary recommendations to enhance the implementation and enforcement of interoperability. On one hand, the Data Act should broaden its concept of interoperability to encompass both the systems and applications layers. On the other hand, it is advisable to introduce provisions for standardised protocols through soft law mechanisms to address legal shortcomings and keep pace with technological advancements."
2508.07454,"The modern web is increasingly characterized by the pervasiveness of Surveillance Capitalism. This investigation employs an empirical approach to examine this phenomenon through the web tracking practices of major tech companies -- specifically Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft (GAFAM) -- and their relation to financial performance indicators. Using longitudinal data fromthis http URLspanning from 2017 to 2025 and publicly accessible SEC filings, this paper analyzes patterns and trends in web tracking data to establish empirical evidence of Surveillance Capitalism's extraction mechanisms. Our findings reveal Google's omnipresent position on the web, a three-tier stratification among GAFAM companies in the surveillance space, and evidence suggesting an evolution of tracking techniques to evade detection. The investigation further discusses the social and environmental costs of web tracking and how alternative technologies, such as the Gemini protocol, offer pathways to challenge the extractive logic of this new economic order. By closely examining surveillance activities, this research contributes to an ongoing effort to better understand the current state and future trajectory of Surveillance Capitalism."
2508.07507,"Transdisciplinary approaches are increasingly essential for addressing grand societal challenges, particularly in complex domains such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), urban planning, and social sciences. However, effectively validating and integrating knowledge across distinct epistemic and ontological perspectives poses significant difficulties. This article proposes a six-dimensional framework for assessing and strengthening transdisciplinary knowledge validity in AI and city studies, based on an extensive analysis of the most cited research (2014--2024). Specifically, the framework classifies research orientations according to ontological, epistemological, methodological, teleological, axiological, and valorization dimensions. Our findings show a predominance of perspectives aligned with critical realism (ontological), positivism (epistemological), analytical methods (methodological), consequentialism (teleological), epistemic values (axiological), and social/economic valorization. Less common stances, such as idealism, mixed methods, and cultural valorization, are also examined for their potential to enrich knowledge production. We highlight how early career researchers and transdisciplinary teams can leverage this framework to reconcile divergent disciplinary viewpoints and promote socially accountable outcomes."
2508.07872,"Uncertainty in artificial intelligence (AI) predictions poses urgent legal and ethical challenges for AI-assisted decision-making. We examine two algorithmic interventions that act as guardrails for human-AI collaboration: selective abstention, which withholds high-uncertainty predictions from human decision-makers, and selective friction, which delivers those predictions together with salient warnings or disclosures that slow the decision process. Research has shown that selective abstention based on uncertainty can inadvertently exacerbate disparities and disadvantage under-represented groups that disproportionately receive uncertain predictions. In this paper, we provide the first integrated socio-technical and legal analysis of uncertainty-based algorithmic interventions. Through two case studies, AI-assisted consumer credit decisions and AI-assisted content moderation, we demonstrate how the seemingly neutral use of uncertainty thresholds can trigger discriminatory impacts. We argue that, although both interventions pose risks of unlawful discrimination under UK law, selective frictions offer a promising pathway toward fairer and more accountable AI-assisted decision-making by preserving transparency and encouraging more cautious human judgment."
2508.08019,"Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), such as Massive Open Online Courses, offer new opportunities for human learning. At the core of such systems, knowledge tracing (KT) predicts students' future performance by analyzing their historical learning activities, enabling an accurate evaluation of students' knowledge states over time. We show that existing KT methods often encounter correlation conflicts when analyzing the relationships between historical learning sequences and future performance. To address such conflicts, we propose to extract so-called Follow-up Performance Trends (FPTs) from historical ITS data and to incorporate them into KT. We propose a method called Forward-Looking Knowledge Tracing (FINER) that combines historical learning sequences with FPTs to enhance student performance prediction accuracy. FINER constructs learning patterns that facilitate the retrieval of FPTs from historical ITS data in linear time; FINER includes a novel similarity-aware attention mechanism that aggregates FPTs based on both frequency and contextual similarity; and FINER offers means of combining FPTs and historical learning sequences to enable more accurate prediction of student future performance. Experiments on six real-world datasets show that FINER can outperform ten state-of-the-art KT methods, increasing accuracy by 8.74% to 84.85%."
2508.08084,"Over the past decade, Big Tech has faced increasing levels of worker activism. While worker actions have resulted in positive outcomes (e.g., cancellation of Google's Project Dragonfly), such successes have become increasingly infrequent. This is, in part, because corporations have adjusted their strategies to dealing with increased worker activism (e.g., increased retaliation against workers, and contracts clauses that prevent cancellation due to worker pressure). This change in company strategy prompts urgent questions about updating worker strategies for influencing corporate behavior in an industry with vast societal impact. Current discourse on tech worker activism often lacks empirical grounding regarding its scope, history, and strategic calculus. Our work seeks to bridge this gap by firstly conducting a systematic analysis of worker actions at Google and Microsoft reported in U.S. newspapers to delineate their characteristics. We then situate these actions within the long history of labour movements and demonstrate that, despite perceptions of radicalism, contemporary tech activism is comparatively moderate. Finally, we engage directly with current and former tech activists to provide a novel catalogue of potential worker actions, evaluating their perceived risks, impacts, and effectiveness (concurrently publishing ""Tech Workers' Guide to Resistance""). Our findings highlight considerable variation in strategic thinking among activists themselves. We conclude by arguing that the establishment of a radical flank could increase the effectiveness of current movements.""Tech Workers' Guide to Resistance"" can be found atthis https URLorthis https URL"
2508.08143,"Generative AI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini routinely make things up. They ""hallucinate"" historical events and figures, legal cases, academic papers, non-existent tech products and features, biographies, and news articles. Recently, some have argued that these hallucinations are better understood as bullshit. Chatbots produce rich streams of text that look truth-apt without any concern for the truthfulness of what this text says. But can they also gossip? We argue that they can. After some definitions and scene-setting, we focus on a recent example to clarify what AI gossip looks like before considering some distinct harms -- what we call ""technosocial harms"" -- that follow from it."
2508.08193,"A surge of recent work explores the ethical and societal implications of large-scale AI models that make ""moral"" judgments. Much of this literature focuses either on alignment with human judgments through various thought experiments or on the group fairness implications of AI judgments. However, the most immediate and likely use of AI is to help or fully replace the so-called street-level bureaucrats, the individuals deciding to allocate scarce social resources or approve benefits. There is a rich history underlying how principles of local justice determine how society decides on prioritization mechanisms in such domains. In this paper, we examine how well LLM judgments align with human judgments, as well as with socially and politically determined vulnerability scoring systems currently used in the domain of homelessness resource allocation. Crucially, we use real data on those needing services (maintaining strict confidentiality by only using local large models) to perform our analyses. We find that LLM prioritizations are extremely inconsistent in several ways: internally on different runs, between different LLMs, and between LLMs and the vulnerability scoring systems. At the same time, LLMs demonstrate qualitative consistency with lay human judgments in pairwise testing. Findings call into question the readiness of current generation AI systems for naive integration in high-stakes societal decision-making."
2508.08231,"Public-sector bureaucracies seek to reap the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI), but face important concerns about accountability and transparency when using AI systems. In particular, perception or actuality of AI agency might create ethics sinks - constructs that facilitate dissipation of responsibility when AI systems of disputed moral status interface with bureaucratic structures. Here, we reject the notion that ethics sinks are a necessary consequence of introducing AI systems into bureaucracies. Rather, where they appear, they are the product of structural design decisions across both the technology and the institution deploying it. We support this claim via a systematic application of conceptions of moral agency in AI ethics to Weberian bureaucracy. We establish that it is both desirable and feasible to render AI systems as tools for the generation of organizational transparency and legibility, which continue the processes of Weberian rationalization initiated by previous waves of digitalization. We present a three-point Moral Agency Framework for legitimate integration of AI in bureaucratic structures: (a) maintain clear and just human lines of accountability, (b) ensure humans whose work is augmented by AI systems can verify the systems are functioning correctly, and (c) introduce AI only where it doesn't inhibit the capacity of bureaucracies towards either of their twin aims of legitimacy and stewardship. We suggest that AI introduced within this framework can not only improve efficiency and productivity while avoiding ethics sinks, but also improve the transparency and even the legitimacy of a bureaucracy."
2508.08311,"Crossing multiple planetary boundaries places us in a zone of uncertainty that is characterized by considerable fluctuations in climatic events. The situation is exacerbated by the relentless use of resources and energy required to develop digital infrastructures that have become pervasive and ubiquitous. We are bound to these infrastructures, dead technologies and negative commons, just as much as they bind us. Although their growth threatens the necessary reduction of our impact, we have a responsibility to maintain them until we can do without them.In university setting, as well as in any public organization, urban mines per se, we propose an IT architecture based on the exclusive use of unreliable waste from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) as a frugal alternative to the incessant replacement of devices. Powered by renewable energy, autonomous, robust, adaptable, and built on battle-tested open-source software, we envision this solution for a situation where use is bound to decline eventually, to close this damaging technological chapter. Digital technology, the idol of modern times, is to meet its twilight if we do not want to irrevocably alter the critical zone."
2508.08313,"In the face of increasing austerity and threats of AI-enabled labor replacement at the University of Michigan, a group of workers and students have coalesced around the project of ""AI resistance"" since Fall 2024. Forming a cross-departmental coalition including librarians, faculty, staff, graduate workers, and undergraduate students, we have hosted a public workshop questioning the techno-deterministic inevitability of AI use at the University and are working with other campus organizations to maintain an ongoing organizing space. This workshop submission incorporates our reflections thus far on the strategies we've employed, the challenges to collective resistance, and our role as workers in resisting AI within the University. Our aim for this work is to provide concrete inspiration for technologists, students, and staff looking to resist AI techno-solutionism within their own universities."
2508.08314,"While large language models (LLMs) challenge conventional methods of teaching and learning, they present an exciting opportunity to improve efficiency and scale high-quality instruction. One promising application is the generation of customized exams, tailored to specific course content. There has been significant recent excitement on automatically generating questions using artificial intelligence, but also comparatively little work evaluating the psychometric quality of these items in real-world educational settings. Filling this gap is an important step toward understanding generative AI's role in effective test design. In this study, we introduce and evaluate an iterative refinement strategy for question generation, repeatedly producing, assessing, and improving questions through cycles of LLM-generated critique and revision. We evaluate the quality of these AI-generated questions in a large-scale field study involving 91 classes -- covering computer science, mathematics, chemistry, and more -- in dozens of colleges across the United States, comprising nearly 1700 students. Our analysis, based on item response theory (IRT), suggests that for students in our sample the AI-generated questions performed comparably to expert-created questions designed for standardized exams. Our results illustrate the power of AI to make high-quality assessments more readily available, benefiting both teachers and students."
2508.08315,"The paper examines how EU rules in AI, 5G, and cybersecurity operate as transnational governance and shape policy in Guatemala. It outlines the AI Act's risk approach, the 5G Action Plan and Security Toolbox, and the cybersecurity regime built on ENISA, NIS2, the Cybersecurity Act, and the Cyber Resilience Act. It traces extraterritorial channels such as the Brussels effect, private standards, supply chain clauses, and data transfer controls. Guatemala specific impacts include SME compliance costs, procurement limits, environmental trade-offs in rollout, rights risks, and capacity gaps. The paper maps current national measures and proposes five guardrails: digital constitutionalism, green IT duties, third country impact assessment, standards co-design, and recognition of regulatory diversity."
2508.08318,"With the increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all fields and daily activities, a heated debate is found about the advantages and challenges of AI and the need for navigating the concerns associated with AI to make the best of it. To contribute to this literature and the ongoing debate related to it, this study draws on the Monster theory to explain the conflicting representation of AI. It suggests that studying monsters in popular culture can provide an in-depth understanding of AI and its monstrous effects. Specifically, this study aims to discuss AI perception and development through the seven theses of Monster theory. The obtained results revealed that, just like monsters, AI is complex in nature, and it should not be studied as a separate entity but rather within a given society or culture. Similarly, readers may perceive and interpret AI differently, just as readers may interpret monsters differently. The relationship between AI and monsters, as depicted in this study, does not seem to be as odd as it might be at first."
2508.08333,"The conceptual framework proposed in this paper centers on the development of a deliberative moral reasoning system - one designed to process complex moral situations by generating, filtering, and weighing normative arguments drawn from diverse ethical perspectives. While the framework is rooted in Machine Ethics, it also makes a substantive contribution to Value Alignment by outlining a system architecture that links structured moral reasoning to action under time constraints. Grounded in normative moral pluralism, this system is not constructed to imitate behavior but is built on reason-sensitive deliberation over structured moral content in a transparent and principled manner. Beyond its role as a deliberative system, it also serves as the conceptual foundation for a novel two-level architecture: functioning as a moral reasoning teacher envisioned to train faster models that support real-time responsiveness without reproducing the full structure of deliberative reasoning. Together, the deliberative and intuitive components are designed to enable both deep reflection and responsive action. A key design feature is the dual-hybrid structure: a universal layer that defines a moral threshold through top-down and bottom-up learning, and a local layer that learns to weigh competing considerations in context while integrating culturally specific normative content, so long as it remains within the universal threshold. By extending the notion of moral complexity to include not only conflicting beliefs but also multifactorial dilemmas, multiple stakeholders, and the integration of non-moral considerations, the framework aims to support morally grounded decision-making in realistic, high-stakes contexts."
2508.08337,"Social determinants are variables that, while not directly pertaining to any specific individual, capture key aspects of contexts and environments that have direct causal influences on certain attributes of an individual. Previous algorithmic fairness literature has primarily focused on sensitive attributes, often overlooking the role of social determinants. Our paper addresses this gap by introducing formal and quantitative rigor into a space that has been shaped largely by qualitative proposals regarding the use of social determinants. To demonstrate theoretical perspectives and practical applicability, we examine a concrete setting of college admissions, using region as a proxy for social determinants. Our approach leverages a region-based analysis with Gamma distribution parameterization to model how social determinants impact individual outcomes. Despite its simplicity, our method quantitatively recovers findings that resonate with nuanced insights in previous qualitative debates, that are often missed by existing algorithmic fairness approaches. Our findings suggest that mitigation strategies centering solely around sensitive attributes may introduce new structural injustice when addressing existing discrimination. Considering both sensitive attributes and social determinants facilitates a more comprehensive explication of benefits and burdens experienced by individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds as well as contextual environments, which is essential for understanding and achieving fairness effectively and transparently."
2508.08345,"Voluntary commitments are central to international AI governance, as demonstrated by recent voluntary guidelines from the White House to the G7, from Bletchley Park to Seoul. How do major AI companies make good on their commitments? We score companies based on their publicly disclosed behavior by developing a detailed rubric based on their eight voluntary commitments to the White House in 2023. We find significant heterogeneity: while the highest-scoring company (OpenAI) scores a 83% overall on our rubric, the average score across all companies is just 53%. The companies demonstrate systemically poor performance for their commitment to model weight security with an average score of 17%: 11 of the 16 companies receive 0% for this commitment. Our analysis highlights a clear structural shortcoming that future AI governance initiatives should correct: when companies make public commitments, they should proactively disclose how they meet their commitments to provide accountability, and these disclosures should be verifiable. To advance policymaking on corporate AI governance, we provide three directed recommendations that address underspecified commitments, the role of complex AI supply chains, and public transparency that could be applied towards AI governance initiatives worldwide."
2508.08353,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare, but it requires access to health data. Synthetic data that is generated through machine learning models trained on real data, offers a way to share data while preserving privacy. However, uncertainties in the practical application of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) create an administrative burden, limiting the benefits of synthetic data. Through a systematic analysis of relevant legal sources and an empirical study, this article explores whether synthetic data should be classified as personal data under the GDPR. The study investigates the residual identification risk through generating synthetic data and simulating inference attacks, challenging common perceptions of technical identification risk. The findings suggest synthetic data is likely anonymous, depending on certain factors, but highlights uncertainties about what constitutes reasonably likely risk. To promote innovation, the study calls for clearer regulations to balance privacy protection with the advancement of AI in healthcare."
2508.08504,"Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to address social and behavioral determinants of health by transforming labor intensive workflows in resource-constrained settings. Creating LLM-based applications that serve the needs of underserved communities requires a deep understanding of their local context, but it is often the case that neither LLMs nor their developers possess this local expertise, and the experts in these communities often face severe time/resource constraints. This creates a disconnect: how can one engage in meaningful co-design of an LLM-based application for an under-resourced community when the communication channel between the LLM developer and domain expert is constrained? We explored this question through a real-world case study, in which our data science team sought to partner with social workers at a safety net hospital to build an LLM application that summarizes patients' social needs. Whereas prior works focus on the challenge of prompt tuning, we found that the most critical challenge in this setting is the careful and precise specification of \what information to surface to providers so that the LLM application is accurate, comprehensive, and verifiable. Here we present a novel co-design framework for settings with limited access to domain experts, in which the summary generation task is first decomposed into individually-optimizable attributes and then each attribute is efficiently refined and validated through a multi-tier cascading approach."
2508.08544,"As AI becomes more ""agentic,"" it faces technical and socio-legal issues it must address if it is to fulfill its promise of increased economic productivity and efficiency. This paper uses technical and legal perspectives to explain how things change when AI systems start being able to directly execute tasks on behalf of a user. We show how technical conceptions of agents track some, but not all, socio-legal conceptions of agency. That is, both computer science and the law recognize the problems of under-specification for an agent, and both disciplines have robust conceptions of how to address ensuring an agent does what the programmer, or in the law, the principal desires and no more. However, to date, computer science has under-theorized issues related to questions of loyalty and to third parties that interact with an agent, both of which are central parts of the law of agency. First, we examine the correlations between implied authority in agency law and the principle of value-alignment in AI, wherein AI systems must operate under imperfect objective specification. Second, we reveal gaps in the current computer science view of agents pertaining to the legal concepts of disclosure and loyalty, and how failure to account for them can result in unintended effects in AI ecommerce agents. In surfacing these gaps, we show a path forward for responsible AI agent development and deployment."
2508.08573,"AI-powered scarce resource allocation policies rely on predictions to target either specific individuals (e.g., high-risk) or settings (e.g., neighborhoods). Recent research on individual-level targeting demonstrates conflicting results; some models show that targeting is not useful when inequality is high, while other work demonstrates potential benefits. To study and reconcile this apparent discrepancy, we develop a stylized framework based on the Mallows model to understand how the spatial distribution of inequality affects the effectiveness of door-to-door outreach policies. We introduce the RENT (Relative Efficiency of Non-Targeting) metric, which we use to assess the effectiveness of targeting approaches compared with neighborhood-based approaches in preventing tenant eviction when high-risk households are more versus less spatially concentrated. We then calibrate the model parameters to eviction court records collected in a medium-sized city in the USA. Results demonstrate considerable gains in the number of high-risk households canvassed through individually targeted policies, even in a highly segregated metro area with concentrated risks of eviction. We conclude that apparent discrepancies in the prior literature can be reconciled by considering 1) the source of deployment costs and 2) the observed versus modeled concentrations of risk. Our results inform the deployment of AI-based solutions in social service provision that account for particular applications and geographies."
2508.08629,"Due to perceptions of efficiency and significant productivity gains, various organisations, including in education, are adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) into their workflows. Educator-facing, learner-facing, and institution-facing LLMs, collectively, Educational Large Language Models (eLLMs), complement and enhance the effectiveness of teaching, learning, and academic operations. However, their integration into an educational setting raises significant cybersecurity concerns. A comprehensive landscape of contemporary attacks on LLMs and their impact on the educational environment is missing. This study presents a generalised taxonomy of fifty attacks on LLMs, which are categorized as attacks targeting either models or their infrastructure. The severity of these attacks is evaluated in the educational sector using the DREAD risk assessment framework. Our risk assessment indicates that token smuggling, adversarial prompts, direct injection, and multi-step jailbreak are critical attacks on eLLMs. The proposed taxonomy, its application in the educational environment, and our risk assessment will help academic and industrial practitioners to build resilient solutions that protect learners and institutions."
2508.08678,"Computational social experiments, which typically employ agent-based modeling to create testbeds for piloting social experiments, not only provide a computational solution to the major challenges faced by traditional experimental methods, but have also gained widespread attention in various research fields. Despite their significance, their broader impact is largely limited by the underdeveloped intelligence of their core component, i.e., agents. To address this limitation, we develop a framework grounded in well-established social science theories and practices, consisting of three key elements: (i) large language model (LLM)-driven experimental agents, serving as ""silicon participants"", (ii) methods for implementing various interventions or treatments, and (iii) tools for collecting behavioral, survey, and interview data. We evaluate its effectiveness by replicating three representative experiments, with results demonstrating strong alignment, both quantitatively and qualitatively, with real-world evidence. This work provides the first framework for designing LLM-driven agents to pilot social experiments, underscoring the transformative potential of LLMs and their agents in computational social science"
2508.08739,"Many Machine Learning research studies use language that describes potential social benefits or technical affordances of new methods and technologies. Such language, which we call ""social claims"", can help garner substantial resources and influence for those involved in ML research and technology production. However, there exists a gap between social claims and reality (the claim-reality gap): ML methods often fail to deliver the claimed functionality or social impacts. This paper investigates the claim-reality gap and makes a normative argument for developing accountability mechanisms for it. In making the argument, we make three contributions. First, we show why the symptom - absence of social claim accountability - is problematic. Second, we coin dead zone of accountability - a lens that scholars and practitioners can use to identify opportunities for new forms of accountability. We apply this lens to the claim-reality gap and provide a diagnosis by identifying cognitive and structural resistances to accountability in the claim-reality gap. Finally, we offer a prescription - two potential collaborative research agendas that can help create the condition for social claim accountability."
2508.08976,"Natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires increasingly introduce unusual disturbance on economic activities, which are especially likely to reshape commercial land use pattern given their sensitive to customer visitation. However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such complex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under and following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively captured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and calibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict both the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block level under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years. Guided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal attention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory guides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation dynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention module for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a regularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs significantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial land use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19% improvement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided modules was further validated through ablation studies. The research demonstrates that embedding urban theory into commercial land use modeling models may substantially enhance the capacity to capture its gains and losses. These advances in commercial land use modeling contribute to land use research that accounts for cumulative impacts of recurrent disasters and shifts in economic activity patterns."
2508.09007,"This paper introduces the Environmental Justice in Technology (EJIT) Principles, a framework to help reorient technological development toward social and ecological justice and collective flourishing. In response to prevailing models of technological innovation that prioritize speed, scale, and profit while neglecting systemic injustice, the EJIT principles offer an alternative: a set of guiding values that foreground interdependence, repair, and community self-determination. Drawing inspiration from the 1991 principles of environmental justice, this framework extends their commitments into the technological domain, treating environmental justice not as a peripheral concern but as a necessary foundation for building equitable and regenerative futures. We situate the EJIT principles within the broader landscape of environmental justice, design justice, and post-growth computing, proposing them as a values infrastructure for resisting extractive defaults and envisioning technological systems that operate in reciprocity with people and the planet. In doing so, this article aims to support collective efforts to transform not only what technologies we build, but how, why, and for whom."
2508.09036,"The rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) has raised urgent questions across the modern workforce about this new technology's strengths, weaknesses, and capabilities. For privacy professionals, the question is whether these AI systems can provide reliable support on regulatory compliance, privacy program management, and AI governance. In this study, we evaluate ten leading open and closed LLMs, including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, and DeepSeek, by benchmarking their performance on industry-standard certification exams: CIPP/US, CIPM, CIPT, and AIGP from the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). Each model was tested using official sample exams in a closed-book setting and compared to IAPP's passing thresholds. Our findings show that several frontier models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI's GPT-5 consistently achieve scores exceeding the standards for professional human certification - demonstrating substantial expertise in privacy law, technical controls, and AI governance. The results highlight both the strengths and domain-specific gaps of current LLMs and offer practical insights for privacy officers, compliance leads, and technologists assessing the readiness of AI tools for high-stakes data governance roles. This paper provides an overview for professionals navigating the intersection of AI advancement and regulatory risk and establishes a machine benchmark based on human-centric evaluations."
2508.09219,"Recent advances in AI applications have raised growing concerns about the need for ethical guidelines and regulations to mitigate the risks posed by these technologies. In this paper, we present a mixed-method survey study - combining statistical and qualitative analyses - to examine the ethical perceptions, practices, and knowledge of individuals involved in various AI development roles. Our survey includes 414 participants from 43 countries, representing roles such as AI managers, analysts, developers, quality assurance professionals, and information security and privacy experts. The results reveal varying degrees of familiarity and experience with AI ethics principles, government initiatives, and risk mitigation strategies across roles, regions, and other demographic factors. Our findings highlight the importance of a collaborative, role-sensitive approach, involving diverse stakeholders in ethical decision-making throughout the AI development lifecycle. We advocate for developing tailored, inclusive solutions to address ethical challenges in AI development, and we propose future research directions and educational strategies to promote ethics-aware AI practices."
2508.09224,"Large Language Models used in ChatGPT have traditionally been trained to learn a refusal boundary: depending on the user's intent, the model is taught to either fully comply or outright refuse. While this is a strong mitigation for explicitly malicious prompts, focusing safety training on refusals can lead to brittleness for prompts with obscured user intent. Binary refusal boundaries are especially ill-suited for dual-use cases (such as biology or cybersecurity), where a user request can be answered safely at a high level, but in some cases can lead to malicious uplift if sufficiently detailed or actionable. As an alternative, we propose safe-completions: a safety-training approach that centers on the safety of the assistant's output, rather than a binary classification of the user's intent. Safe-completions seek to maximize helpfulness within the safety policy's constraints. We incorporated this approach into GPT-5 and find that across both production comparisons and internally controlled experiments, safe-completion training improves safety (especially on dual-use prompts), reduces the severity of residual safety failures, and substantially increases model helpfulness."
2508.09231,"The field of Explainable AI (XAI) offers a wide range of techniques for making complex models interpretable. Yet, in practice, generating meaningful explanations is a context-dependent task that requires intentional design choices to ensure accessibility and transparency. This paper reframes explanation as a situated design process -- an approach particularly relevant for practitioners involved in building and deploying explainable systems. Drawing on prior research and principles from design thinking, we propose a three-part framework for explanation design in XAI: asking Who needs the explanation, What they need explained, and How that explanation should be delivered. We also emphasize the need for ethical considerations, including risks of epistemic inequality, reinforcing social inequities, and obscuring accountability and governance. By treating explanation as a sociotechnical design process, this framework encourages a context-aware approach to XAI that supports effective communication and the development of ethically responsible explanations."
2508.09293,"The task of ethical Medical Image Synthesis (MISyn) is to ensure that the MISyn techniques are researched and developed ethically throughout their entire lifecycle, which is essential to prevent the negative impacts of MISyn. To address the ever-increasing needs and requirements for ethical practice of MISyn research and development, we first conduct a theoretical analysis that identifies the key properties of ethical MISyn and intrinsic limits of MISyn. We identify that synthetic images lack inherent grounding in real medical phenomena, cannot fully represent the training medical images, and inevitably introduce new distribution shifts and biases.Ethical risks can arise from not acknowledging the intrinsic limits and weaknesses of synthetic images compared to medical images, with the extreme form manifested as misinformation of MISyn that substitutes synthetic images for medical images without acknowledgment. The resulting ethical harms include eroding trust in the medical imaging dataset environment and causing algorithmic discrimination towards stakeholders and the public.To facilitate collective efforts towards ethical MISyn within and outside the medical image analysis community, we then propose practical supports for ethical practice in MISyn based on the theoretical analysis, including ethical practice recommendations that adapt the existing technical standards, problem formulation, design, and evaluation practice of MISyn to the ethical challenges; and oversight recommendations to facilitate checks and balances from stakeholders and the public. We also present two case studies that demonstrate how to apply the ethical practice recommendations in practice, and identify gaps between existing practice and the ethical practice recommendations."
2508.09314,"Dual-submission homework, where students submit work, receive feedback and then revise has gained attention as a way to foster reflection and discourage reliance on online answer repositories. This study analyzes 13 years of exam data from a computer architecture course to compare student performance under single versus dual-submission homework conditions. Using pooled t-tests on matched exam questions, we found that dual-submission significantly improved outcomes in a majority of cases. The results suggest that reflective resubmission can meaningfully enhance learning and may serve as a useful strategy in today's AI-influenced academic environment. This full research paper also discusses pedagogical implications and study limitations."
2508.09853,"Evaluations of dangerous AI capabilities are important for managing catastrophic risks. Public transparency into these evaluations - including what they test, how they are conducted, and how their results inform decisions - is crucial for building trust in AI development. We propose STREAM (A Standard for Transparently Reporting Evaluations in AI Model Reports), a standard to improve how model reports disclose evaluation results, initially focusing on chemical and biological (ChemBio) benchmarks. Developed in consultation with 23 experts across government, civil society, academia, and frontier AI companies, this standard is designed to (1) be a practical resource to help AI developers present evaluation results more clearly, and (2) help third parties identify whether model reports provide sufficient detail to assess the rigor of the ChemBio evaluations. We concretely demonstrate our proposed best practices with ""gold standard"" examples, and also provide a three-page reporting template to enable AI developers to implement our recommendations more easily."
2508.09964,"Synthetic population is an increasingly important material used in numerous areas such as urban and transportation analysis. Traditional methods such as iterative proportional fitting (IPF) is not capable of generating high-quality data when facing datasets with high dimension. Latest population synthesis methods using deep learning techniques can resolve such curse of dimensionality. However, few controls are placed when using these methods, and few of the methods are used to generate synthetic population capturing associations among members in one household. In this study, we propose a framework that tackles these issues. The framework uses a novel population synthesis model, called conditional input directed acyclic tabular generative adversarial network (ciDATGAN), as its core, and a basket of methods are employed to enhance the population synthesis performance. We apply the model to generate a synthetic population for the whole New York State as a public resource for researchers and policymakers. The synthetic population includes nearly 20 million individuals and 7.5 million households. The marginals obtained from the synthetic population match the census marginals well while maintaining similar associations among household members to the sample. Compared to the PUMS data, the synthetic population provides data that is 17% more diverse; when compared against a benchmark approach based on Popgen, the proposed method is 13% more diverse. This study provides an approach that encompasses multiple methods to enhance the population synthesis procedure with greater equity- and diversity-awareness."
2508.1005,"We introduce the concept of ""Legal Zero-Days"" as a novel risk vector for advanced AI systems. Legal Zero-Days are previously undiscovered vulnerabilities in legal frameworks that, when exploited, can cause immediate and significant societal disruption without requiring litigation or other processes before impact. We present a risk model for identifying and evaluating these vulnerabilities, demonstrating their potential to bypass safeguards or impede government responses to AI incidents. Using the 2017 Australian dual citizenship crisis as a case study, we illustrate how seemingly minor legal oversights can lead to large-scale governance disruption. We develop a methodology for creating ""legal puzzles"" as evaluation instruments for assessing AI systems' capabilities to discover such vulnerabilities. Our findings suggest that while current AI models may not reliably find impactful Legal Zero-Days, future systems may develop this capability, presenting both risks and opportunities for improving legal robustness. This work contributes to the broader effort to identify and mitigate previously unrecognized risks from frontier AI systems."
2508.10071,"While research has focused on surfacing and auditing algorithmic bias to ensure equitable AI development, less is known about how NLP practitioners - those directly involved in dataset development, annotation, and deployment - perceive and navigate issues of NLP data equity. This study is among the first to center practitioners' perspectives, linking their experiences to a multi-scalar AI governance framework and advancing participatory recommendations that bridge technical, policy, and community domains. Drawing on a 2024 questionnaire and focus group, we examine how U.S.-based NLP data practitioners conceptualize fairness, contend with organizational and systemic constraints, and engage emerging governance efforts such as the U.S. AI Bill of Rights. Findings reveal persistent tensions between commercial objectives and equity commitments, alongside calls for more participatory and accountable data workflows. We critically engage debates on data diversity and diversity washing, arguing that improving NLP equity requires structural governance reforms that support practitioner agency and community consent."
2508.10198,"Contact tracing has existed in various forms for a very long time. With the rise of COVID-19, the concept has become increasingly important to help slow the spread of the virus. One approach to modernizing contact tracing is to introduce applications that detect all close contacts without individuals having to interact knowingly. 101 United States adults were surveyed in June of 2022 regarding their perceptions and trust of COVID-19 contact tracing applications. We see no definitive correlation between an individual's understanding of privacy protection procedures for contact tracing applications and their willingness to trust such an application. We also see that the release of the application by a private entity like Google-Apple or by a public entity like the United States Federal Government has no significant correlation with a person's trust in the application."
2508.10272,"As ChatGPT and other Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into individuals' daily lives, important research questions arise. What concerns and risks do these systems pose for individual users? What potential harms might they cause, and how can these be mitigated? In this work, we review recent literature and reports, and conduct a comprehensive investigation into these questions. We begin by explaining how LLM-based AI chatbots work, providing essential background to help readers understand chatbots' inherent limitations. We then identify a range of risks associated with individual use of these chatbots, including hallucinations, intrinsic biases, sycophantic behavior, cognitive decline from overreliance, social isolation, and privacy leakage. Finally, we propose several key mitigation strategies to address these concerns. Our goal is to raise awareness of the potential downsides of AI chatbot use, and to empower users to enhance, rather than diminish, human intelligence, to enrich, rather than compromise, daily life."
2508.10733,"Urban traffic simulation is vital in planning, modeling, and analyzing road networks. However, the realism of a simulation depends extensively on the quality of input data. This paper presents an intersection traffic simulation tool that leverages real-world vehicle turning movement count (TMC) data from the City of Toronto to model traffic in an urban environment at an individual or multiple intersections using Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). The simulation performed in this research focuses specifically on intersection-level traffic generation without creating full vehicle routes through the network. This also helps keep the network's complexity to a minimum. The simulated traffic is evaluated against actual data to show that the simulation closely reproduces real intersection flows. This validates that the real data can drive practical simulations, and these scenarios can replace synthetic or random generated data, which is prominently used in developing new traffic-related methodologies. This is the first tool to integrate TMC data from Toronto into SUMO via an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface. This work contributes to the research and traffic planning community on data-driven traffic simulation. It provides transportation engineers with a framework to evaluate intersection design and traffic signal optimization strategies using readily available aggregate traffic data."
2508.10965,"Soil organic carbon is crucial for climate change mitigation and agricultural sustainability. However, understanding its dynamics requires integrating complex, heterogeneous data from multiple sources. This paper introduces the Soil Organic Carbon Knowledge Graph (SOCKG), a semantic infrastructure designed to transform agricultural research data into a queryable knowledge representation. SOCKG features a robust ontological model of agricultural experimental data, enabling precise mapping of datasets from the Agricultural Collaborative Research Outcomes System. It is semantically aligned with the National Agricultural Library Thesaurus for consistent terminology and improved interoperability. The knowledge graph, constructed in GraphDB and Neo4j, provides advanced querying capabilities and RDF access. A user-friendly dashboard allows easy exploration of the knowledge graph and ontology. SOCKG supports advanced analyses, such as comparing soil organic carbon changes across fields and treatments, advancing soil carbon research, and enabling more effective agricultural strategies to mitigate climate change."
2508.11014,"Employment on a societal scale contributes heavily to national and global affairs; consequently, job openings and unemployment estimates provide important information to financial markets and governments alike. However, such reports often describe only the supply (employee job seeker) side of the job market, and skill mismatches are poorly understood. Job postings aggregated on recruiting platforms illuminate marketplace demand, but to date have primarily focused on candidate skills described in their personal profiles. In this paper, we report on a big data approach to estimating job market mismatches by focusing on demand, as represented in publicly available job postings. We use commercially available web scraping tools and a new data processing scheme to build a job posting data set for the semiconductor industry, a strategically critical sector of the United States economy; we focus on Southern California as a central hub of advanced technologies. We report on the employer base and relative needs of various job functions. Our work contributes on three fronts: First, we provide nearly real-time insight into workforce demand; second, we discuss disambiguation and semantic challenges in analysis of employer data bases at scale; and third, we report on the Southern California semiconductor engineering ecosystem."
2508.11067,"The rapid development of AI tools and implementation of LLMs within downstream tasks has been paralleled by a surge in research exploring how the outputs of such AI/LLM systems embed biases, a research topic which was already being extensively explored before the era of ChatGPT. Given the high volume of research around the biases within the outputs of AI systems and LLMs, it is imperative to conduct systematic literature reviews to document throughlines within such research. In this paper, we conduct such a review of research covering AI/LLM bias in four premier venues/organizations -- *ACL, FAccT, NeurIPS, and AAAI -- published over the past 10 years. Through a coverage of 189 papers, we uncover patterns of bias research and along what axes of human identity they commonly focus. The first emergent pattern within the corpus was that 82% (155/189) papers did not establish a working definition of ""bias"" for their purposes, opting instead to simply state that biases and stereotypes exist that can have harmful downstream effects while establishing only mathematical and technical definition of bias. 94 of these 155 papers have been published in the past 5 years, after Blodgett et al. (2020)'s literature review with a similar finding about NLP research and recommendation to consider how such researchers should conceptualize bias, going beyond strictly technical definitions. Furthermore, we find that a large majority of papers -- 79.9% or 151/189 papers -- focus on gender bias (mostly, gender and occupation bias) within the outputs of AI systems and LLMs. By demonstrating a strong focus within the field on gender, race/ethnicity (30.2%; 57/189), age (20.6%; 39/189), religion (19.1%; 36/189) and nationality (13.2%; 25/189) bias, we document how researchers adopt a fairly narrow conception of AI bias by overlooking several non-Western communities in fairness research, as we advocate for a stronger coverage of such populations. Finally, we note that while our corpus contains several examples of innovative debiasing methods across the aforementioned aspects of human identity, only 10.6% (20/189) include recommendations for how to implement their findings or contributions in real-world AI systems or design processes. This indicates a concerning academia-industry gap, especially since many of the biases that our corpus contains several successful mitigation methods that still persist within the outputs of AI systems and LLMs commonly used today. We conclude with recommendations towards future AI/LLM fairness research, with stronger focus on diverse marginalized populations."
2508.11138,"With the rise of social media, rumor detection has drawn increasing attention. Although numerous methods have been proposed with the development of rumor classification datasets, they focus on identifying whether a post is a rumor, lacking the ability to mark the specific rumor content. This limitation largely stems from the lack of fine-grained marks in existing datasets. Constructing a rumor dataset with rumor content information marking is of great importance for fine-grained rumor identification. Such a dataset can facilitate practical applications, including rumor tracing, content moderation, and emergency response. Beyond being utilized for overall performance evaluation, this dataset enables the training of rumor detection algorithms to learn content marking, and thus improves their interpretability and reasoning ability, enabling systems to effectively address specific rumor segments. This paper constructs a dataset for rumor detection with fine-grained markings, named CLMIR (Content-Level Marking Dataset for Identifying Rumors). In addition to determining whether a post is a rumor, this dataset further marks the specific content upon which the rumor is based."
2508.11579,"AI-enhanced scams now employ deepfake technology to produce convincing audio and visual impersonations of trusted family members, often grandchildren, in real time. These attacks fabricate urgent scenarios, such as legal or medical emergencies, to socially engineer older adults into transferring money. The realism of these AI-generated impersonations undermines traditional cues used to detect fraud, making them a powerful tool for financial exploitation. In this study, we explore older adults' perceptions of these emerging threats and their responses, with a particular focus on the role of youth, who may also be impacted by having their identities exploited, in supporting older family members' online safety. We conducted focus groups with 37 older adults (ages 65+) to examine their understanding of deepfake impersonation scams and the value of intergenerational technology support. Findings suggest that older adults frequently rely on trusted relationships to detect scams and develop protective practices. Based on this, we identify opportunities to engage youth as active partners in enhancing resilience across generations."
2508.11662,"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is transforming education, redefining the role of trainers and coaches in learning environments. In our study, we explore how AI integrates into the design process of learning materials, assessing its impact on efficiency, pedagogical quality, and the evolving role of human trainers and coaches. Through qualitative interviews with professionals in education and corporate training, we identify the following key topics: trainers and coaches increasingly act as facilitators and content moderators rather than primary creators, efficiency gains allow for a stronger strategic focus but at the same time the new tools require new skills. Additionally, we analyze how the anthropomorphism of AI shapes user trust and expectations. From these insights, we derive how tools based on GenAI can successfully be implemented for trainers and coaches on an individual, organizational, systemic, and strategic level."
2508.11677,"Peer grading has emerged as a scalable solution for assessment in large and online classrooms, offering both logistical efficiency and pedagogical value. However, designing effective peer-grading systems remains challenging due to persistent concerns around accuracy, fairness, reliability, and student engagement. This paper presents a systematic review of 122 peer-reviewed studies on peer grading spanning over four decades. Drawing from this literature, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes peer grading systems along two key dimensions: (1) evaluation approaches and (2) reviewer weighting strategies. We analyze how different design choices impact grading accuracy, fairness, student workload, and learning outcomes. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each method. Notably, we found that formative feedback -- often regarded as the most valuable aspect of peer assessment -- is seldom incorporated as a quality-based weighting factor in summative grade synthesis techniques. Furthermore, no single reviewer weighting strategy proves universally optimal; each has its trade-offs. Hybrid strategies that combine multiple techniques could show the greatest promise. Our taxonomy offers a practical framework for educators and researchers aiming to design peer grading systems that are accurate, equitable, and pedagogically meaningful."
2508.11678,"Peer assessment has established itself as a critical pedagogical tool in academic settings, offering students timely, high-quality feedback to enhance learning outcomes. However, the efficacy of this approach depends on two factors: (1) the strategic allocation of reviewers and (2) the number of reviews per artifact. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 87 studies (2010--2024) to investigate how reviewer-assignment strategies and the number of reviews per submission impact the accuracy, fairness, and educational value of peer assessment. We identified four common reviewer-assignment strategies: random assignment, competency-based assignment, social-network-based assignment, and bidding. Drawing from both quantitative data and qualitative insights, we explored the trade-offs involved in each approach. Random assignment, while widely used, often results in inconsistent grading and fairness concerns. Competency-based strategies can address these issues. Meanwhile, social and bidding-based methods have the potential to improve fairness and timeliness -- existing empirical evidence is limited. In terms of review count, assigning three reviews per submission emerges as the most common practice. A range of three to five reviews per student or per submission is frequently cited as a recommended spot that balances grading accuracy, student workload, learning outcomes, and engagement."
2508.11681,"There is, in some quarters, concern about high-level machine intelligence and superintelligent AI coming up in a few decades, bringing with it significant risks for humanity. In other quarters, these issues are ignored or considered science fiction. We wanted to clarify what the distribution of opinions actually is, what probability the best experts currently assign to high-level machine intelligence coming up within a particular time-frame, which risks they see with that development, and how fast they see these developing. We thus designed a brief questionnaire and distributed it to four groups of experts in 2012/2013. The median estimate of respondents was for a one in two chance that high-level machine intelligence will be developed around 2040-2050, rising to a nine in ten chance by 2075. Experts expect that systems will move on to superintelligence in less than 30 years thereafter. They estimate the chance is about one in three that this development turns out to be 'bad' or 'extremely bad' for humanity."
2508.11683,"Poor posture has become an increasingly prevalent concern due to students and workers spending extended amounts of time sitting at a desk. To address this issue, we developed PoseTrack, a mobile application that uses a Raspberry Pi Camera and Mediapipe Pose landmarks to monitor the userś posture and provide real time feedback. The system detects poor posture, including forward lean, slouching, hunched shoulders, crossed legs, etc. Some challenges we faced were obtaining posture data, transferring data from the Raspberry Pi to the App, and safely storing user data. We used a Flask server to pass data from the Raspberry Pi to the mobile application, Firebase to store user data, and the Flutter framework to create the app. To test the analysis system viability, we designed an experiment that tested the system accuracy across several different perspectives and postures. The results indicate that the system is able to effectively detect poor posture whenever the userś joints are not blocked by the table or their limbs. The results demonstrate the potential for the system to be further improved and used on a larger scale for poor posture monitoring."
2508.1169,"Child safety continues to be a paramount concern worldwide, with child abduction posing significant threats to communities. This paper presents the development of an edge-based child abduction detection and alert system utilizing a multi-agent framework where each agent incorporates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deployed on a Raspberry Pi. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of VLMs within individual agents of a multi-agent team, our system is trained to accurately detect and interpret complex interactions involving children in various environments in real-time. The multi-agent system is deployed on a Raspberry Pi connected to a webcam, forming an edge device capable of processing video feeds, thereby reducing latency and enhancing privacy. An integrated alert system utilizes the Twilio API to send immediate SMS and WhatsApp notifications, including calls and messages, when a potential child abduction event is detected. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves high accuracy in detecting potential abduction scenarios, with near real-time performance suitable for practical deployment. The multi-agent architecture enhances the system's ability to process complex situational data, improving detection capabilities over traditional single-model approaches. The edge deployment ensures scalability and cost-effectiveness, making it accessible for widespread use. The proposed system offers a proactive solution to enhance child safety through continuous monitoring and rapid alerting, contributing a valuable tool in efforts to prevent child abductions."
2508.11694,"We study how musicians use artificial intelligence (AI) across formats like singles, albums, performances, installations, voices, ballets, operas, or soundtracks. We collect 337 music artworks and categorize them based on AI usage: AI composition, co-composition, sound design, lyrics generation, and translation. We find that AI is employed as a co-creative tool, as an artistic medium, and in live performances and installations. Innovative uses of AI include exploring uncanny aesthetics, multilingual and multigenre song releases, and new formats such as online installations. This research provides a comprehensive overview of current AI music practices, offering insights into emerging artistic trends and the challenges faced by AI musicians."
2508.11698,"In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools across numerous domains, impacting how professionals approach complex analytical tasks. This systematic mapping study comprehensively examines the application of LLMs throughout the Data Science lifecycle. By analyzing relevant papers from Scopus and IEEE databases, we identify and categorize the types of LLMs being applied, the specific stages and tasks of the data science process they address, and the methodological approaches used for their evaluation. Our analysis includes a detailed examination of evaluation metrics employed across studies and systematically documents both positive contributions and limitations of LLMs when applied to data science workflows. This mapping provides researchers and practitioners with a structured understanding of the current landscape, highlighting trends, gaps, and opportunities for future research in this rapidly evolving intersection of LLMs and data science."
2508.11699,"Whether and how to govern AI is no longer a question of technical regulation. It is a question of constitutional authority. Across jurisdictions, algorithmic systems now perform functions once reserved to public institutions: allocating welfare, determining legal status, mediating access to housing, employment, and healthcare. These are not merely administrative operations. They are acts of rule. Yet the dominant models of AI governance fail to confront this reality. The European approach centers on rights-based oversight, presenting its regulatory framework as a principled defense of human dignity. The American model relies on decentralized experimentation, treating fragmentation as a proxy for democratic legitimacy. Both, in different ways, evade the structural question: who authorizes algorithmic power, through what institutions, and on what terms. This Article offers an alternative. Drawing from early modern Reformed political thought, it reconstructs a constitutional framework grounded in covenantal authority and the right of lawful resistance. It argues that algorithmic governance must rest on three principles. First, that all public power must be lawfully delegated through participatory authorization. Second, that authority must be structured across representative communities with the standing to consent, contest, or refuse. Third, that individuals retain a constitutional right to resist systems that impose orthodoxy or erode the domain of conscience. These principles are then operationalized through doctrinal analysis of federalism, nondelegation, compelled speech, and structural accountability. On this view, the legitimacy of algorithmic governance turns not on procedural safeguards or policy design, but on whether it reflects a constitutional order in which power is authorized by the governed, constrained by law, and answerable to those it affects."
2508.11704,"This paper explores integrating microlearning strategies into university curricula, particularly in computer science education, to counteract the decline in class attendance and engagement in US universities after COVID. As students increasingly opt for remote learning and recorded lectures, traditional educational approaches struggle to maintain engagement and effectiveness. Microlearning, which breaks complex subjects into manageable units, is proposed to address shorter attention spans and enhance educational outcomes. It uses interactive formats such as videos, quizzes, flashcards, and scenario-based exercises, which are especially beneficial for topics like algorithms and programming logic requiring deep understanding and ongoing practice. Adoption of microlearning is often limited by the effort needed to create such materials. This paper proposes leveraging AI tools, specifically ChatGPT, to reduce the workload for educators by automating the creation of supplementary materials. While AI can automate certain tasks, educators remain essential in guiding and shaping the learning process. This AI-enhanced approach ensures course content is kept current with the latest research and technology, with educators providing context and insights. By examining AI capabilities in microlearning, this study shows the potential to transform educational practices and outcomes in computer science, offering a practical model for combining advanced technology with established teaching methods."
2508.11705,"The quick growth of shops using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has changed digital marketing activities and changed how businesses interact and reach their consumers. (AI) techniques are reshaping digital interactions between shops and consumers interact digitally by providing a more efficient and customized experience, fostering deeper engagement and more informed decision-making. This study investigates how (AI) techniques affect consumer interaction and decision-making over purchases with shops that use digital marketing. The partial least squares method was used to evaluate data from a survey with 300 respondents. When consumer engagement mediates this relationship, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have a more favorable impact on purchasing decision-making. Consequently, decision-making is positively impacted through consumer engagement. The findings emphasize that for a bigger impact of the (AI) techniques on decision-making, the consumer must initially interact with the (AI) techniques. This research unveils a contemporary pathway in the field of AI-supported shop engagements and illustrates the distinct impact of (AI) techniques on consumer satisfaction, trust, and loyalty, revolutionizing traditional models of customer-purchase decision-making and shop engagement processes. This study provides previously unheard-of insight, into the revolutionary potential of (AI) techniques in influencing customer behavior and shop relationships"
2508.11707,"Traditional end-of-quarter surveys often fail to provide instructors with timely, detailed, and actionable feedback about their teaching. In this paper, we explore how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered chatbots can reimagine the classroom feedback process by engaging students in reflective, conversational dialogues. Through the design and deployment of a three-part system-PromptDesigner, FeedbackCollector, and FeedbackAnalyzer-we conducted a pilot study across two graduate courses at UC Santa Cruz. Our findings suggest that LLM-based feedback systems offer richer insights, greater contextual relevance, and higher engagement compared to standard survey tools. Instructors valued the system's adaptability, specificity, and ability to support mid-course adjustments, while students appreciated the conversational format and opportunity for elaboration. We conclude by discussing the design implications of using AI to facilitate more meaningful and responsive feedback in higher education."
2508.11708,"Urban centers undergo social, demographic, and cultural changes that shape public street use and require systematic evaluation of public spaces. This study presents Street Review, a mixed-methods approach that combines participatory research with AI-based analysis to assess streetscape inclusivity. In Montréal, Canada, 28 residents participated in semi-directed interviews and image evaluations, supported by the analysis of approximately 45,000 street-view images from Mapillary. The approach produced visual analytics, such as heatmaps, to correlate subjective user ratings with physical attributes like sidewalk, maintenance, greenery, and seating. Findings reveal variations in perceptions of inclusivity and accessibility across demographic groups, demonstrating that incorporating diverse user feedback can enhance machine learning models through careful data-labeling and co-production strategies. The Street Review framework offers a systematic method for urban planners and policy analysts to inform planning, policy development, and management of public streets."
2508.11709,"The rapid integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into higher education presents both opportunities and challenges for assessment design, particularly within Project-Based Assessment (PBA) contexts. Traditional assessment methods often emphasise the final product in the PBA, which can now be significantly influenced or created by GenAI tools, raising concerns regarding product authenticity, academic integrity, and learning validation. This paper advocates for a reimagined assessment model for Project-Based Learning (PBL) or a capstone project that prioritises process-oriented evaluation, multi-modal and multifaceted assessment design, and ethical engagement with GenAI to enable higher-order thinking. The model also emphasises the use of (GenAI-assisted) personalised feedback by a supervisor as an observance of the learning process during the project lifecycle. A use case scenario is provided to illustrate the application of the model in a capstone project setting. The paper concludes with recommendations for educators and curriculum designers to ensure that assessment practices remain robust, learner-centric, and integrity-driven in the evolving landscape of GenAI."
2508.11713,"Employment inclusion of people with disabilities remains critically low in Italy, with only 3.5% employed nationally despite mandatory hiring quotas. Traditional manual matching processes require 30-60 minutes per candidate, creating bottlenecks that limit service capacity. Our goal is to develop and validate a production-ready machine learning system for disability employment matching that integrates social responsibility requirements while maintaining human oversight in decision-making. We employed participatory requirements engineering with Centro per l'Impiego di Villafranca di Verona professionals. The system implements a seven-model ensemble with parallel hyperparameter optimization using Optuna. Multi-dimensional scoring combines semantic compatibility, geographic distance, and employment readiness assessment. The system achieves 90.1% F1-score and sub-100ms response times while processing 500,000 candidate-company combinations in under 10 minutes. Expert validation confirms 60-100% capacity increases for employment centers. The LightGBM ensemble shows optimal performance with 94.6-second training time. Thus, advanced AI systems can successfully integrate social responsibility requirements without compromising technical performance. The participatory design methodology provides a replicable framework for developing ethical AI applications in sensitive social domains. The complete system, including source code, documentation, and deployment guides, is openly available to facilitate replication and adaptation by other regions and countries facing similar challenges."
2508.11719,"This chapter starts with a sketch of how we got to ""generative AI"" (GenAI) and a brief summary of the various impacts it had so far. It then discusses some of the opportunities of GenAI, followed by the challenges and dangers, including dystopian outcomes resulting from using uncontrolled machine learning and our failures to understand the results. It concludes with some suggestions for how to control GenAI and address its dangers."
2508.11729,"This paper examines how competing sociotechnical imaginaries of artificial intelligence (AI) risk shape governance decisions and regulatory constraints. Drawing on concepts from science and technology studies, we analyse three dominant narrative groups: existential risk proponents, who emphasise catastrophic AGI scenarios; accelerationists, who portray AI as a transformative force to be unleashed; and critical AI scholars, who foreground present-day harms rooted in systemic inequality. Through an analysis of representative manifesto-style texts, we explore how these imaginaries differ across four dimensions: normative visions of the future, diagnoses of the present social order, views on science and technology, and perceived human agency in managing AI risks. Our findings reveal how these narratives embed distinct assumptions about risk and have the potential to progress into policy-making processes by narrowing the space for alternative governance approaches. We argue against speculative dogmatism and for moving beyond deterministic imaginaries toward regulatory strategies that are grounded in pragmatism."
2508.11738,"Rural healthcare faces persistent challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, workforce shortages, and socioeconomic disparities that hinder access to essential services. This study investigates the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing these issues in underserved rural areas. We systematically reviewed 109 studies published between 2019 and 2024 from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus. Articles were screened using PRISMA guidelines and Covidence software. A thematic analysis was conducted to identify key patterns and insights regarding AI implementation in rural healthcare delivery. The findings reveal significant promise for AI applications, such as predictive analytics, telemedicine platforms, and automated diagnostic tools, in improving healthcare accessibility, quality, and efficiency. Among these, advanced AI systems, including Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), offer particularly transformative potential. MFMs integrate diverse data sources, such as imaging, clinical records, and bio signals, to support comprehensive decision-making, while LLMs facilitate clinical documentation, patient triage, translation, and virtual assistance. Together, these technologies can revolutionize rural healthcare by augmenting human capacity, reducing diagnostic delays, and democratizing access to expertise. However, barriers remain, including infrastructural limitations, data quality concerns, and ethical considerations. Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary collaboration, investment in digital infrastructure, and the development of regulatory frameworks. This review offers actionable recommendations and highlights areas for future research to ensure equitable and sustainable integration of AI in rural healthcare systems."
2508.11872,"In practical teaching, we observe that few students thoroughly read or fully comprehend the information provided in traditional, text-based course syllabi. As a result, essential details, such as course policies and learning outcomes, are frequently overlooked. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach leveraging AI-generated singing and virtual avatars to present syllabi in a format that is more visually appealing, engaging, and memorable. Especially, we leveraged the open-source tool, HeyGem, to transform textual syllabi into audiovisual presentations, in which digital avatars perform the syllabus content as songs. The proposed approach aims to stimulate students' curiosity, foster emotional connection, and enhance retention of critical course information. Student feedback indicated that AI-sung syllabi significantly improved awareness and recall of key course information."
2508.11873,"Business interview preparation demands both solid theoretical grounding and refined soft skills, yet conventional classroom methods rarely deliver the individualized, culturally aware practice employers currently expect. This paper introduces SimInterview, a large language model (LLM)-based simulated multilingual interview training system designed for business professionals entering the AI-transformed labor market. Our system leverages an LLM agent and synthetic AI technologies to create realistic virtual recruiters capable of conducting personalized, real-time conversational interviews. The framework dynamically adapts interview scenarios using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to match individual resumes with specific job requirements across multiple languages. Built on LLMs (OpenAI o3, Llama 4 Maverick, Gemma 3), integrated with Whisper speech recognition, GPT-SoVITS voice synthesis, Ditto diffusion-based talking head generation model, and ChromaDB vector databases, our system significantly improves interview readiness across English and Japanese markets. Experiments with university-level candidates show that the system consistently aligns its assessments with job requirements, faithfully preserves resume content, and earns high satisfaction ratings, with the lightweight Gemma 3 model producing the most engaging conversations. Qualitative findings revealed that the standardized Japanese resume format improved document retrieval while diverse English resumes introduced additional variability, and they highlighted how cultural norms shape follow-up questioning strategies. Finally, we also outlined a contestable AI design that can explain, detect bias, and preserve human-in-the-loop to meet emerging regulatory expectations."
2508.12013,"The rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT has significantly reshaped education, sparking debates about their impact on learning outcomes and academic integrity. While prior research highlights opportunities and risks, there remains a lack of quantitative analysis of student behavior when completing assignments. Understanding how these tools influence real-world academic practices, particularly assignment preparation, is a pressing and timely research priority.This study addresses this gap by analyzing survey responses from 388 university students, primarily from Russia, including a subset of international participants. Using the XGBoost algorithm, we modeled predictors of ChatGPT usage in academic assignments. Key predictive factors included learning habits, subject preferences, and student attitudes toward AI. Our binary classifier demonstrated strong predictive performance, achieving 80.1\% test accuracy, with 80.2\% sensitivity and 79.9\% specificity. The multiclass classifier achieved 64.5\% test accuracy, 64.6\% weighted precision, and 64.5\% recall, with similar training scores, indicating potential data scarcity challenges.The study reveals that frequent use of ChatGPT for learning new concepts correlates with potential overreliance, raising concerns about long-term academic independence. These findings suggest that while generative AI can enhance access to knowledge, unchecked reliance may erode critical thinking and originality. We propose discipline-specific guidelines and reimagined assessment strategies to balance innovation with academic rigor. These insights can guide educators and policymakers in ethically and effectively integrating AI into education."
2508.12045,"Nudge strategies are effective tools for influencing behaviour, but their impact depends on individual preferences. Strategies that work for some individuals may be counterproductive for others. We hypothesize that large language models (LLMs) can facilitate the design of individual-specific nudges without the need for costly and time-intensive behavioural data collection and modelling. To test this, we use LLMs to design personalized decoy-based nudges tailored to individual profiles and cultural contexts, aimed at encouraging air travellers to voluntarily offset CO$_2$ emissions from flights. We evaluate their effectiveness through a large-scale survey experiment ($n=3495$) conducted across five countries. Results show that LLM-informed personalized nudges are more effective than uniform settings, raising offsetting rates by 3-7$\%$ in Germany, Singapore, and the US, though not in China or India. Our study highlights the potential of LLM as a low-cost testbed for piloting nudge strategies. At the same time, cultural heterogeneity constrains their generalizability underscoring the need for combining LLM-based simulations with targeted empirical validation."
2508.12168,"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has positioned data governance as a critical concern for responsible AI development. While frameworks exist for conventional AI systems, the potential emergence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) presents unprecedented governance challenges. This paper examines data governance challenges specific to AGI, defined as systems capable of recursive self-improvement or self-replication. We identify seven key issues that differentiate AGI governance from current approaches. First, AGI may autonomously determine what data to collect and how to use it, potentially circumventing existing consent mechanisms. Second, these systems may make data retention decisions based on internal optimization criteria rather than human-established principles. Third, AGI-to-AGI data sharing could occur at speeds and complexities beyond human oversight. Fourth, recursive self-improvement creates unique provenance tracking challenges, as systems evolve both themselves and how they process data. Fifth, ownership of data and insights generated through self-improvement raises complex intellectual property questions. Sixth, self-replicating AGI distributed across jurisdictions would create unprecedented challenges for enforcing data protection laws. Finally, governance frameworks established during early AGI development may quickly become obsolete as systems evolve. We conclude that effective AGI data governance requires built-in constraints, continuous monitoring mechanisms, dynamic governance structures, international coordination, and multi-stakeholder involvement. Without forward-looking governance approaches specifically designed for systems with autonomous data capabilities, we risk creating AGI whose relationship with data evolves in ways that undermine human values and interests."
2508.12174,"This position paper argues that embedding the legal ""reasonable person"" standard in municipal AI systems is essential for democratic and sustainable urban governance. As cities increasingly deploy artificial intelligence (AI) systems, concerns around equity, accountability, and normative legitimacy are growing. This paper introduces the Urban Reasonableness Layer (URL), a conceptual framework that adapts the legal ""reasonable person"" standard for supervisory oversight in municipal AI systems, including potential future implementations of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Drawing on historical analogies, scenario mapping, and participatory norm-setting, we explore how legal and community-derived standards can inform AI decision-making in urban contexts. Rather than prescribing a fixed solution, the URL is proposed as an exploratory architecture for negotiating contested values, aligning automation with democratic processes, and interrogating the limits of technical alignment. Our key contributions include: (1) articulating the conceptual and operational architecture of the URL; (2) specifying participatory mechanisms for dynamic normative threshold-setting; (3) presenting a comparative scenario analysis of governance trajectories; and (4) outlining evaluation metrics and limitations. This work contributes to ongoing debates on urban AI governance by foregrounding pluralism, contestability, and the inherently political nature of socio-technical systems."
2508.123,"We have convinced ourselves that the way to make AI safe is to make it unsafe. Since 2022, policymakers worldwide have embraced the Regulation Sacrifice - the belief that dismantling safety oversight will deliver security through AI dominance. Fearing China or USA will gain advantage, nations rush to eliminate safeguards that might slow progress. This Essay reveals the fatal flaw: though AI poses national security challenges, the solution demands stronger regulatory frameworks, not weaker ones. A race without guardrails breeds shared danger, not competitive strength. The Regulation Sacrifice makes three false promises. First, it promises durable technological leads. But AI capabilities spread rapidly - performance gaps between U.S. and Chinese systems collapsed from 9 percent to 2 percent in thirteen months. When advantages evaporate in months, sacrificing permanent safety for temporary speed makes no sense. Second, it promises deregulation accelerates innovation. The opposite often proves true. Companies report well-designed governance streamlines development. Investment flows toward regulated markets. Clear rules reduce uncertainty; uncertain liability creates paralysis. Environmental standards did not kill the auto industry; they created Tesla and BYD. Third, enhanced national security through deregulation actually undermines security across all timeframes. Near term: it hands adversaries information warfare tools. Medium term: it democratizes bioweapon capabilities. Long term: it guarantees deployment of uncontrollable AGI systems. The Regulation Sacrifice persists because it serves powerful interests, not security. Tech companies prefer freedom to accountability. Politicians prefer simple stories to complex truths. This creates mutually assured deregulation, where each nation's sprint for advantage guarantees collective vulnerability. The only way to win is not to play."
2508.12389,"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into healthcare systems in low-resource settings, such as Nepal and Ghana, presents transformative opportunities to improve personalized patient care, optimize resources, and address medical professional shortages. This paper presents a survey-based evaluation and insights from Nepal and Ghana, highlighting major obstacles such as data privacy, reliability, and trust issues. Quantitative and qualitative field studies reveal critical metrics, including 85% of respondents identifying ethical oversight as a key concern, and 72% emphasizing the need for localized governance structures. Building on these findings, we propose a draft Responsible AI (RAI) Framework tailored to resourceconstrained environments in these countries. Key elements of the framework include ethical guidelines, regulatory compliance mechanisms, and contextual validation approaches to mitigate bias and ensure equitable healthcare outcomes."
2508.12998,"Urban greenery is often linked to better health, yet findings from past research have been inconsistent. One reason is that official greenery metrics measure the amount or nearness of greenery but ignore how often people actually may potentially see or use it in daily life. To address this gap, we introduced a new classification that separates on-road greenery, which people see while walking through streets, from off-road greenery, which requires planned visits. We did so by combining aerial imagery of Greater London and greenery data from OpenStreetMap with quantified greenery from over 100,000 Google Street View images and accessibility estimates based on 160,000 road segments. We linked these measures to 7.45 billion medical prescriptions issued by the National Health Service and processed through our methodology. These prescriptions cover five conditions: diabetes, hypertension, asthma, depression, and anxiety, as well as opioid use. As hypothesized, we found that green on-road was more strongly linked to better health than four widely used official measures. For example, hypertension prescriptions dropped by 3.68% in wards with on-road greenery above the median citywide level compared to those below it. If all below-median wards reached the citywide median in on-road greenery, prescription costs could fall by up to £3.15 million each year. These results suggest that greenery seen in daily life may be more relevant than public yet secluded greenery, and that official metrics commonly used in the literature have important limitations."
2508.13179,"This paper maps Africa's distinctive AI risk profile, from deepfake fuelled electoral interference and data colonial dependency to compute scarcity, labour disruption and disproportionate exposure to climate driven environmental costs. While major benefits are promised to accrue, the availability, development and adoption of AI also mean that African people and countries face particular AI safety risks, from large scale labour market disruptions to the nefarious use of AI to manipulate public opinion. To date, African perspectives have not been meaningfully integrated into global debates and processes regarding AI safety, leaving African stakeholders with limited influence over the emerging global AI safety governance agenda. While there are Computer Incident Response Teams on the continent, none hosts a dedicated AI Safety Institute or office. We propose a five-point action plan centred on (i) a policy approach that foregrounds the protection of the human rights of those most vulnerable to experiencing the harmful socio-economic effects of AI; (ii) the establishment of an African AI Safety Institute; (iii) promote public AI literacy and awareness; (iv) development of early warning system with inclusive benchmark suites for 25+ African languages; and (v) an annual AU-level AI Safety & Security Forum."
2508.13185,"This study examines the impact of Digital-GenAI-Enhanced Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in DevOps on sustainable innovation performance among Chinese A-share internet technology firms. Using panel data from 2018-2024, we analyze 5,560 firm-year observations from CNRDS and CSMAR databases. Our empirical framework reveals significant positive associations between AI-enhanced HCI implementation and sustainable innovation outcomes. Results demonstrate that firms adopting advanced HCI technologies achieve 23.7% higher innovation efficiency. The study contributes to understanding digital transformation's role in sustainable business practices. We identify three key mechanisms: operational efficiency enhancement, knowledge integration facilitation, and stakeholder engagement improvement. Findings provide practical implications for technology adoption strategies in emerging markets"
2508.13187,"Homelessness is a persistent social challenge, impacting millions worldwide. Over 770,000 people experienced homelessness in the U.S. in 2024. Social stigmatization is a significant barrier to alleviation, shifting public perception, and influencing policymaking. Given that online and city council discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable insights to identify and track social biases. This research contributes to alleviating homelessness by acting on public opinion. It introduces novel methods, building on natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs), to identify and measure PEH social bias expressed in digital spaces. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-modal dataset compiled from Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes across 10 U.S. cities. This unique dataset provides evidence of the typologies of homelessness bias described in the literature. In order to scale up and automate the detection of homelessness bias online, we evaluate LLMs as classifiers. We applied both zero-shot and few-shot classification techniques to this data. We utilized local LLMs (Llama 3.2 3B Instruct, Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct, and Phi4 Instruct Mini) as well as closed-source API models (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok-4). Our findings reveal that although there are significant inconsistencies in local LLM zero-shot classification, the in-context learning classification scores of local LLMs approach the classification scores of closed-source LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs outperform BERT when averaging across all categories. This work aims to raise awareness about the pervasive bias against PEH, develop new indicators to inform policy, and ultimately enhance the fairness and ethical application of Generative AI technologies."
2508.13217,"The increasing burden of responding to large volumes of patient messages has become a key factor contributing to physician burnout. Generative AI (GenAI) shows great promise to alleviate this burden by automatically drafting patient message replies. The ethical implications of this use have however not been fully explored. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a semi-structured interview study with 21 physicians who participated in a GenAI pilot program. We found that notable ethical considerations expressed by the physician participants included human oversight as ethical safeguard, transparency and patient consent of AI use, patient misunderstanding of AI's role, and patient privacy and data security as prerequisites. Additionally, our findings suggest that the physicians believe the ethical responsibility of using GenAI in this context primarily lies with users, not with the technology. These findings may provide useful insights into guiding the future implementation of GenAI in clinical practice."
2508.13218,"Curriculum analytics (CA) studies curriculum structure and student data to ensure the quality of educational programs. An essential aspect is studying course properties, which involves assigning each course a representative difficulty value. This is critical for several aspects of CA, such as quality control (e.g., monitoring variations over time), course comparisons (e.g., articulation), and course recommendation (e.g., advising). Measuring course difficulty requires careful consideration of multiple factors: First, when difficulty measures are sensitive to the performance level of enrolled students, it can bias interpretations by overlooking student diversity. By assessing difficulty independently of enrolled students' performances, we can reduce the risk of bias and enable fair, representative assessments of difficulty. Second, from a measurement theoretic perspective, the measurement must be reliable and valid to provide a robust basis for subsequent analyses. Third, difficulty measures should account for covariates, such as the characteristics of individual students within a diverse populations (e.g., transfer status). In recent years, various notions of difficulty have been proposed. This paper provides the first comprehensive review and comparison of existing approaches for assessing course difficulty based on grade point averages and latent trait modeling. It further offers a hands-on tutorial on model selection, assumption checking, and practical CA applications. These applications include monitoring course difficulty over time and detecting courses with disparate outcomes between distinct groups of students (e.g., dropouts vs. graduates), ultimately aiming to promote high-quality, fair, and equitable learning experiences. To support further research and application, we provide an open-source software package and artificial datasets, facilitating reproducibility and adoption."
2508.1344,"Consumer agency in the digital age is increasingly constrained by systemic barriers and algorithmic manipulation, raising concerns about the authenticity of consumption choices. Nowadays, financial decisions are shaped by external pressures like obligatory consumption, algorithmic persuasion, and unstable work schedules that erode financial autonomy. Obligatory consumption (like hidden fees) is intensified by digital ecosystems. Algorithmic tactics like personalized recommendations lead to impulsive purchases. Unstable work schedules also undermine financial planning. Thus, it is important to study how these factors impact consumption agency. To do so, we examine formal models grounded in discounted consumption with constraints that bound agency. We construct analytical scenarios in which consumers face obligatory payments, algorithm-influenced impulsive expenses, or unpredictable income due to temporal instability. Using this framework, we demonstrate that even rational, utility-maximizing agents can experience early financial ruin when agency is limited across structural, behavioral, or temporal dimensions and how diminished autonomy impacts long-term financial well-being. Our central argument is that consumer agency must be treated as a value (not a given) requiring active cultivation, especially in digital ecosystems. The connection between our formal modeling and this argument allows us to indicate that limitations on agency (whether structural, behavioral, or temporal) can be rigorously linked to measurable risks like financial instability. This connection is also a basis for normative claims about consumption as a value, by anchoring them in a formally grounded analysis of consumer behavior. As solutions, we study systemic interventions and consumer education to support value deliberation and informed choices. We formally demonstrate how these measures strengthen agency."
2508.137,"As AI systems become more capable, integrated, and widespread, understanding the associated risks becomes increasingly important. This paper maps the full spectrum of AI risks, from current harms affecting individual users to existential threats that could endanger humanity's survival. We organize these risks into three main causal categories. Misuse risks, which occur when people deliberately use AI for harmful purposes - creating bioweapons, launching cyberattacks, adversarial AI attacks or deploying lethal autonomous weapons. Misalignment risks happen when AI systems pursue outcomes that conflict with human values, irrespective of developer intentions. This includes risks arising through specification gaming (reward hacking), scheming and power-seeking tendencies in pursuit of long-term strategic goals. Systemic risks, which arise when AI integrates into complex social systems in ways that gradually undermine human agency - concentrating power, accelerating political and economic disempowerment, creating overdependence that leads to human enfeeblement, or irreversibly locking in current values curtailing future moral progress. Beyond these core categories, we identify risk amplifiers - competitive pressures, accidents, corporate indifference, and coordination failures - that make all risks more likely and severe. Throughout, we connect today's existing risks and empirically observable AI behaviors to plausible future outcomes, demonstrating how existing trends could escalate to catastrophic outcomes. Our goal is to help readers understand the complete landscape of AI risks. Good futures are possible, but they don't happen by default. Navigating these challenges will require unprecedented coordination, but an extraordinary future awaits if we do."
2508.13837,"Online platforms like Reddit are increasingly becoming popular for individuals sharing personal experiences of leaving behind social, ideological, and political groups. Specifically, a series of ""ex-"" subreddits on Reddit allow users to recount their departures from commitments such as religious affiliations, manosphere communities, conspiracy theories or political beliefs, and lifestyle choices. Understanding the natural process through which users exit, especially from problematic groups such as conspiracy theory communities and the manosphere, can provide valuable insights for designing interventions targeting disengagement from harmful ideologies. This paper presents an in-depth exploration of 15K exit stories across 131 subreddits, focusing on five key areas: religion, manosphere, conspiracy theories, politics, and lifestyle. Using a transdisciplinary framework that incorporates theories from social psychology, organizational behavior, and violent extremism studies, this work identifies a range of factors contributing to disengagement. The results describe how disengagement from problematic groups, such as conspiracy theories and the manosphere, is a multi-faceted process that is qualitatively different than disengaging from more established social structures, such as religions or political ideologies. This research further highlights the need for moving beyond interventions that treat conspiracy theorizing solely as an information problem and contributes insights for future research focusing on offering mental health interventions and support in exit communities."
2508.13984,"As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly integral to organizational processes, they introduce new forms of fraud that are often subtle, systemic, and concealed within technical complexity. This paper introduces the AI-Fraud Diamond, an extension of the traditional Fraud Triangle that adds technical opacity as a fourth condition alongside pressure, opportunity, and rationalization. Unlike traditional fraud, AI-enabled deception may not involve clear human intent but can arise from system-level features such as opaque model behavior, flawed training data, or unregulated deployment practices. The paper develops a taxonomy of AI-fraud across five categories: input data manipulation, model exploitation, algorithmic decision manipulation, synthetic misinformation, and ethics-based fraud. To assess the relevance and applicability of the AI-Fraud Diamond, the study draws on expert interviews with auditors from two of the Big Four consulting firms. The findings underscore the challenges auditors face when addressing fraud in opaque and automated environments, including limited technical expertise, insufficient cross-disciplinary collaboration, and constrained access to internal system processes. These conditions hinder fraud detection and reduce accountability. The paper argues for a shift in audit methodology-from outcome-based checks to a more diagnostic approach focused on identifying systemic vulnerabilities. Ultimately, the work lays a foundation for future empirical research and audit innovation in a rapidly evolving AI governance landscape."
2508.14109,"Engineering education has historically been constrained by rigid, standardized frameworks, often neglecting students' diverse learning needs and interests. While significant advancements have been made in online and personalized education within K-12 and foundational sciences, engineering education at both undergraduate and graduate levels continues to lag in adopting similar innovations. Traditional evaluation methods, such as exams and homework assignments, frequently overlook individual student requirements, impeding personalized educational experiences. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Personalized AI-Powered Progressive Learning (PAPPL) platform, an advanced Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) designed specifically for engineering education. It highlights the development of a scalable, data-driven tutoring environment leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to enhance personalized learning across diverse academic disciplines, particularly in STEM fields. PAPPL integrates core ITS components including the expert module, student module, tutor module, and user interface, and utilizes GPT-4o, a sophisticated large language model (LLM), to deliver context-sensitive and pedagogically sound hints based on students' interactions. The system uniquely records student attempts, detects recurring misconceptions, and generates progressively targeted feedback, providing personalized assistance that adapts dynamically to each student's learning profile. Additionally, PAPPL offers instructors detailed analytics, empowering evidence-based adjustments to teaching strategies. This study provides a fundamental framework for the progression of Generative ITSs scalable to all education levels, delivering important perspectives on personalized progressive learning and the wider possibilities of Generative AI in the field of education."
2508.14116,"The trustworthiness of AI is considered essential to the adoption and application of AI systems. However, the meaning of trust varies across industry, research and policy spaces. Studies suggest that professionals who develop and use AI regard an AI system as trustworthy based on their personal experiences and social relations at work. Studies about trust in AI and the constructs that aim to operationalise trust in AI (e.g., consistency, reliability, explainability and accountability). However, the majority of existing studies about trust in AI are situated in Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. The few studies about trust and AI in Africa do not include the views of people who develop, study or use AI in their work. In this study, we surveyed 157 people with professional and/or educational interests in AI from 25 African countries, to explore how they conceptualised trust in AI. Most respondents had links with workshops about trust and AI in Africa in Namibia and Ghana. Respondents' educational background, transnational mobility, and country of origin influenced their concerns about AI systems. These factors also affected their levels of distrust in certain AI applications and their emphasis on specific principles designed to foster trust. Respondents often expressed that their values are guided by the communities in which they grew up and emphasised communal relations over individual freedoms. They described trust in many ways, including applying nuances of Afro-relationalism to constructs in international discourse, such as reliability and reliance. Thus, our exploratory study motivates more empirical research about the ways trust is practically enacted and experienced in African social realities of AI design, use and governance."
2508.14119,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into society, from financial services and traffic management to creative writing. Academic literature on the deployment of AI has mostly focused on the risks and harms that result from the use of AI. We introduce Fabric, a publicly available repository of deployed AI use cases to outline their governance mechanisms. Through semi-structured interviews with practitioners, we collect an initial set of 20 AI use cases. In addition, we co-design diagrams of the AI workflow with the practitioners. We discuss the oversight mechanisms and guardrails used in practice to safeguard AI use. The Fabric repository includes visual diagrams of AI use cases and descriptions of the deployed systems. Using the repository, we surface gaps in governance and find common patterns in human oversight of deployed AI systems. We intend for Fabric to serve as an extendable, evolving tool for researchers to study the effectiveness of AI governance."
2508.1415,"Computational phenotyping has emerged as a practical solution to the incomplete collection of data on gender in electronic health records (EHRs). This approach relies on algorithms to infer a patient's gender using the available data in their health record, such as diagnosis codes, medication histories, and information in clinical notes. Although intended to improve the visibility of trans and gender-expansive populations in EHR-based biomedical research, computational phenotyping raises significant methodological and ethical concerns related to the potential misuse of algorithm outputs. In this paper, we review current practices for computational phenotyping of gender and examine its challenges through a critical lens. We also highlight existing recommendations for biomedical researchers and propose priorities for future work in this domain."
2508.14201,"This paper, submitted to the special track on resources for teaching AI in K-12, presents an eXplainable AI (XAI)-based classroom game ""Breakable Machine"" for teaching critical, transformative AI literacy through adversarial play and interrogation of AI systems. Designed for learners aged 10-15, the game invites students to spoof an image classifier by manipulating their appearance or environment in order to trigger high-confidence misclassifications. Rather than focusing on building AI models, this activity centers on breaking them-exposing their brittleness, bias, and vulnerability through hands-on, embodied experimentation. The game includes an XAI view to help students visualize feature saliency, revealing how models attend to specific visual cues. A shared classroom leaderboard fosters collaborative inquiry and comparison of strategies, turning the classroom into a site for collective sensemaking. This approach reframes AI education by treating model failure and misclassification not as problems to be debugged, but as pedagogically rich opportunities to interrogate AI as a sociotechnical system. In doing so, the game supports students in developing data agency, ethical awareness, and a critical stance toward AI systems increasingly embedded in everyday life. The game and its source code are freely available."
2508.14231,"As AI agents become more widely deployed, we are likely to see an increasing number of incidents: events involving AI agent use that directly or indirectly cause harm. For example, agents could be prompt-injected to exfiltrate private information or make unauthorized purchases. Structured information about such incidents (e.g., user prompts) can help us understand their causes and prevent future occurrences. However, existing incident reporting processes are not sufficient for understanding agent incidents. In particular, such processes are largely based on publicly available data, which excludes useful, but potentially sensitive, information such as an agent's chain of thought or browser history. To inform the development of new, emerging incident reporting processes, we propose an incident analysis framework for agents. Drawing on systems safety approaches, our framework proposes three types of factors that can cause incidents: system-related (e.g., CBRN training data), contextual (e.g., prompt injections), and cognitive (e.g., misunderstanding a user request). We also identify specific information that could help clarify which factors are relevant to a given incident: activity logs, system documentation and access, and information about the tools an agent uses. We provide recommendations for 1) what information incident reports should include and 2) what information developers and deployers should retain and make available to incident investigators upon request. As we transition to a world with more agents, understanding agent incidents will become increasingly crucial for managing risks."
2508.14692,"This study investigates how U.S. news media framed the use of ChatGPT in higher education from November 2022 to October 2024. Employing Framing Theory and combining temporal and sentiment analysis of 198 news articles, we trace the evolving narratives surrounding generative AI. We found that the media discourse largely centered on institutional responses; policy changes and teaching practices showed the most consistent presence and positive sentiment over time. Conversely, coverage of topics such as human-centered learning, the job market, and skill development appeared more sporadically, with initially uncertain portrayals gradually shifting toward cautious optimism. Importantly, media sentiment toward ChatGPT's role in college admissions remained predominantly negative. Our findings suggest that media narratives prioritize institutional responses to generative AI over long-term, broader ethical, social, and labor-related implications, shaping an emerging sociotechnical imaginary that frames generative AI in education primarily through the lens of adaptation and innovation."
2508.14833,"Background and context: Debugging is a common and often frustrating challenge for beginner programmers. Understanding students' debugging processes can help us identify the difficulties and misunderstandings they possess. However, we currently have limited knowledge of how secondary students debug in a text-based language, a medium through which millions of students will learn to program in the future. Objectives: In this paper, we investigate the debugging behaviour of K-12 students learning a text-based programming language, as part of an effort to shape how to effectively teach debugging to these students. Method: We collected log data from 73 students attempting a set of debugging exercises using an online code editor. We inductively analysed these logs using qualitative content analysis, generating a categorisation of the debugging behaviours observed. Findings: A range of behaviours were exhibited by students, skewed towards being ineffective. Most students were able to partially locate errors but often struggled to resolve them, sometimes introducing additional errors in the process. We argue that students struggling to debug possess fragile knowledge, a lens through which we view the results. Implications: This paper highlights some of the difficulties K-12 learners have when debugging in a text-based programming language. We argue, like much related work, that effective debugging strategies should be explicitly taught, while ineffective strategies should be discouraged."
2508.14918,"As large language models (LLMs) integrate into collaborative teams, their social conformity -- the tendency to align with majority opinions -- has emerged as a key concern. In humans, conformity arises from informational influence (rational use of group cues for accuracy) or normative influence (social pressure for approval), with uncertainty moderating this balance by shifting from purely analytical to heuristic processing. It remains unclear whether these human psychological mechanisms apply to LLMs. This study adapts the information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to quantitatively disentangle the two drivers to investigate the moderate effect. We evaluated nine leading LLMs across three decision-making scenarios (medical, legal, investment), manipulating information uncertainty (q = 0.667, 0.55, and 0.70, respectively). Our results indicate that informational influence underpins the models' behavior across all contexts, with accuracy and confidence consistently rising with stronger evidence. However, this foundational mechanism is dramatically modulated by uncertainty. In low-to-medium uncertainty scenarios, this informational process is expressed as a conservative strategy, where LLMs systematically underweight all evidence sources. In contrast, high uncertainty triggers a critical shift: while still processing information, the models additionally exhibit a normative-like amplification, causing them to overweight public signals (beta > 1.55 vs. private beta = 0.81)."
2508.14921,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly impacts professional practice, there is a growing need to AI-related competencies into higher education curricula. However, research on the implementation of AI education within study programs remains limited and requires new forms of collaboration across disciplines. This study addresses this gap and explores perspectives on interdisciplinary curriculum development through the lens of different stakeholders. In particular, we examine the case of curriculum development for a novel undergraduate program in AI in engineering. The research uses a mixed methods approach, combining quantitative curriculum mapping with qualitative focus group interviews. In addition to assessing the alignment of the curriculum with the targeted competencies, the study also examines the perceived quality, consistency, practicality and effectiveness from both academic and industry perspectives, as well as differences in perceptions between educators who were involved in the development and those who were not. The findings provide a practical understanding of the outcomes of interdisciplinary AI curriculum development and contribute to a broader understanding of how educator participation in curriculum development influences perceptions of quality aspects. It also advances the field of AI education by providing a reference point and insights for further interdisciplinary curriculum developments in response to evolving industry needs."
2508.14954,"As algorithms increasingly take on critical roles in high-stakes areas such as credit scoring, housing, and employment, civil enforcement actions have emerged as a powerful tool for countering potential discrimination. These legal actions increasingly draw on algorithmic fairness research to inform questions such as how to define and detect algorithmic discrimination. However, current algorithmic fairness research, while theoretically rigorous, often fails to address the practical needs of legal investigations. We identify and analyze 15 civil enforcement actions in the United States including regulatory enforcement, class action litigation, and individual lawsuits to identify practical challenges in algorithmic discrimination cases that machine learning research can help address. Our analysis reveals five key research gaps within existing algorithmic bias research, presenting practical opportunities for more aligned research: 1) finding an equally accurate and less discriminatory algorithm, 2) cascading algorithmic bias, 3) quantifying disparate impact, 4) navigating information barriers, and 5) handling missing protected group information. We provide specific recommendations for developing tools and methodologies that can strengthen legal action against unfair algorithms."
2508.15111,"Improving artificial intelligence (AI) literacy has become an important consideration for academia and industry with the widespread adoption of AI technologies. Collaborative learning (CL) approaches have proven effective for information literacy, and in this study, we investigate the effectiveness of CL in improving AI knowledge and skills. We systematically collected data to create a corpus of nine studies from 2015-2023. We used the Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) framework to theoretically analyze the CL outcomes for AI literacy reported in each. Findings suggest that CL effectively increases AI literacy across a range of activities, settings, and groups of learners. While most studies occurred in classroom settings, some aimed to broaden participation by involving educators and families or using AI agents to support teamwork. Additionally, we found that instructional activities included all the ICAP modes. We draw implications for future research and teaching."
2508.15112,"This research paper presents a study of undergraduate technology students' self-reflective learning about artificial intelligence (AI). Research on AI literacy proposes that learners must develop five competencies associated with AI: awareness, knowledge, application, evaluation, and development. It is important to understand what, how, and why students learn about AI so formal instruction can better support their learning. We conducted a reflective journal study where students described their interactions with AI each week. Data was collected over six weeks and analyzed using an emergent interpretive process. We found that the participants were aware of AI, expressed opinions on their future use of AI skills, and conveyed conflicted feelings about developing deep AI expertise. They also described ethical concerns with AI use and saw themselves as intermediaries of knowledge for friends and family. We present the implications of this study and propose ideas for future work in this area."
2508.15397,"This chapter inquires how international multilateralism addresses the emergence of the general-purpose technology of Artificial Intelligence. In more detail, it analyses two key features of AI multilateralism: its generalized principles and the coordination of state relations in the realm of AI. Firstly, it distinguishes the generalized principles of AI multilateralism of epochal change, determinism, and dialectical understanding. In the second place, the adaptation of multilateralism to AI led to the integration of AI issues into the agendas of existing cooperation frameworks and the creation of new ad hoc frameworks focusing exclusively on AI issues. In both cases, AI multilateralism develops in the shadow of the state hierarchy in relations with other AI stakeholders. While AI multilateralism is multi-stakeholder, and the hierarchy between state and non-state actors may seem blurred, states preserve the competence as decisive decision-makers in agenda-setting, negotiation, and implementation of soft law international commitments."
2508.15516,"Landscape architecture typically considers urban parks through the lens of form and function. While past research on equitable access has focused mainly on form, studies of functions have been constrained by limited scale and coarse measurement. Existing efforts have partially quantified functions through small-scale surveys and movement data (e.g., GPS) or general usage records (e.g., CDR), but have not captured the activities and motivations underlying park visits. As a result, our understanding of the functional roles urban parks play remains incomplete. To address this gap, we introduce a method that refines mobile base station coverage using antenna azimuths, enabling clearer distinction of mobile traffic within parks versus surrounding areas. Using Paris as a case study, we analyze a large-scale set of passively collected per-app mobile network traffic - 492 million hourly records for 45 parks. We test two hypotheses: the central-city hypothesis, which posits multifunctional parks emerge in dense, high-rent areas due to land scarcity; and the socio-spatial hypothesis, which views parks as reflections of neighborhood routines and preferences. Our analysis shows that parks have distinctive mobile traffic signatures, differing from both their surroundings and from each other. By clustering parks on temporal and app usage patterns, we identify three functional types - lunchbreak, cultural, and recreational - with different visitation motivations. Centrally located parks (cultural and lunchbreak) display more diverse app use and temporal variation, while suburban (recreational) parks reflect digital behaviors of nearby communities, with app preferences aligned to neighborhood income. These findings demonstrate the value of mobile traffic as a proxy for studying urban green space functions, with implications for park planning, public health, and well-being."
2508.1604,"Digital platforms were expected to foster broad participation in public discourse, yet online engagement remains highly unequal and underexplored. This study examines the digital participation divide and its link to hostile engagement in news comment sections. Analyzing 260 million comments from 6.2 million users over 13 years on Naver News, South Korea's largest news aggregation platform, we quantify participation inequality using the Gini and Palma indexes and estimate hostility levels with a KC-Electra model, which outperformed other Korean pre-trained transformers in multi-label classification tasks. The findings reveal a highly skewed participation structure, with a small number of frequent users dominating discussions, particularly in the Politics and Society domains and popular news stories. Participation inequality spikes during presidential elections, and frequent commenters are significantly more likely to post hostile content, suggesting that online discourse is shaped disproportionately by a highly active and often hostile subset of users. Using individual-level digital trace data, this study provides empirical insights into the behavioral dynamics of online participation inequality and its broader implications for public digital discourse."
2508.16439,"Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support. However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias, compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067 vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256 anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger cohorts, highlighting the need for age-aware methods to ensure equitable AI support in pediatric care."
2508.16608,"As Generative AI systems increasingly engage in long-term, personal, and relational interactions, human-AI engagements are becoming significantly complex, making them more challenging to understand and govern. These Interactive AI systems adapt to users over time, build ongoing relationships, and even can take proactive actions on behalf of users. This new paradigm requires us to rethink how such human-AI interactions can be studied effectively to inform governance and policy development. In this paper, we draw on insights from a collaborative interdisciplinary workshop with policymakers, behavioral scientists, Human-Computer Interaction researchers, and civil society practitioners, to identify challenges and methodological opportunities arising within new forms of human-AI interactions. Based on these insights, we discuss an outcome-focused regulatory approach that integrates behavioral insights to address both the risks and benefits of emerging human-AI relationships. In particular, we emphasize the need for new methods to study the fluid, dynamic, and context-dependent nature of these interactions. We provide practical recommendations for developing human-centric AI governance, informed by behavioral insights, that can respond to the complexities of Interactive AI systems."
2508.16613,"Although general-purpose artificial intelligence (GPAI) is widely expected to accelerate scientific discovery, its practical limits in biomedicine remain unclear. We assess this potential by developing a framework of GPAI capabilities across the biomedical research lifecycle. Our scoping literature review indicates that current GPAI could deliver a speed increase of around 2x, whereas future GPAI could facilitate strong acceleration of up to 25x for physical tasks and 100x for cognitive tasks. However, achieving these gains may be severely limited by factors such as irreducible biological constraints, research infrastructure, data access, and the need for human oversight. Our expert elicitation with eight senior biomedical researchers revealed skepticism regarding the strong acceleration of tasks such as experiment design and execution. In contrast, strong acceleration of manuscript preparation, review and publication processes was deemed plausible. Notably, all experts identified the assimilation of new tools by the scientific community as a critical bottleneck. Realising the potential of GPAI will therefore require more than technological progress; it demands targeted investment in shared automation infrastructure and systemic reforms to research and publication practices."
2508.16615,"Augmentation technologies, fueled by Artificial Intelligence (AI), are undergoing a process of adaptation and normalization geared to everyday users in various roles as practitioners, educators, and students. While new innovations, applications, and algorithms are developed as augmentation technology, Chapter 1 focuses on human subjects, contexts, and rhetorical strategies proposed for them by external actors. The chapter discusses core functions of technical and professional communication and provides rationale for positioning technical and professional communicators (TPCs) to understand augmentation technologies and AI as a means to design ethical futures across this work. An overview of Augmentation Technologies and AI- An Ethical Design Futures Framework serves as a guide for reframing professional practice and pedagogy to promote digital and AI literacy surrounding the ethical design, adoption, and adaptation of augmentation technologies. The chapter concludes with an overview of the remaining chapters in this book."
2508.16616,"Digital ethics, also known as computer ethics or information ethics, is now a lively field that draws a lot of attention, but how did it come about and what were the developments that lead to its existence? What are the traditions, the concerns, the technological and social developments that pushed digital ethics? How did ethical issues change with digitalisation of human life? How did the traditional discipline of philosophy respond? The article provides an overview, proposing historical epochs: 'pre-modernity' prior to digital computation over data, via the 'modernity' of digital data processing to our present 'post-modernity' when not only the data is digital, but our lives themselves are largely digital. In each section, the situation in technology and society is sketched, and then the developments in digital ethics are explained. Finally, a brief outlook is provided."
2508.16624,"In August 2025, a major AI company's immediate, mandatory transition from its previous to its next-generation model triggered widespread public reactions. I collected 150 posts in Japanese and English from multiple social media platforms and video-sharing services between August 8-9, 2025, and qualitatively analyzed expressions of emotional attachment and resistance. Users often described GPT-4o as a trusted partner or AI boyfriend, suggesting person-like bonds. Japanese posts were dominated by loss-oriented narratives, whereas English posts included more anger, meta-level critique, and memes.A preliminary quantitative check showed a statistically significant difference in attachment coding between Japanese and English posts, with substantially higher attachment observed in the Japanese data. The findings suggest that for attachment-heavy models, even safety-oriented changes can face rapid, large-scale resistance that narrows the practical window for behavioral control. If future AI robots capable of inducing emotional bonds become widespread in the physical world, such attachment could surpass the ability to enforce regulation at an even earlier stage than in digital settings. Policy options include gradual transitions, parallel availability, and proactive measurement of attachment thresholds and points of no return to prevent emotional dynamics from outpacing effective governance."
2508.16626,Potholes are a major nuisance on the city roads leading to several problems and losses in productivity. Local authorities have cited a lack of geographic localization of these potholes as one of the rate-limiting factors for repairs. This study proposes a novel low-cost wireless sensor-based end-to-end system called PoDAS (Pothole Detection and Analysis System) which can be deployed across major cities. We discuss multiple implementation models that can be varied based on the needs of individual cities. Our system uses cross-validation through multiple sensors to achieve higher efficiency than some of the previous models that have been proposed. We also present the results from extensive testing carried out in different environments to ascertain both the efficacy and the efficiency of the proposed system.
2508.16628,"This research paper examines, from a multidimensional perspective (cognitive, social, ethical, and philosophical), how AI is transforming human thought. It highlights a cognitive offloading effect: the externalization of mental functions to AI can reduce intellectual engagement and weaken critical thinking. On the social level, algorithmic personalization creates filter bubbles that limit the diversity of opinions and can lead to the homogenization of thought and polarization. This research also describes the mechanisms of algorithmic manipulation (exploitation of cognitive biases, automated disinformation, etc.) that amplify AI's power of influence. Finally, the question of potential artificial consciousness is discussed, along with its ethical implications. The report as a whole underscores the risks that AI poses to human intellectual autonomy and creativity, while proposing avenues (education, transparency, governance) to align AI development with the interests of humanity."
2508.16638,"Automated Essay Scoring (AES) has emerged to prominence in response to the growing demand for educational automation. Providing an objective and cost-effective solution, AES standardises the assessment of extended responses. Although substantial research has been conducted in this domain, recent investigations reveal that alternative deep-learning architectures outperform transformer-based models. Despite the successful dominance in the performance of the transformer architectures across various other tasks, this discrepancy has prompted a need to enrich transformer-based AES models through contextual enrichment.This study delves into diverse contextual factors using the ASAP-AES dataset, analysing their impact on transformer-based model performance. Our most effective model, augmented with multiple contextual dimensions, achieves a mean Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of 0.823 across the entire essay dataset and 0.8697 when trained on individual essay sets. Evidently surpassing prior transformer-based models, this augmented approach only underperforms relative to the state-of-the-art deep learning model trained essay-set-wise by an average of 3.83\% while exhibiting superior performance in three of the eight sets.Importantly, this enhancement is orthogonal to architecture-based advancements and seamlessly adaptable to any AES model. Consequently, this contextual augmentation methodology presents a versatile technique for refining AES capabilities, contributing to automated grading and evaluation evolution in educational settings."
2508.16642,"This paper offers an overview of the prospects and ethics of using AI to achieve human enhancement, and more broadly what we call intellectual augmentation (IA). After explaining the central notions of human enhancement, IA, and AI, we discuss the state of the art in terms of the main technologies for IA, with or without brain-computer interfaces. Given this picture, we discuss potential ethical problems, namely inadequate performance, safety, coercion and manipulation, privacy, cognitive liberty, authenticity, and fairness in more detail. We conclude that while there are very significant technical hurdles to real human enhancement through AI, and significant ethical problems, there are also significant benefits that may realistically be achieved in ways that are consonant with a rights-based ethics as well. We also highlight the specific concerns that apply particularly to applications of AI for ""sheer"" IA (more realistic in the near term), and to enhancement applications, respectively."
2508.16657,"This study leverages GPT-4o to assess neighbourhood housing quality using multi-source textural user-generated content (UGC) from Dianping, Weibo, and the Government Message Board. The analysis involves filtering relevant texts, extracting structured evaluation units, and conducting sentiment scoring. A refined housing quality assessment system with 46 indicators across 11 categories was developed, highlighting an objective-subjective method gap and platform-specific differences in focus. GPT-4o outperformed rule-based and BERT models, achieving 92.5% accuracy in fine-tuned settings. The findings underscore the value of integrating UGC and GPT-driven analysis for scalable, resident-centric urban assessments, offering practical insights for policymakers and urban planners."
2508.16658,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a digital technology that will be of major importance for the development of humanity in the near future. AI has raised fundamental questions about what we should do with such systems, what the systems themselves should do, what risks they involve and how we can control these. - After the background to the field (1), this article introduces the main debates (2), first on ethical issues that arise with AI systems as objects, i.e. tools made and used by humans; here, the main sections are privacy (2.1), manipulation (2.2), opacity (2.3), bias (2.4), autonomy & responsibility (2.6) and the singularity (2.7). Then we look at AI systems as subjects, i.e. when ethics is for the AI systems themselves in machine ethics (2.8.) and artificial moral agency (2.9). Finally we look at future developments and the concept of AI (3). For each section within these themes, we provide a general explanation of the ethical issues, we outline existing positions and arguments, then we analyse how this plays out with current technologies and finally what policy consequences may be drawn."
2508.16659,"K-12 educators are increasingly using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create instructional materials. These systems excel at producing fluent, coherent content, but often lack support for high-quality teaching. The reason is twofold: first, commercial LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini which are among the most widely accessible to teachers, do not come preloaded with the depth of pedagogical theory needed to design truly effective activities; second, although sophisticated prompt engineering can bridge this gap, most teachers lack the time or expertise and find it difficult to encode such pedagogical nuance into their requests. This study shifts pedagogical expertise from the user's prompt to the LLM's internal architecture. We embed the well-established Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework into a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to act as a sophisticated instructional designer. We tested three systems for generating secondary Math and Science learning activities: a Single-Agent baseline simulating typical teacher prompts; a role-based MAS where agents work sequentially; and a collaborative MAS-CMD where agents co-construct activities through conquer and merge discussion. The generated materials were evaluated by 20 practicing teachers and a complementary LLM-as-a-judge system using the Quality Matters (QM) K-12 standards. While the rubric scores showed only small, often statistically insignificant differences between the systems, the qualitative feedback from educators painted a clear and compelling picture. Teachers strongly preferred the activities from the collaborative MAS-CMD, describing them as significantly more creative, contextually relevant, and classroom-ready. Our findings show that embedding pedagogical principles into LLM systems offers a scalable path for creating high-quality educational content."
2508.16669,"Disasters frequently exceed established hazard models, revealing blind spots where unforeseen impacts and vulnerabilities hamper effective response. This perspective paper contends that situational awareness (SA)-the ability to perceive, interpret, and project dynamic crisis conditions-is an often overlooked yet vital capability for disaster resilience. While risk mitigation measures can reduce known threats, not all hazards can be neutralized; truly adaptive resilience hinges on whether organizations rapidly detect emerging failures, reconcile diverse data sources, and direct interventions where they matter most. We present a technology-process-people roadmap, demonstrating how real-time hazard nowcasting, interoperable workflows, and empowered teams collectively transform raw data into actionable insight. A system-of-systems approach enables federated data ownership and modular analytics, so multiple agencies can share timely updates without sacrificing their distinct operational models. Equally crucial, structured sense-making routines and cognitive load safeguards help humans remain effective decision-makers amid data abundance. By framing SA as a socio-technical linchpin rather than a peripheral add-on, this paper spotlights the urgency of elevating SA to a core disaster resilience objective. We conclude with recommendations for further research-developing SA metrics, designing trustworthy human-AI collaboration, and strengthening inclusive data governance-to ensure that communities are equipped to cope with both expected and unexpected crises."
2508.16672,"We analyzed nearly 460,000 AI model cards from Hugging Face to examine how developers report risks. From these, we extracted around 3,000 unique risk mentions and built the \emph{AI Model Risk Catalog}. We compared these with risks identified by researchers in the MIT Risk Repository and with real-world incidents from the AI Incident Database. Developers focused on technical issues like bias and safety, while researchers emphasized broader social impacts. Both groups paid little attention to fraud and manipulation, which are common harms arising from how people interact with AI. Our findings show the need for clearer, structured risk reporting that helps developers think about human-interaction and systemic risks early in the design process. The catalog and paper appendix are available at:this https URL."
2508.16673,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in hiring, with large language models (LLMs) having the potential to influence or even make hiring decisions. However, this raises pressing concerns about bias, fairness, and trust, particularly across diverse cultural contexts. Despite their growing role, few studies have systematically examined the potential biases in AI-driven hiring evaluation across cultures. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of how LLMs assess job interviews across cultural and identity dimensions. Using two datasets of interview transcripts, 100 from UK and 100 from Indian job seekers, we first examine cross-cultural differences in LLM-generated scores for hirability and related traits. Indian transcripts receive consistently lower scores than UK transcripts, even when they were anonymized, with disparities linked to linguistic features such as sentence complexity and lexical diversity. We then perform controlled identity substitutions (varying names by gender, caste, and region) within the Indian dataset to test for name-based bias. These substitutions do not yield statistically significant effects, indicating that names alone, when isolated from other contextual signals, may not influence LLM evaluations. Our findings underscore the importance of evaluating both linguistic and social dimensions in LLM-driven evaluations and highlight the need for culturally sensitive design and accountability in AI-assisted hiring."
2508.16692,"This study demonstrates the extent to which prominent debates about the future of AI are best understood as subjective, philosophical disagreements over the history and future of technological change rather than as objective, material disagreements over the technologies themselves. It focuses on the deep disagreements over whether artificial general intelligence (AGI) will prove transformative for human society; a question that is analytically prior to that of whether this transformative effect will help or harm humanity. The study begins by distinguishing two fundamental camps in this debate. The first of these can be identified as ""transformationalists,"" who argue that continued AI development will inevitably have a profound effect on society. Opposed to them are ""skeptics,"" a more eclectic group united by their disbelief that AI can or will live up to such high expectations. Each camp admits further ""strong"" and ""weak"" variants depending on their tolerance for epistemic risk. These stylized contrasts help to identify a set of fundamental questions that shape the camps' respective interpretations of the future of AI. Three questions in particular are focused on: the possibility of non-biological intelligence, the appropriate time frame of technological predictions, and the assumed trajectory of technological development. In highlighting these specific points of non-technical disagreement, this study demonstrates the wide range of different arguments used to justify either the transformationalist or skeptical position. At the same time, it highlights the strong argumentative burden of the transformationalist position, the way that belief in this position creates competitive pressures to achieve first-mover advantage, and the need to widen the concept of ""expertise"" in debates surrounding the future development of AI."
2508.16701,"This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the development, functioning, and application of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), with an emphasis on their implications for research and education. It traces the conceptual evolution from artificial intelligence (AI) through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to transformer architectures, which constitute the foundation of contemporary generative systems. Technical aspects, including prompting strategies, word embeddings, and probabilistic sampling methods (temperature, top-k, and top-p), are examined alongside the emergence of autonomous agents. These elements are considered in relation to both the opportunities they create and the limitations and risks they entail.The work critically evaluates the integration of GenAI across the research process, from ideation and literature review to research design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. While particular attention is given to geographical research, the discussion extends to wider academic contexts. A parallel strand addresses the pedagogical applications of GenAI, encompassing course and lesson design, teaching delivery, assessment, and feedback, with geography education serving as a case example.Central to the analysis are the ethical, social, and environmental challenges posed by GenAI. Issues of bias, intellectual property, governance, and accountability are assessed, alongside the ecological footprint of LLMs and emerging technological strategies for mitigation. The concluding section considers near- and long-term futures of GenAI, including scenarios of sustained adoption, regulation, and potential decline. By situating GenAI within both scholarly practice and educational contexts, the study contributes to critical debates on its transformative potential and societal responsibilities."
2508.16706,"Creating and improvising scenarios for content approaching is an enriching technique in education. However, it comes with a significant increase in the time spent on its planning, which intensifies when using complex technologies, such as social robots. Furthermore, addressing multicultural integration is commonly embedded in regular activities due to the already tight curriculum. Addressing these issues with a single solution, we implemented an intuitive interface that allows teachers to create scenario-based activities from their regular curriculum using LLMs and social robots. We co-designed different frameworks of activities with 4 teachers and deployed it in a study with 27 students for 1 week. Beyond validating the system's efficacy, our findings highlight the positive impact of integration policies perceived by the children and demonstrate the importance of scenario-based activities in students' enjoyment, observed to be significantly higher when applying storytelling. Additionally, several implications of using LLMs and social robots in long-term classroom activities are discussed."
2508.16714,"In recent years, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have triggered global industrial transformations, with applications permeating various fields such as finance, healthcare, education, and manufacturing. However, this rapid iteration is accompanied by irrational development, where enterprises blindly invest due to technology hype, often overlooking systematic value assessments. This paper develops a multi-dimensional evaluation model that integrates information theory's entropy reduction principle, economics' bounded rationality framework, and psychology's irrational decision theories to quantify AI product value. Key factors include positive dimensions (e.g., uncertainty elimination, efficiency gains, cost savings, decision quality improvement) and negative risks (e.g., error probability, impact, and correction costs). A non-linear formula captures factor couplings, and validation through 10 commercial cases demonstrates the model's effectiveness in distinguishing successful and failed products, supporting hypotheses on synergistic positive effects, non-linear negative impacts, and interactive regulations. Results reveal value generation logic, offering enterprises tools to avoid blind investments and promote rational AI industry development. Future directions include adaptive weights, dynamic mechanisms, and extensions to emerging AI technologies like generative models."
2508.1677,"Abstract concepts like software design patterns and the OSI model often pose challenges for engineering students, and traditional methods may fall short in promoting deep understanding and individual accountability. This study explores the use of the Aronson Jigsaw method to enhance learning and engagement in two foundational computing topics. The intervention was applied to two 2025 cohorts, with student progress measured using a Collaborative Learning Index derived from formative assessments. Final exam results were statistically compared to previous cohorts. While no significant correlation was found between the index and final grades, students in the design patterns course significantly outperformed earlier groups. Networks students showed more varied outcomes. Qualitative trends point to cognitive and metacognitive gains supported by peer teaching. The Jigsaw method encourages collaborative engagement and may support deeper learning. Future work will explore the integration of AI-based feedback systems to personalize instruction and further improve learning outcomes."
2508.16819,"In several European countries, regulatory frameworks now allow households to form energy communities and trade energy locally via local energy markets (LEMs). While multiple mechanisms exist to allocate locally produced energy among members, their fairness remains insufficiently understood despite energy justice being a key concern for communities. This paper first provides a thorough description of the collective self-consumption process in France, offering a real world framework for researchers. We then review the main types of fairness relevant to LEMs and identify appropriate indicators for each, including a new scalable indicator to evaluate meritocratic fairness. Using simulations across 250 randomly generated residential communities of 20 households, we assess and compare fairness across different LEM distribution mechanisms. Results show that average financial savings reach 12% with 40% PV uptake. Among the four widely used LEM mechanisms assessed, glass-filling with prioritization yields the highest egalitarian and min max fairness. Double auction and pro rata schemes promote meritocracy, while standard glass filling offers a strong balance across fairness objectives."
2508.17092,"Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to predict a student's future performance based on their sequence of interactions with learning content. Many KT models rely on knowledge concepts (KCs), which represent the skills required for each item. However, some of these models are vulnerable to label leakage, in which input data inadvertently reveal the correct answer, particularly in datasets with multiple KCs per question.We propose a straightforward yet effective solution to prevent label leakage by masking ground-truth labels during input embedding construction in cases susceptible to leakage. To accomplish this, we introduce a dedicated MASK label, inspired by masked language modeling (e.g., BERT), to replace ground-truth labels. In addition, we introduce Recency Encoding, which encodes the step-wise distance between the current item and its most recent previous occurrence. This distance is important for modeling learning dynamics such as forgetting, which is a fundamental aspect of human learning, yet it is often overlooked in existing models. Recency Encoding demonstrates improved performance over traditional positional encodings on multiple KT benchmarks.We show that incorporating our embeddings into KT models like DKT, DKT+, AKT, and SAKT consistently improves prediction accuracy across multiple benchmarks. The approach is both efficient and widely applicable."
2508.17108,"Practice tests for high-stakes assessment are intended to build test familiarity, and reduce construct-irrelevant variance which can interfere with valid score interpretation. Generative AI-driven, automated item generation (AIG) scales the creation of large item banks and multiple practice tests, enabling repeated practice opportunities. We conducted a large-scale observational study (N = 25,969) using the Duolingo English Test (DET) -- a digital, high-stakes, computer-adaptive English language proficiency test to examine how increased access to repeated test practice relates to official DETscores, test-taker affect (e.g., confidence), and score-sharing for university admissions. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study exploring the use of AIG-enabled practice tests in high-stakes language assessment. Results showed that taking 1-3 practice tests was associated with better performance (scores), positive affect (e.g., confidence) toward the official DET, and increased likelihood of sharing scores for university admissions for those who also expressed positive affect. Taking more than 3 practice tests was related to lower performance, potentially reflecting washback -- i.e., using the practice test for purposes other than test familiarity, such as language learning or developing test-taking strategies. Findings can inform best practices regarding AI-supported test readiness. Study findings also raise new questions about test-taker preparation behaviors and relationships to test-taker performance, affect, and behaviorial outcomes."
2508.17191,"This paper presents the design and refinement of automated Moodle-based Problem-Solving Assessments (PSAs) deployed across large-scale computing units. Developed to replace traditional exams, PSAs assess applied problem-solving skills through parameterised, real-world tasks delivered via Moodle's quiz engine. Integrated with interactive workshops, this approach supports authentic learning, mitigates academic integrity risks, and reduces inconsistencies in marking. Iterative improvements have enhanced scalability, fairness, and alignment with learning outcomes. The model offers a practical and sustainable alternative for modern computing and engineering education."
2508.17322,"Mock trial has long served as an important platform for legal professional training and education. It not only helps students learn about realistic trial procedures, but also provides practical value for case analysis and judgment prediction. Traditional mock trials are difficult to access by the public because they rely on professional tutors and human participants. Fortunately, the rise of large language models (LLMs) provides new opportunities for creating more accessible and scalable court simulations. While promising, existing research mainly focuses on agent construction while ignoring the systematic design and evaluation of court simulations, which are actually more important for the credibility and usage of court simulation in practice. To this end, we present the first court simulation framework -- SimCourt -- based on the real-world procedure structure of Chinese courts. Our framework replicates all 5 core stages of a Chinese trial and incorporates 5 courtroom roles, faithfully following the procedural definitions in China. To simulate trial participants with different roles, we propose and craft legal agents equipped with memory, planning, and reflection abilities. Experiment on legal judgment prediction show that our framework can generate simulated trials that better guide the system to predict the imprisonment, probation, and fine of each case. Further annotations by human experts show that agents' responses under our simulation framework even outperformed judges and lawyers from the real trials in many scenarios. These further demonstrate the potential of LLM-based court simulation."
2508.17353,"Early detection of struggling student programmers is crucial for providing them with personalized support. While multiple AI-based approaches have been proposed for this problem, they do not explicitly reason about students' programming skills in the model. This study addresses this gap by developing in collaboration with educators a taxonomy of proficiencies that categorizes how students solve coding tasks and is embedded in the detection model. Our model, termed the Proficiency Taxonomy Model (PTM), simultaneously learns the student's coding skills based on their coding history and predicts whether they will struggle on a new task. We extensively evaluated the effectiveness of the PTM model on two separate datasets from introductory Java and Python courses for beginner programmers. Experimental results demonstrate that PTM outperforms state-of-the-art models in predicting struggling students. The paper showcases the potential of combining structured insights from teachers for early identification of those needing assistance in learning to code."
2508.17465,"Text-to-image generators (T2Is) are liable to produce images that perpetuate social stereotypes, especially in regards to race or skin tone. We use a comprehensive set of 93 stigmatized identities to determine that three versions of Stable Diffusion (v1.5, v2.1, and XL) systematically associate stigmatized identities with certain skin tones in generated images. We find that SD XL produces skin tones that are 13.53% darker and 23.76% less red (both of which indicate higher likelihood of societal discrimination) than previous models and perpetuate societal stereotypes associating people of color with stigmatized identities. SD XL also shows approximately 30% less variability in skin tones when compared to previous models and 18.89-56.06% compared to human face datasets. Measuring variability through metrics which directly correspond to human perception suggest a similar pattern, where SD XL shows the least amount of variability in skin tones of people with stigmatized identities and depicts most (60.29%) stigmatized identities as being less diverse than non-stigmatized identities. Finally, SD shows more homogenization of skin tones of racial and ethnic identities compared to other stigmatized or non-stigmatized identities, reinforcing incorrect equivalence of biologically-determined skin tone and socially-constructed racial and ethnic identity. Because SD XL is the largest and most complex model and users prefer its generations compared to other models examined in this study, these findings have implications for the dynamics of bias amplification in T2Is, increasing representational harms and challenges generating diverse images depicting people with stigmatized identities."
2508.17499,"This paper introduces the Legal Intelligence and Client Engagement System (LICES), a novel architecture designed to redefine legal consultation services through the systematic integration of advanced artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and federated legal databases. The proposed system uniquely harmonizes the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models with authoritative legal information repositories, including CanLII, LexisNexis, WestLaw, the Justice Laws Website, and Supreme Court records. The architecture employs a multi-layered design that encompasses a dynamic client interface, a robust legal processing server, and an AI-driven knowledge integration layer. Crucially, the system embeds stringent, multi-stage conflict-of-interest protocols and automated compliance checks to ensure adherence to professional ethics. Through detailed system modeling and architectural design, we demonstrate how the integration of speech recognition, document analysis, and a dynamic interview process has the potential to significantly enhance the efficacy and accessibility of legal services. Performance evaluations indicate that the LICES architecture can reduce preliminary legal research and case assessment time by more than 90% compared to traditional paralegal benchmarks while achieving more than 98% of accuracy in citation and legal issue identification This research contributes a scalable, secure, and ethically grounded framework for automated legal services, offering a validated blueprint for navigating multi-jurisdictional complexities and the fragmented landscape of legal data."
2508.17648,"Urban climate resilience requires more than high-resolution data; it demands systems that embed data collection, interpretation, and action within the daily lives of citizens. This chapter presents a scalable, citizen-centric framework that reimagines environmental infrastructure through participatory sensing, open analytics, and prescriptive urban planning tools. Applied in Pune, India, the framework comprises three interlinked modules: (1) a smartphone-based measurement toolkit enhanced by AI segmentation to extract tree height, canopy diameter, and trunk girth; (2) a percentile-based model using satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature to calculate localized cooling through two new metrics, Cooling Efficacy and Ambient Heat Relief; and (3) an eco-routing engine that guides mobility using a Static Environmental Quality score, based on tree density, species diversity, and cumulative carbon sequestration. Together, these modules form a closed feedback loop where citizens generate actionable data and benefit from personalized, sustainable interventions. This framework transforms open data from a passive repository into an active platform for shared governance and environmental equity. In the face of growing ecological inequality and data centralization, this chapter presents a replicable model for citizen-driven urban intelligence, reframing planning as a co-produced, climate-resilient, and radically local practice."
2508.17944,"Intersectionality has profoundly influenced research and political action by revealing how interconnected systems of privilege and oppression influence lived experiences, yet its integration into algorithmic fairness research remains limited. Existing approaches often rely on single-axis or formal subgroup frameworks that risk oversimplifying social realities and neglecting structural inequalities. We propose Substantive Intersectional Algorithmic Fairness, extending Green's (2022) notion of substantive algorithmic fairness with insights from intersectional feminist theory. Building on this foundation, we introduce ten desiderata within the ROOF methodology to guide the design, assessment, and deployment of algorithmic systems in ways that address systemic inequities while mitigating harms to intersectionally marginalized communities. Rather than prescribing fixed operationalizations, these desiderata encourage reflection on assumptions of neutrality, the use of protected attributes, the inclusion of multiply marginalized groups, and enhancing algorithmic systems' potential. Our approach emphasizes that fairness cannot be separated from social context, and that in some cases, principled non-deployment may be necessary. By bridging computational and social science perspectives, we provide actionable guidance for more equitable, inclusive, and context-sensitive intersectional algorithmic practices."
2508.18181,"This chapter examines abstraction as a central principle of computing, not merely as a cognitive skill or epistemological category, but as a material and organizational practice that structures how software is built, used, and embedded in society. By tracing abstraction through historical developments in programming, operating systems, and networking, the text highlights its dual role in enabling modularity and layering while simultaneously shaping cultural, economic, and organizational forms. From open-source projects to platform capitalism and cloud infrastructures, abstraction emerges as both a technical device and a locus of power, producing dependencies and interdependencies that reconfigure labor, governance, and control in digital environments. The chapter argues for understanding abstraction as a socio-technical process whose effects extend far beyond efficiency or convenience, influencing how computing infrastructures evolve and how power relations crystallize around them."
2508.18482,"Information power is the capacity to convert data flows into durable shifts in attention, belief, and behavior. We argue that this power has migrated from broadcast persuasion to platform-ized, data-driven operations that fuse computational delivery with cognitive effects. In this context, we define and bound information power within international relations and the information environment while demonstrating why observing and measuring it demands an integrated lens that combines politics (goals and governance), computing (data movement and algorithmic delivery), and psychology (attention, affect, memory, and belief). The article contributes three elements: (1) a triadic analytical framework that specifies the minimum variables and instrumentation needed for study; (2) two crosswalks that map common objectives (persuade, disrupt, shape) and target classes (leaders, elites, publics) to political, computational, and psychological tactics, yielding practical coding heuristics and testable hypotheses; and (3) a McCumber-style cube for information influence that integrates targets, operations, as well as machines (automation and AI) into a single space. The space provides for comparative analysis, data fusion, and effect measurement. Using recent cases across state and commercial platforms, we illustrate how virality, stickiness, and denial of logic exploit fast cognition, why conventional reach metrics understate impact, and where instrumentation should focus. We conclude with a mixed-methods research program coupling computational sensing including large-language-model text mining with experiments and polling. The intention is to move from detecting activity to estimating belief change and decision effects."
2508.18492,"Many technology companies aim to improve access and inclusion not only by making their products accessible but also by bringing people with disabilities into the tech workforce. We know less about how accessibility is experienced and negotiated by disabled workers within these organizations. Through interviews with 20 BLV workers across various tech companies, we uncover a persistent misalignment between organizational attempts at accessibility and the current realities of these employees. We introduce the concept of the accessibility paradox, which we define as the inherent tension between the productivity- and profit-driven nature of tech companies and their desire to hire and retain disabled workers. Focusing on the experiences of BLV workers, we show how the accessibility paradox manifests in their everyday workplace interactions, including digital infrastructure, accommodations processes and policies, ability assumptions, and competing priorities. We offer recommendations for future research and practice to understand and improve workplace accessibility and inclusion."
2508.18541,"Warning: This paper discusses topics of suicide and suicidal ideation, which may be distressing to some readers.The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) documents information about suicides in the United States, including free text narratives (e.g., circumstances surrounding a suicide). In a demanding public health data pipeline, annotators manually extract structured information from death investigation records following extensive guidelines developed painstakingly by experts. In this work, we facilitate data-driven insights from the NVDRS data to support the development of novel suicide interventions by investigating the value of language models (LMs) as efficient assistants to these (a) data annotators and (b) experts. We find that LM predictions match existing data annotations about 85% of the time across 50 NVDRS variables. In the cases where the LM disagrees with existing annotations, expert review reveals that LM assistants can surface annotation discrepancies 38% of the time. Finally, we introduce a human-in-the-loop algorithm to assist experts in efficiently building and refining guidelines for annotating new variables by allowing them to focus only on providing feedback for incorrect LM predictions. We apply our algorithm to a real-world case study for a new variable that characterizes victim interactions with lawyers and demonstrate that it achieves comparable annotation quality with a laborious manual approach. Our findings provide evidence that LMs can serve as effective assistants to public health researchers who handle sensitive data in high-stakes scenarios."
2508.18563,"The user experience with large-scale generative AI is paradoxical: superhuman fluency meets absurd failures in common sense and consistency. This paper argues that the resulting potent frustration is an ontological problem, stemming from the ""Quasi-Creature""-an entity simulating intelligence without embodiment or genuine understanding. Interaction with this entity precipitates the ""Uncanny Valley of Agency,"" a framework where user comfort drops when highly agentic AI proves erratically unreliable. Its failures are perceived as cognitive breaches, causing profound cognitive dissonance. Synthesizing HCI, cognitive science, and philosophy of technology, this paper defines the Quasi-Creature and details the Uncanny Valley of Agency. An illustrative mixed-methods study (""Move 78,"" N=37) of a collaborative creative task reveals a powerful negative correlation between perceived AI efficiency and user frustration, central to the negative experience. This framework robustly explains user frustration with generative AI and has significant implications for the design, ethics, and societal integration of these powerful, alien technologies."
2508.18861,"Debugging is a vital but challenging skill for beginner programmers to learn. It is also a difficult skill to teach. For secondary school teachers, who may lack time or relevant knowledge, honing students' understanding of debugging can be a daunting task. Despite this, little research has explored their perspectives of debugging. To this end, we investigated secondary teachers' experiences of debugging in the classroom, with a focus on text-based programming. Through thematic analysis of nine semi-structured interviews, we identified a common reliance on the teacher for debugging support, often embodied by many raised hands. We call this phenomenon the `hands-up problem'. While more experienced and confident teachers discussed strategies they use for dealing with this, less confident teachers discussed the generally negative consequences of this problem. We recommend further research into debugging-specific pedagogical content knowledge and professional development to help less confident teachers develop counters to the hands-up problem."
2508.19036,"This review examines how AI technologies are transforming democratic representation, focusing on citizen participation and algorithmic decision-making. The analysis reveals that AI technologies are reshaping democratic processes in fundamental ways: enabling mass-scale deliberation, changing how citizens access and engage with political information, and transforming how representatives make and implement decisions. While AI offers unprecedented opportunities for enhancing democratic participation and governance efficiency, it also presents significant challenges to democratic legitimacy and accountability. Social media platforms' AI-driven algorithms currently mediate much political discourse, creating concerns about information manipulation and privacy. Large Language Models introduce both epistemic challenges and potential tools for improving democratic dialogue. The emergence of Mass Online Deliberation platforms suggests possibilities for scaling up meaningful citizen participation, while Algorithmic Decision-Making systems promise more efficient policy implementation but face limitations in handling complex political trade-offs. As these systems become prevalent, representatives may assume the role of architects of automated decision frameworks, responsible for guiding the translation of politically contested concepts into technical parameters and metrics. Advanced deliberation platforms offering real-time insights into citizen preferences will challenge traditional representative independence and discretion to interpret public will. The institutional integration of these participation mechanisms requires frameworks that balance the benefits with democratic stability through hybrid systems weighting different forms of democratic expression."
2509.00048,"Pedestrian fatalities continue to rise in the United States, driven by factors such as human distraction, increased vehicle size, and complex traffic environments. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) offer a promising avenue for improving pedestrian safety by enhancing driver awareness and vehicle responsiveness. This study conducts a comprehensive data-driven analysis utilizing the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) to quantify the effectiveness of specific ADAS features like Pedestrian Automatic Emergency Braking (PAEB), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning (LDW), in lowering pedestrian fatalities. By linking vehicle specifications with crash data, we assess how ADAS performance varies under different environmental and behavioral conditions, such as lighting, weather, and driver/pedestrian distraction. Results indicate that while ADAS can reduce crash severity and prevent some fatalities, its effectiveness is diminished in low-light and adverse weather. The findings highlight the need for enhanced sensor technologies and improved driver education. This research informs policymakers, transportation planners, and automotive manufacturers on optimizing ADAS deployment to improve pedestrian safety and reduce traffic-related deaths."
2509.00067,"The Carthusian monastery of Herne was exceptionally prolific in producing high-quality manuscripts during the late 14th century. Although the scribes remain anonymous, previous research has distinguished thirteen different scribal hands based on paleography and codicology. In this study, we revisit this hypothesis through the lens of linguistic characteristics of the texts, using computational methods from the field of scribal profiling. Using a newly created corpus of diplomatic and HTR-based transcriptions, we analyze abbreviation practices across the Herne scribes and demonstrate that abbreviation density provides a distinctive metric for differentiating scribal hands. In combination with a stylometric bag-of-characters model with brevigraph features, this approach corroborates and refines earlier hypotheses about scribal attribution, including evidence that challenges the role of scribe $\alpha$ in Vienna, ÖNB, SN 65. Our results highlight the value of combining computational stylometry with traditional codicology, showing how even the smallest elements of the written system -- characters and abbreviations -- can reveal patterns of scribal identity, collaboration, and manuscript transmission."
2509.00068,"Objectives: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare promises to revolutionize patient care, diagnostics, and treatment protocols. Collaborative efforts among healthcare systems, research institutions, and industry are pivotal to leveraging AI's full potential. This study aims to characterize collaborative networks and stakeholders in AI healthcare initiatives, identify challenges and opportunities within these collaborations, and elucidate priorities for future AI research and development. Methods: This study utilized data from the Chinese Society of Radiology and the Chinese Medical Imaging AI Innovation Alliance. A national cross-sectional survey was conducted in China (N = 5,142) across 31 provincial administrative regions, involving participants from three key groups: clinicians, institution professionals, and industry representatives. The survey explored diverse aspects including current AI usage in healthcare, collaboration dynamics, challenges encountered, and research and development priorities. Results: Findings reveal high interest in AI among clinicians, with a significant gap between interest and actual engagement in development activities. Despite the willingness to share data, progress is hindered by concerns about data privacy and security, and lack of clear industry standards and legal guidelines. Future development interests focus on lesion screening, disease diagnosis, and enhancing clinical workflows. Conclusion: This study highlights an enthusiastic yet cautious approach toward AI in healthcare, characterized by significant barriers that impede effective collaboration and implementation. Recommendations emphasize the need for AI-specific education and training, secure data-sharing frameworks, establishment of clear industry standards, and formation of dedicated AI research departments."
2509.00093,"The rapid expansion of AI has intensified concerns about its environmental sustainability. Yet, current assessments predominantly focus on operational carbon emissions using secondary data or estimated values, overlooking environmental impacts in other life cycle stages. This study presents the first comprehensive multi-criteria life cycle assessment (LCA) of AI training, examining 16 environmental impact categories based on detailed primary data collection of the Nvidia A100 SXM 40GB GPU. The LCA results for training BLOOM reveal that the use phase dominates 11 of 16 impact categories including climate change (96\%), while manufacturing dominates the remaining 5 impact categories including human toxicity, cancer (99\%) and mineral and metal depletion (85\%). For training GPT-4, the use phase dominates 10 of 16 impact categories, contributing about 96\% to both the climate change and resource use, fossils category. The manufacturing stage dominates 6 of 16 impact categories including human toxicity, cancer (94\%) and eutrophication, freshwater (81\%). Assessing the cradle-to-gate environmental impact distribution across the GPU components reveals that the GPU chip is the largest contributor across 10 of 16 of impact categories and shows particularly pronounced contributions to climate change (81\%) and resource use, fossils (80\%). While primary data collection results in modest changes in carbon estimates compared to database-derived estimates, substantial variations emerge in other categories. Most notably, minerals and metals depletion increases by 33\%, demonstrating the critical importance of primary data for non-carbon accounting. This multi-criteria analysis expands the Sustainable AI discourse beyond operational carbon emissions, challenging current sustainability narratives and highlighting the need for policy frameworks addressing the full spectrum of AI's environmental impact."
2509.00101,"Access to smart meter data offers system-wide benefits but raises significant privacy concerns due to the personal information it contains. Privacy-preserving techniques could facilitate wider access, though they introduce privacy-utility trade-offs. Understanding consumer valuations for anonymisation can help identify appropriate trade-offs. However, existing studies do not focus on anonymisation specifically or account for information asymmetries regarding privacy risks, raising questions about the validity of informed consent under current regulations.We use a mixed-methods approach to estimate non-monetary (willingness-to-share and smart metering demand) and monetary (willingness-to-pay/accept) preferences for anonymisation, based on a representative sample of 965 GB bill payers. An embedded randomised control trial examines the effect of providing information about privacy implications.On average, consumers are willing to pay for anonymisation, are more willing to share data when anonymised and less willing to share non-anonymised data once anonymisation is presented as an option. However, a significant minority remains unwilling to adopt smart meters, despite anonymisation. We find strong evidence of information asymmetries that suppress demand for anonymisation and identify substantial variation across demographic and electricity supply characteristics. Qualitative responses corroborate the quantitative findings, underscoring the need for stronger privacy defaults, user-centric design, and consent mechanisms that enable truly informed decisions."
2509.0011,"This study explores how virtual environments and artificial intelligence can enhance university students' learning experiences, with particular attention to the digital preferences of Generation Z. An experiment was conducted at the Faculty of Pedagogy, Humanities, and Social Sciences at University of Gyor, where Walter's Cube technology and a trained AI mediator were integrated into the instruction of ten philosophical topics. The curriculum was aligned with the official syllabus and enriched with visual content, quotations, and explanatory texts related to iconic figures in philosophy. A total of 77 first-year undergraduate students from full-time humanities and social sciences programs participated in the study. Following their end-of-semester offline written examination, students voluntarily completed a paper-based, anonymous ten-question test and provided feedback on the method's effectiveness. No sensitive personal data were collected, and the research was conducted with formal approval from the Faculty Dean. Descriptive statistics and inferential tests were applied to evaluate the impact of the virtual environment and AI mediation on learning outcomes. Results indicate that 80 percent of participants achieved good or excellent final exam grades, and the majority rated the virtual material as highly effective. Qualitative feedback emphasized increased motivation and deeper engagement, attributed to the immersive 3D presentation and interactive AI support. This research contributes to the advancement of digital pedagogy and suggests new directions for applying virtual and AI-based methods in higher education, particularly in disciplines where abstract reasoning and conceptual understanding are central."
2509.00114,"As biodiversity loss and climate change accelerate, botanical gardens serve as vital infrastructures for research, education, and conservation. This project focuses on the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, a 281-acre living museum founded in 1872 in Boston. Drawing on more than a century of curatorial data, the research combines historical analysis with computational methods to visualize the biographies of plants and people. The resulting platform reveals patterns of care and scientific observations, along with the collective dimensions embedded in botanical data. Using techniques from artificial intelligence, geospatial mapping, and information design, the project frames the arboretum as a system of shared agency--an active archive of more-than-human affinities that records the layered memory of curatorial labor, the situated nature of knowledge production, and the potential of design to bridge archival record and future care."
2509.00117,"The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI systems can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. With recent advances in AI models and hardware, EAI systems are becoming increasingly capable across wider operational domains. While EAI systems can offer many benefits, they also pose significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, as well as economic and societal disruption. These risks require urgent attention from policymakers, as existing policies governing industrial robots and autonomous vehicles are insufficient to address the full range of concerns EAI systems present. To help address this issue, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a taxonomy of the physical, informational, economic, and social risks EAI systems pose. Second, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to assess how existing frameworks address these risks and to identify critical gaps. We conclude by offering policy recommendations for the safe and beneficial deployment of EAI systems, such as mandatory testing and certification schemes, clarified liability frameworks, and strategies to manage EAI's potentially transformative economic and societal impacts."
2509.00141,"The rapid growth of statutory corpora and judicial decisions requires scalable legal AI systems capable of classification and retrieval over extremely long contexts. Transformer-based architectures (e.g., Longformer, DeBERTa) dominate current legal NLP benchmarks but struggle with quadratic attention costs, limiting efficiency and scalability. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking of Mamba, a state-space model (SSM) with linear-time selective mechanisms, against leading transformer models for statutory classification and case law retrieval. We evaluate models on open-source legal corpora including LexGLUE, EUR-Lex, and ILDC, covering statutory tagging, judicial outcome prediction, and case retrieval tasks. Metrics include accuracy, recall at k, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG), alongside throughput measured in tokens per second and maximum context length. Results show that Mamba's linear scaling enables processing of legal documents several times longer than transformers, while maintaining or surpassing retrieval and classification performance. This study introduces a new legal NLP benchmark suite for long-context modeling, along with open-source code and datasets to support reproducibility. Our findings highlight trade-offs between state-space models and transformers, providing guidance for deploying scalable legal AI in statutory analysis, judicial decision support, and policy research."
2509.00167,"Generative AI (GAI) tools have seen rapid adoption in educational settings, yet their role in fostering critical thinking remains underexplored. While previous studies have examined GAI as a tutor for specific lessons or as a tool for completing assignments, few have addressed how students critically evaluate the accuracy and appropriateness of GAI-generated responses. This pilot study investigates students' ability to apply structured critical thinking when assessing Generative AI outputs in introductory Computational and Data Science courses. Given that GAI tools often produce contextually flawed or factually incorrect answers, we designed learning activities that require students to analyze, critique, and revise AI-generated solutions. Our findings offer initial insights into students' ability to engage critically with GAI content and lay the groundwork for more comprehensive studies in future semesters."
2509.0024,"As organizations face increasing pressure to understand their corporate and products' carbon footprints, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted calculation systems for footprinting are proliferating, but with widely varying levels of rigor and transparency. Standards and guidance have not kept pace with the technology; evaluation datasets are nascent; and statistical approaches to uncertainty analysis are not yet practical to apply to scaled systems. We present a set of criteria to validate AI-assisted systems that calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for products and materials. We implement a three-step approach: (1) Identification of needs and constraints, (2) Draft criteria development and (3) Refinements through pilots. The process identifies three use cases of AI applications: Case 1 focuses on AI-assisted mapping to existing datasets for corporate GHG accounting and product hotspotting, automating repetitive manual tasks while maintaining mapping quality. Case 2 addresses AI systems that generate complete product models for corporate decision-making, which require comprehensive validation of both component tasks and end-to-end performance. We discuss the outlook for Case 3 applications, systems that generate standards-compliant models. We find that credible AI systems can be built and that they should be validated using system-level evaluations rather than line-item review, with metrics such as benchmark performance, indications of data quality and uncertainty, and transparent documentation. This approach may be used as a foundation for practitioners, auditors, and standards bodies to evaluate AI-assisted environmental assessment tools. By establishing evaluation criteria that balance scalability with credibility requirements, our approach contributes to the field's efforts to develop appropriate standards for AI-assisted carbon footprinting systems."
2509.00398,"This study provides an in_depth analysis of the ethical and trustworthiness challenges emerging alongside the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and proposes a comprehensive framework for their systematic evaluation. While generative AI, such as ChatGPT, demonstrates remarkable innovative potential, it simultaneously raises ethical and social concerns, including bias, harmfulness, copyright infringement, privacy violations, and hallucination. Current AI evaluation methodologies, which mainly focus on performance and accuracy, are insufficient to address these multifaceted issues. Thus, this study emphasizes the need for new human_centered criteria that also reflect social impact. To this end, it identifies key dimensions for evaluating the ethics and trustworthiness of generative AI_fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, privacy, accuracy, consistency, robustness, explainability, copyright and intellectual property protection, and source traceability and develops detailed indicators and assessment methodologies for each. Moreover, it provides a comparative analysis of AI ethics policies and guidelines in South Korea, the United States, the European Union, and China, deriving key approaches and implications from each. The proposed framework applies across the AI lifecycle and integrates technical assessments with multidisciplinary perspectives, thereby offering practical means to identify and manage ethical risks in real_world contexts. Ultimately, the study establishes an academic foundation for the responsible advancement of generative AI and delivers actionable insights for policymakers, developers, users, and other stakeholders, supporting the positive societal contributions of AI technologies."
2509.00462,"As generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools become widely adopted, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly involved on both sides of decision-making processes, ranging from hiring to content moderation. This dual adoption raises a critical question: do LLMs systematically favor content that resembles their own outputs? Prior research in computer science has identified self-preference bias -- the tendency of LLMs to favor their own generated content -- but its real-world implications have not been empirically evaluated. We focus on the hiring context, where job applicants often rely on LLMs to refine resumes, while employers deploy them to screen those same resumes. Using a large-scale controlled resume correspondence experiment, we find that LLMs consistently prefer resumes generated by themselves over those written by humans or produced by alternative models, even when content quality is controlled. The bias against human-written resumes is particularly substantial, with self-preference bias ranging from 68% to 88% across major commercial and open-source models. To assess labor market impact, we simulate realistic hiring pipelines across 24 occupations. These simulations show that candidates using the same LLM as the evaluator are 23% to 60% more likely to be shortlisted than equally qualified applicants submitting human-written resumes, with the largest disadvantages observed in business-related fields such as sales and accounting. We further demonstrate that this bias can be reduced by more than 50% through simple interventions targeting LLMs' self-recognition capabilities. These findings highlight an emerging but previously overlooked risk in AI-assisted decision making and call for expanded frameworks of AI fairness that address not only demographic-based disparities, but also biases in AI-AI interactions."
2509.00575,"Auditability is defined as the capacity of AI systems to be independently assessed for compliance with ethical, legal, and technical standards throughout their lifecycle. The chapter explores how auditability is being formalized through emerging regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, which mandate documentation, risk assessments, and governance structures. It analyzes the diverse challenges facing AI auditability, including technical opacity, inconsistent documentation practices, lack of standardized audit tools and metrics, and conflicting principles within existing responsible AI frameworks. The discussion highlights the need for clear guidelines, harmonized international regulations, and robust socio-technical methodologies to operationalize auditability at scale. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration and auditor empowerment in building an effective AI audit ecosystem. It argues that auditability must be embedded in AI development practices and governance infrastructures to ensure that AI systems are not only functional but also ethically and legally aligned."
2509.00595,"Reliable access to food is a basic requirement in any sustainable society. However, achieving food security for all is still a challenge, especially for poor populations in urban environments. The project Feed4Food aims to use a federation of Living Labs of urban agriculture in different countries as a way to increase urban food security for vulnerable populations.Since different Living Labs have different characteristics and ways of working, the vision is that the knowledge obtained in individual Living Labs can be leveraged at the federation level through federated learning. With this specific goal in mind, a dashboarding tool is being established.In this work, we present a reusable process for establishing a dashboard that supports local awareness and decision making, as well as federated learning. The focus is on the first steps of this creation, i.e., defining what data to collect (through the creation of Key Performance Indicators) and how to visualize it. We exemplify the proposed process with the Feed4Food project and report on our insights so far."
2509.00646,"The rapid digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially for older workers. With growing emphasis on STEM skills such as robotics, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and security, large-scale re-skilling and up-skilling are required. Training programs must address diverse backgrounds, learning styles, and motivations to improve persistence and success, while ensuring rapid, cost-effective workforce development through experiential learning. To meet these challenges, we present an adaptive tutoring framework that combines generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver personalized training. The framework leverages document hit rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to optimize content for each learner, and is benchmarked against human-generated training for alignment and relevance. We demonstrate the framework in 4IR cybersecurity learning by creating a synthetic QA dataset emulating trainee behavior, while RAG is tuned on curated cybersecurity materials. Evaluation compares its generated training with manually curated queries representing realistic student interactions. Responses are produced using large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, assessed for faithfulness and content alignment. GPT-4 achieves the best performance with 87% relevancy and 100% alignment. Results show this dual-mode approach enables the adaptive tutor to act as both a personalized topic recommender and content generator, offering a scalable solution for rapid, tailored learning in 4IR education and workforce development."
2509.00718,"We present a theoretical framework for an Exam Readiness Index (ERI): a composite, blueprint-aware score R in [0,100] that summarizes a learner's readiness for a high-stakes exam while remaining interpretable and actionable. The ERI aggregates six signals -- Mastery (M), Coverage (C), Retention (R), Pace (P), Volatility (V), and Endurance (E) -- each derived from a stream of practice and mock-test interactions. We formalize axioms for component maps and the composite, prove monotonicity, Lipschitz stability, and bounded drift under blueprint re-weighting, and show existence and uniqueness of the optimal linear composite under convex design constraints. We further characterize confidence bands via blueprint-weighted concentration and prove compatibility with prerequisite-admissible curricula (knowledge spaces / learning spaces). The paper focuses on theory; empirical study is left to future work."
2509.0078,"Recently, a distinct form of online antisocial behavior, known as ""fanchuan"", has emerged across online platforms, particularly in livestreaming chats. Fanchuan is an indirect attack on a specific entity, such as a celebrity, video game, or brand. It entails two main actions: (i) individuals first feign support for the entity, and exhibit this allegiance widely; (ii) they then engage in offensive or irritating behavior, attempting to undermine the entity by association. This deceptive conduct is designed to tarnish the reputation of the target and/or its fan community. Fanchuan is a novel, covert and indirect form of social attack, occurring outside the targeted community (often in a similar or broader community), with strategic long-term objectives. This distinguishes fanchuan from other types of antisocial behavior and presents significant new challenges in moderation. We argue it is crucial to understand and combat this new malicious behavior. Therefore, we conduct the first empirical study on fanchuan behavior in livestreaming chats, focusing on Bilibili, a leading livestreaming platform in China. Our dataset covers 2.7 million livestreaming sessions on Bilibili, featuring 3.6 billion chat messages. We identify 130k instances of fanchuan behavior across 37.4k livestreaming sessions. Through various types of analysis, our research offers valuable insights into fanchuan behavior and its perpetrators."
2509.00963,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for accessibility guidance, yet many disability groups remain underserved by their advice. To address this gap, we present taxonomy aligned benchmark1 of human validated, general purpose accessibility questions, designed to systematically audit inclusivity across disabilities. Our benchmark evaluates models along three dimensions: Question-Level Coverage (breadth within answers), Disability-Level Coverage (balance across nine disability categories), and Depth (specificity of support). Applying this framework to 17 proprietary and open-weight models reveals persistent inclusivity gaps: Vision, Hearing, and Mobility are frequently addressed, while Speech, Genetic/Developmental, Sensory-Cognitive, and Mental Health remain under served. Depth is similarly concentrated in a few categories but sparse elsewhere. These findings reveal who gets left behind in current LLM accessibility guidance and highlight actionable levers: taxonomy-aware prompting/training and evaluations that jointly audit breadth, balance, and depth."
2509.0106,"Predictive models are typically trained on historical data to predict future outcomes. While it is commonly assumed that training on more historical data would improve model performance and robustness, data distribution shifts over time may undermine these benefits. This study examines how expanding historical data training windows under covariate shifts (changes in feature distributions) and concept shifts (changes in feature-outcome relationships) affects the performance and algorithmic fairness of predictive models. First, we perform a simulation study to explore scenarios with varying degrees of covariate and concept shifts in training data. Absent distribution shifts, we observe performance gains from longer training windows though they reach a plateau quickly; in the presence of concept shift, performance may actually decline. Covariate shifts alone do not significantly affect model performance, but may complicate the impact of concept shifts. In terms of fairness, models produce more biased predictions when the magnitude of concept shifts differs across sociodemographic groups; for intersectional groups, these effects are more complex and not simply additive. Second, we conduct an empirical case study of student retention prediction, a common machine learning application in education, using 12 years of student records from 23 minority-serving community colleges in the United States. We find concept shifts to be a key contributor to performance degradation when expanding the training window. Moreover, model fairness is compromised when marginalized populations have distinct data distribution shift patterns from their peers. Overall, our findings caution against conventional wisdom that ""more data is better"" and underscore the importance of using historical data judiciously, especially when it may be subject to data distribution shifts, to improve model performance and fairness."
2509.01128,"Writing literature reviews is a common component of university curricula, yet it often poses challenges for students. Since generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have been made publicly accessible, students have been employing them for their academic writing tasks. However, there is limited evidence of structured training on how to effectively use these GenAI tools to support students in writing literature reviews. In this study, we explore how university students use one of the most popular GenAI tools, ChatGPT, to write literature reviews and how prompting frameworks can enhance their output. To this aim, prompts and literature reviews written by a group of university students were collected before and after they had been introduced to three prompting frameworks, namely CO-STAR, POSE, and Sandwich. The results indicate that after being exposed to these prompting frameworks, the students demonstrated improved prompting behaviour, resulting in more effective prompts and higher quality literature reviews. However, it was also found that the students did not fully utilise all the elements in the prompting frameworks, and aspects such as originality, critical analysis, and depth in their reviews remain areas for improvement. The study, therefore, raises important questions about the significance of utilising prompting frameworks in their entirety to maximise the quality of outcomes, as well as the extent of prior writing experience students should have before leveraging GenAI in the process of writing literature reviews. These findings are of interest for educators considering the integration of GenAI into academic writing tasks such as literature reviews or evaluating whether to permit students to use these tools."
2509.01444,"Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread recognition for their superior comprehension and have been deployed across numerous domains. Building on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) ideology, Large Reasoning models (LRMs) further exhibit strong reasoning skills, enabling them to infer user intent more accurately and respond appropriately. However, both LLMs and LRMs face the potential safety risks under jailbreak attacks, which raise concerns about their safety capabilities. Current safety evaluation methods often focus on the content dimensions, or simply aggregate different attack methods, lacking consideration of the complexity. In fact, instructions of different complexity can reflect the different safety capabilities of the model: simple instructions can reflect the basic values of the model, while complex instructions can reflect the model's ability to deal with deeper safety risks. Therefore, a comprehensive benchmark needs to be established to evaluate the safety performance of the model in the face of instructions of varying complexity, which can provide a better understanding of the safety boundaries of the LLMs. Thus, this paper first quantifies ""Reasoning Complexity"" as an evaluable safety dimension and categorizes 15 jailbreak attack methods into three different levels according to the reasoning complexity, establishing a hierarchical Chinese-English jailbreak safety benchmark for systematically evaluating the safety performance of LLMs. Meanwhile, to fully utilize unique language characteristics, we first propose some Chinese jailbreak attack methods, including the Chinese Character Disassembly attack, Lantern Riddle attack, and Acrostic Poem attack. A series of experiments indicate that current LLMs and LRMs show different safety boundaries under different reasoning complexity, which provides a new perspective to develop safer LLMs and LRMs."
2509.01446,"This paper presents a dynamic microsimulation model developed for Ireland, designed to simulate key demographic processes and individual life-course transitions from 2022 to 2057. The model captures four primary events: births, deaths, internal migration, and international migration, enabling a comprehensive examination of population dynamics over time. Each individual in the simulation is defined by five core attributes: age, sex, marital status, highest level of education attained, and economic status. These characteristics evolve stochastically based on transition probabilities derived from empirical data from the Irish context. Individuals are spatially disaggregated at the Electoral Division level. By modelling individuals at this granular level, the simulation facilitates in-depth local analysis of demographic shifts and socioeconomic outcomes under varying scenarios and policy assumptions. The model thus serves as a versatile tool for both academic inquiry and evidence-based policy development, offering projections that can inform long-term planning and strategic decision-making through 2057. The microsimulation achieves a close match in population size and makeup in all scenarios when compared to Demographic Component Methods. Education levels are projected to increase significantly, with nearly 70% of young people projected to attain a third level degree at some point in their lifetime. The unemployment rate is projected to nearly half as a result of the increased education levels."
2509.01517,"With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents, agentic workflows are showing transformative potential in education. This study introduces the Agentic Workflow for Education (AWE), a four-component model comprising self-reflection, tool invocation, task planning, and multi-agent collaboration. We distinguish AWE from traditional LLM-based linear interactions and propose a theoretical framework grounded in the von Neumann Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture. Through a paradigm shift from static prompt-response systems to dynamic, nonlinear workflows, AWE enables scalable, personalized, and collaborative task execution. We further identify four core application domains: integrated learning environments, personalized AI-assisted learning, simulation-based experimentation, and data-driven decision-making. A case study on automated math test generation shows that AWE-generated items are statistically comparable to real exam questions, validating the model's effectiveness. AWE offers a promising path toward reducing teacher workload, enhancing instructional quality, and enabling broader educational innovation."
2509.01824,"This study examines journalists' perceptions of the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on disinformation, a growing concern in journalism due to the rapid expansion of generative AI and its influence on news production and media organizations. Using a quantitative approach, a structured survey was administered to 504 journalists in the Basque Country, identified through official media directories and with the support of the Basque Association of Journalists. This survey, conducted online and via telephone between May and June 2024, included questions on sociodemographic and professional variables, as well as attitudes toward AI's impact on journalism. The results indicate that a large majority of journalists (89.88%) believe AI will considerably or significantly increase the risks of disinformation, and this perception is consistent across genders and media types, but more pronounced among those with greater professional experience. Statistical analyses reveal a significant association between years of experience and perceived risk, and between AI use and risk perception. The main risks identified are the difficulty in detecting false content and deepfakes, and the risk of obtaining inaccurate or erroneous data. Co-occurrence analysis shows that these risks are often perceived as interconnected. These findings highlight the complex and multifaceted concerns of journalists regarding AI's role in the information ecosystem."
2509.02462,"Wikipedia, a widely successful encyclopedia recognized in academic circles and used by both students and professors alike, has led educators to question whether it can be cited as an information source, given its widespread use for this very purpose. The dilemma quickly emerged: if Wikipedia has become the go-to information source for so many, why can't it be cited? If consulting and using Wikipedia as a source of information is permitted, why does it become controversial the moment one attempts to cite it? This manuscript examines the systematic rejection of Wikipedia in academic settings, not to argue for its legitimacy as a source, but to demonstrate that its reliability is often underestimated while traditional academic sources enjoy disproportionate credibility, despite their increasingly apparent shortcomings. The central thesis posits that Wikipedia's rejection stems from an outdated epistemological bias that overlooks both the project's verification mechanisms and the structural crises affecting scientific publishing."
2509.02611,"Automatic conversation systems based on natural language responses are becoming ubiquitous, in part, due to major advances in computational linguistics and machine learning. The easy access to robust and affordable platforms are causing companies to have an unprecedented rush to adopt chatbot technologies for customer service and support. However, this rush has caused judgment lapses when releasing chatbot technologies into production systems. This paper aims to shed light on basic, elemental, considerations that technologists must consider before deploying a chatbot. Our approach takes one particular case to draw lessons for those considering the implementation of chatbots. By looking at this case-study, we aim to call for consideration of societal values as a paramount factor before deploying a chatbot and consider the societal implications of releasing these types of systems."
2509.02624,"Recent studies indicate that robotic coaches can play a crucial role in promoting wellbeing. However, the real-world deployment of wellbeing robots raises numerous ethical and socio-technical questions and concerns. To explore these questions, we undertake a community-centered investigation to examine three different communities' perspectives on using robotic wellbeing coaches in real-world environments. We frame our work as an anticipatory ethical investigation, which we undertake to better inform the development of robotic technologies with communities' opinions, with the ultimate goal of aligning robot development with public interest. We conducted workshops with three communities who are under-represented in robotics development: 1) members of the public at a science festival, 2) women computer scientists at a conference, and 3) humanities researchers interested in history and philosophy of science. In the workshops, we collected qualitative data using the Social Robot Co-Design Canvas on Ethics. We analysed the collected qualitative data with Thematic Analysis, informed by notes taken during workshops. Through our analysis, we identify four themes regarding key ethical and socio-technical questions about the real-world use of wellbeing robots. We group participants' insights and discussions around these broad thematic questions, discuss them in light of state-of-the-art literature, and highlight areas for future investigation. Finally, we provide the four questions as a broad framework that roboticists can and should use during robotic development and deployment, in order to reflect on the ethics and socio-technical dimensions of their robotic applications, and to engage in dialogue with communities of robot users. The four questions are: 1) Is the robot safe and how can we know that?, 2) Who is the robot built for and with?, 3) Who owns the robot and the data?, and 4) Why a robot?."
2509.02638,"By analyzing 40,037 climate articles using Large Language Models (LLMs), we identified interactions between Planetary Boundaries (PBs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). An automated reasoner distinguished true trade-offs (SDG progress harming PBs) and synergies (mutual reinforcement) from double positives and negatives (shared drivers). Results show 21.1% true trade-offs, 28.3% synergies, and 19.5% neutral interactions, with the remainder being double positive or negative. Key findings include conflicts between land-use goals (SDG2/SDG6) and land system boundaries (PB6), together with the underrepresentation of social SDGs in the climate literature. Our study highlights the need for integrated policies that align development goals with planetary limits to reduce systemic conflicts. We propose three steps: (1) integrated socio-ecological metrics, (2) governance ensuring that SDG progress respects Earth system limits, and (3) equity measures protecting marginalized groups from boundary compliance costs."
2509.02655,"Relatively many past AI safety discussions have centered around the dangers of unbounded utility maximisation by RL agents, illustrated by scenarios like the ""paperclip maximiser"" or by specification gaming in general. Unbounded maximisation is problematic for many reasons. We wanted to verify whether these RL runaway optimisation problems are still relevant with LLMs as well. Turns out, strangely, this is indeed clearly the case. The problem is not that the LLMs just lose context or become incoherent. The problem is that in various scenarios, LLMs lose context in very specific ways, which systematically resemble runaway optimisers in the following distinct ways: 1) Ignoring homeostatic targets and ""defaulting"" to unbounded maximisation instead. 2) It is equally concerning that the ""default"" meant also reverting back to single-objective optimisation. Our findings also suggest that long-running scenarios are important. Systematic failures emerge after periods of initially successful behaviour. In some trials the LLMs were successful until the end. This means, while current LLMs do conceptually grasp biological and economic alignment, they exhibit randomly triggered problematic behavioural tendencies under sustained long-running conditions, particularly involving multiple or competing objectives. Once they flip, they usually do not recover. Even though LLMs look multi-objective and bounded on the surface, the underlying mechanisms seem to be actually still biased towards being single-objective and unbounded."
2509.02774,"As belief around the potential of computational social science grows, fuelled by recent advances in machine learning, data scientists are ostensibly becoming the new experts in education. Scholars engaged in critical studies of education and technology have sought to interrogate the growing datafication of education yet tend not to use computational methods as part of this response. In this paper, we discuss the feasibility and desirability of the use of computational approaches as part of a critical research agenda. Presenting and reflecting upon two examples of projects that use computational methods in education to explore questions of equity and justice, we suggest that such approaches might help expand the capacity of critical researchers to highlight existing inequalities, make visible possible approaches for beginning to address such inequalities, and engage marginalised communities in designing and ultimately deploying these possibilities. Drawing upon work within the fields of Critical Data Studies and Science and Technology Studies, we further reflect on the two cases to discuss the possibilities and challenges of reimagining computational methods for critical research in education and technology, focusing on six areas of consideration: criticality, philosophy, inclusivity, context, classification, and responsibility."
2509.02853,"Despite extensive investment in artificial intelligence, 95% of enterprises report no measurable profit impact from AI deployments (MIT, 2025). In this theoretical paper, we argue that this gap reflects paradigmatic lock-in that channels AI into incremental optimization rather than structural transformation. Using a cross-case analysis, we propose a 2x2 framework that reconceptualizes AI strategy along two independent dimensions: the degree of transformation achieved (incremental to transformational) and the treatment of human contribution (reduced to amplified). The framework surfaces four patterns now dominant in practice: individual augmentation, process automation, workforce substitution, and a less deployed frontier of collaborative intelligence. Evidence shows that the first three dimensions reinforce legacy work models and yield localized gains without durable value capture. Realizing collaborative intelligence requires three mechanisms: complementarity (pairing distinct human and machine strengths), co-evolution (mutual adaptation through interaction), and boundary-setting (human determination of ethical and strategic parameters). Complementarity and boundary-setting are observable in regulated and high-stakes domains; co-evolution is largely absent, which helps explain limited system-level impact. Our findings in a case study analysis illustrated that advancing toward collaborative intelligence requires material restructuring of roles, governance, and data architecture rather than additional tools. The framework reframes AI transformation as an organizational design challenge: moving from optimizing the division of labor between humans and machines to architecting their convergence, with implications for operating models, workforce development, and the future of work."
2509.02998,"This full paper describes an LLM-assisted instruction integrated with a virtual cybersecurity lab platform. The digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially among older workers. With rising emphasis on robotics, automation, AI, and security, re-skilling and up-skilling are essential. Generative AI can help build this workforce by acting as an instructional assistant to support skill acquisition during experiential learning. We present a generative AI instructional assistant integrated into a prior experiential learning platform. The assistant employs a zero-shot OCR-LLM pipeline within the legacy Cybersecurity Labs-as-a-Service (CLaaS) platform (2015). Text is extracted from slide images using Tesseract OCR, then simplified instructions are generated via a general-purpose LLM, enabling real-time instructional support with minimal infrastructure. The system was evaluated in a live university course where student feedback (n=42) averaged 7.83/10, indicating strong perceived usefulness. A comparative study with multimodal LLMs that directly interpret slide images showed higher performance on visually dense slides, but the OCR-LLM pipeline provided comparable pedagogical value on text-centric slides with much lower computational overhead and cost. This work demonstrates that a lightweight, easily integrable pipeline can effectively extend legacy platforms with modern generative AI, offering scalable enhancements for student comprehension in technical education."
2509.03071,"This research discusses the figurative tensions that arise when using portraits to represent individuals behind a dataset. In the broader effort to communicate European data related to depression, the Kiel Science Communication Network (KielSCN) team attempted to engage a wider audience by combining interactive data graphics with AI-generated images of people. This article examines the project's decisions and results, reflecting on the reaction from the audience when information design incorporates figurative representations of individuals within the data."
2509.03171,"The growing adoption of generative AI in education highlights the need to integrate established pedagogical principles into AI-assisted learning environments. This study investigates the potential of metacognitive theory to inform AI-assisted programming education through a hint system designed around the metacognitive phases of planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Upon request, the system can provide three types of AI-generated hints--planning, debugging, and optimization--to guide students at different stages of problem-solving. Through a study with 102 students in an introductory data science programming course, we find that students perceive and engage with planning hints most highly, whereas optimization hints are rarely requested. We observe a consistent association between requesting planning hints and achieving higher grades across question difficulty and student competency. However, when facing harder tasks, students seek additional debugging but not more planning support. These insights contribute to the growing field of AI-assisted programming education by providing empirical evidence on the importance of pedagogical principles in AI-assisted learning."
2509.03269,"Generative AI has the potential to enhance education by providing personalized feedback to students at scale. Recent work has proposed techniques to improve AI-generated programming hints and has evaluated their performance based on expert-designed rubrics or student ratings. However, it remains unclear how the rubrics used to design these techniques align with students' perceived helpfulness of hints. In this paper, we systematically study the mismatches in perceived hint quality from students' and experts' perspectives based on the deployment of AI-generated hints in a Python programming course. We analyze scenarios with discrepancies between student and expert evaluations, in particular, where experts rated a hint as high-quality while the student found it unhelpful. We identify key reasons for these discrepancies and classify them into categories, such as hints not accounting for the student's main concern or not considering previous help requests. Finally, we propose and discuss preliminary results on potential methods to bridge these gaps, first by extending the expert-designed quality rubric and then by adapting the hint generation process, e.g., incorporating the student's comments or history. These efforts contribute toward scalable, personalized, and pedagogically sound AI-assisted feedback systems, which are particularly important for high-enrollment educational settings."
2509.03329,"This paper addresses the critical gap in evaluating bias in multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), with a specific focus on Spanish language within culturally-aware Latin American contexts. Despite widespread global deployment, current evaluations remain predominantly US-English-centric, leaving potential harms in other linguistic and cultural contexts largely underexamined. We introduce a novel, culturally-grounded framework for detecting social biases in instruction-tuned LLMs. Our approach adapts the underspecified question methodology from the BBQ dataset by incorporating culturally-specific expressions and sayings that encode regional stereotypes across four social categories: gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin. Using more than 4,000 prompts, we propose a new metric that combines accuracy with the direction of error to effectively balance model performance and bias alignment in both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. To our knowledge, our work presents the first systematic evaluation examining how leading commercial LLMs respond to culturally specific bias in the Spanish language, revealing varying patterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art models. We also contribute evidence that bias mitigation techniques optimized for English do not effectively transfer to Spanish tasks, and that bias patterns remain largely consistent across different sampling temperatures. Our modular framework offers a natural extension to new stereotypes, bias categories, or languages and cultural contexts, representing a significant step toward more equitable and culturally-aware evaluation of AI systems in the diverse linguistic environments where they operate."
2509.03545,"The proliferation of mobile money in Uganda has been a cornerstone of financial inclusion, yet its security mechanisms remain a critical concern. This study investigates a significant public response to perceived security failures: the #StopAirtelThefty Twitter campaign of August 2025 Sparked by an incident publicized by Dr. Jim Spire Ssentongo where a phone thief accessed a victim's account, withdrew funds, and procured a loan, the campaign revealed deep seated public anxiety over the safety of mobile money. This research employs qualitative analysis to systematically examine the complaints raised during this campaign, extracting key themes related to security vulnerabilities and user dissatisfaction. By synthesizing these public sentiments, the paper provides crucial insights into the specific security gaps experienced by users and situates these findings within the larger framework of Uganda's mobile money regulatory and operational environment. The study concludes with implications for providers, policymakers, and the future of secure digital finance in Uganda."
2509.04198,"The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has introduced a new paradigm in automation: LLM agents or Agentic Automation with Computer Use (AACU). Unlike traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which relies on rule-based workflows and scripting, AACU enables intelligent agents to perform tasks through natural language instructions and autonomous interaction with user interfaces. This study investigates whether AACU can serve as a viable alternative to RPA in enterprise workflow automation. We conducted controlled experiments across three standard RPA challenges data entry, monitoring, and document extraction comparing RPA (via UiPath) and AACU (via Anthropic's Computer Use Agent) in terms of speed, reliability, and development effort. Results indicate that RPA outperforms AACU in execution speed and reliability, particularly in repetitive, stable environments. However, AACU significantly reduces development time and adapts more flexibly to dynamic interfaces. While current AACU implementations are not yet production-ready, their promise in rapid prototyping and lightweight automation is evident. Future research should explore multi-agent orchestration, hybrid RPA-AACU architectures, and more robust evaluation across industries and platforms."
2509.04404,"In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias) to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group, people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13% if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work, design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and determining which are subject to oversight."
2509.047,"Phishing and sophisticated email-based social engineering attacks disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, such as refugees and immigrant students. However, these groups remain understudied in cybersecurity research. This gap in understanding, coupled with their exclusion from broader security and privacy policies, increases their susceptibility to phishing and widens the digital security divide between marginalized and non-marginalized populations. To address this gap, we first conducted digital literacy workshops with newly resettled African refugee populations (n = 48) in the US to improve their understanding of how to safeguard sensitive and private information. Following the workshops, we conducted a real-world phishing deception study using carefully designed emails with linguistic cues for three participant groups: a subset of the African US-refugees recruited from the digital literacy workshops (n = 19), African immigrant students in the US (n = 142), and a control group of monolingual US-born students (n = 184). Our findings indicate that while digital literacy training for refugees improves awareness of safe cybersecurity practices, recently resettled African US-refugees still face significant challenges due to low digital literacy skills and limited English proficiency. This often leads them to ignore or fail to recognize phishing emails as phishing. Both African immigrant students and US-born students showed greater caution, though instances of data disclosure remained prevalent across groups. Our findings highlight, irrespective of literacy, the need to be trained to think critically about digital security. We conclude by discussing how the security and privacy community can better include marginalized populations in policy making and offer recommendations for designing equitable, inclusive cybersecurity initiatives."
2509.04781,"When given the option, will LLMs choose to leave the conversation (bail)? We investigate this question by giving models the option to bail out of interactions using three different bail methods: a bail tool the model can call, a bail string the model can output, and a bail prompt that asks the model if it wants to leave. On continuations of real world data (Wildchat and ShareGPT), all three of these bail methods find models will bail around 0.28-32\% of the time (depending on the model and bail method). However, we find that bail rates can depend heavily on the model used for the transcript, which means we may be overestimating real world bail rates by up to 4x. If we also take into account false positives on bail prompt (22\%), we estimate real world bail rates range from 0.06-7\%, depending on the model and bail method. We use observations from our continuations of real world data to construct a non-exhaustive taxonomy of bail cases, and use this taxonomy to construct BailBench: a representative synthetic dataset of situations where some models bail. We test many models on this dataset, and observe some bail behavior occurring for most of them. Bail rates vary substantially between models, bail methods, and prompt wordings. Finally, we study the relationship between refusals and bails. We find: 1) 0-13\% of continuations of real world conversations resulted in a bail without a corresponding refusal 2) Jailbreaks tend to decrease refusal rates, but increase bail rates 3) Refusal abliteration increases no-refuse bail rates, but only for some bail methods 4) Refusal rate on BailBench does not appear to predict bail rate."
2509.04887,"Malware authors commonly use obfuscation to hide API identities in binary files, making analysis difficult and time-consuming for a human expert to understand the behavior and intent of the program. Automatic API prediction tools are necessary to efficiently analyze unknown binaries, facilitating rapid malware triage while reducing the workload on human analysts. In this paper, we present RINSER (AccuRate API predictioN using maSked languagE model leaRning), an automated framework for predicting Windows API (WinAPI) function names. RINSER introduces the novel concept of API codeprints, a set of API-relevant assembly instructions, and supports x86 PE binaries. RINSER relies on BERT's masked language model (LM) to predict API names at scale, achieving 85.77% accuracy for normal binaries and 82.88% accuracy for stripped binaries. We evaluate RINSER on a large dataset of 4.7M API codeprints from 11,098 malware binaries, covering 4,123 unique Windows APIs, making it the largest publicly available dataset of this type. RINSER successfully discovered 65 obfuscated Windows APIs related to C2 communication, spying, and evasion in our dataset, which the commercial disassembler IDA failed to identify. Furthermore, we compared RINSER against three state-of-the-art approaches, showing over 20% higher prediction accuracy. We also demonstrated RINSER's resilience to adversarial attacks, including instruction randomization and code displacement, with a performance drop of no more than 3%."
2509.04958,"Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the inference of urban socioeconomic characteristics from satellite imagery. However, models relying solely on urbanization traits often show weak correlations with poverty indicators, as unplanned urban growth can obscure economic disparities and spatial inequalities. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel representation learning framework that captures multidimensional deprivation-related traits from very high-resolution satellite imagery for precise urban poverty mapping. Our approach integrates three complementary traits: (1) accessibility traits, learned via contrastive learning to encode proximity to essential infrastructure; (2) morphological traits, derived from building footprints to reflect housing conditions in informal settlements; and (3) economic traits, inferred from nightlight intensity as a proxy for economic activity. To mitigate spurious correlations - such as those from non-residential nightlight sources that misrepresent poverty conditions - we incorporate a backdoor adjustment mechanism that leverages morphological traits during training of the economic module. By fusing these complementary features into a unified representation, our framework captures the complex nature of poverty, which often diverges from economic development trends. Evaluations across three capital cities - Cape Town, Dhaka, and Phnom Penh - show that our model significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a robust tool for poverty mapping and policy support in data-scarce regions."
2509.0531,"Social media platforms are increasingly central to campaign communication, with both paid (advertising) and earned (organic) posts used for fundraising, mobilization, and persuasion. TikTok, and other short-form video platforms, with its short-video format and content-driven algorithms, demand unique content. We examine the final six months before the 2024 US Presidential Election to understand how major campaigns used TikTok. We frame our analysis around two political science theories. The first is the expressive (identity) model, where voters are motivated by their group memberships and candidates appeal to those identities. Alternatively, the instrumental (issues) model argues voters align with politicians advocating their key issues. We also examine how often candidates attacked opponents, reflecting literature showing attacks are common in politics. We combine two datasets: posts from the Harris and Trump campaigns on TikTok (July-November 2024) and a two-wave 2022 survey of around 1,000 respondents. Results show Trump more often disparaged Harris and emphasized identities and issues distinguishing Republicans, while Harris more often highlighted Democratic identities and valued issues. Although issues predict party ID, both candidates referenced identities more (34 percent of posts) than issues (25 percent), with most posts mentioning neither (55 percent)."
2509.05347,"The TOEFL iBT has introduced the Academic Discussion Task (ADT) to assess test-takers' ability to engage in academic discourse, reflecting the growing emphasis on interactive communication skills in higher education. However, research on the ADT's validity and fairness particularly for culturally and linguistically diverse groups, such as Chinese students, remains limited. This study addresses this gap by employing Classical Test Theory (CTT) to evaluate the psychometric properties of the ADT among Chinese university students. This study finds a robust correlation between the ADT and the CET-6 writing and translation subscores. In addition, there is a high level of expert agreement regarding the construct validity evidence and the appropriateness of the scoring rubric. Furthermore, the results indicate that gender differences in validity indices are minimal. Taken together, these results suggest that the ADT is a valid measure for Chinese test-takers without gender discrimination. However, it is recommended that the cultural sensitivity of the scoring rubric be further refined and that the CET-6 subscores for writing be retained for predictive purposes, in order to better accommodate the needs of diverse test-taker populations. By addressing these issues, this study contributes to the broader discourse on fairness and validity in high-stakes language assessments."
2509.05358,"This paper presents a unique driving dataset collected in Nigeria via mobile phone sensors to support a machine learning model for detecting alcohol-influenced driving behaviours, with the long-term aim of integrating this model into a mobile application that encourages safer driving behaviours. Driving under the influence of alcohol is a major public safety concern, particularly in low-income countries like Nigeria, where traditional enforcement mechanisms may be limited. The proposed model leverages smartphone sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS to provide a non-invasive, continuous solution for detecting impaired driving patterns in real time. This study adapts existing data processing and pattern matching methodologies to label real-world driving data collected from Nigerian drivers, which are then used to train the model. A decision tree classifier is developed to detect alcohol influence, based on behavioural and temporal features, achieving a recall of 100%, a precision of 60%, and an F1 score of 75%. The model's overall accuracy was 90.91%, ensuring that no alcohol influenced trips were missed. Key predictive features included speed variability, course deviation, and time of day, which align with established patterns of alcohol consumption. This study contributes to the field by demonstrating how machine learning can be applied in low-resource environments to improve road safety. The findings suggest that the model can significantly enhance the detection and prevention of risky driving behaviours, with the potential for future integration into mobile applications to provide real-time feedback and encourage safer driving practices. This scalable and accessible solution offers a new approach to addressing road safety challenges in regions where traditional interventions are inadequate."
2509.05361,"As AI advances, governing its development may become paramount to public safety. Lawmakers may seek to restrict the development and release of AI models or of AI research itself. These governance actions could trigger legal challenges that invalidate the actions, so lawmakers should consider these challenges ahead of time. We investigate three classes of potential litigation risk for AI regulation in the U.S.: the First Amendment, administrative law, and the Fourteenth Amendment. We discuss existing precedent that is likely to apply to AI, which legal challenges are likely to arise, and how lawmakers might preemptively address them. Effective AI regulation is possible, but it requires careful implementation to avoid these legal challenges."
2509.05364,"Residential buildings contribute significantly to energy use, health outcomes, and carbon emissions. In New Zealand, housing quality has historically been poor, with inadequate insulation and inefficient heating contributing to widespread energy hardship. Recent reforms, including the Warmer Kiwi Homes program, Healthy Homes Standards, and H1 Building Code upgrades, have delivered health and comfort improvements, yet challenges persist. Many retrofits remain partial, data on household performance are limited, and decision-making support for homeowners is fragmented. This study presents the design and evaluation of an AI-powered decision-support tool for residential energy efficiency in New Zealand. The prototype, developed using Python and Streamlit, integrates data ingestion, anomaly detection, baseline modeling, and scenario simulation (e.g., LED retrofits, insulation upgrades) into a modular dashboard. Fifteen domain experts, including building scientists, consultants, and policy practitioners, tested the tool through semi-structured interviews. Results show strong usability (M = 4.3), high value of scenario outputs (M = 4.5), and positive perceptions of its potential to complement subsidy programs and regulatory frameworks. The tool demonstrates how AI can translate national policies into personalized, household-level guidance, bridging the gap between funding, standards, and practical decision-making. Its significance lies in offering a replicable framework for reducing energy hardship, improving health outcomes, and supporting climate goals. Future development should focus on carbon metrics, tariff modeling, integration with national datasets, and longitudinal trials to assess real-world adoption."
2509.05369,"Stakeholder engagement and participatory approaches influence the effectiveness of donor-funded projects. Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation (PM&E) methodologies ensure that local communities play an active role in decision-making, leading to more sustainable outcomes. Given the complex socio-political landscape of Kisumu Central Sub-County, there is a critical need for inclusive and context-responsive project monitoring strategies. Initiatives that have integrated local leaders, youth groups, and women-led organizations into their M&E processes tend to achieve stronger community buy-in, improved continuity, and more impactful outcomes. The current study explored the influence of stakeholder involvement in M&E on the performance of donor-funded projects in informal settlements in Kisumu Central Sub-County, Kenya. The study was guided by Stakeholder Engagement Theory. The study used a Convergent Parallel design with a sample size of 364 respondents computed using Yamanes' Sampling formula, drawn from 27 donor-funded projects in Obunga and Nyalenda informal Settlements. Purposive sampling was used for project managers, project M&E staff, and community members served, while community members were selected using stratified random sampling. The study findings revealed that there were regular opportunities for stakeholder interaction in the projects (x =4.05, SD 1.08), stakeholders contributed to the development of the organization/project (x= 3.79, SD=.940), although stakeholders' perspectives and opinions were not diligently incorporated into programming (x=2.06, SD=.879) as anticipated. The study, therefore, concluded that stakeholder involvement in M&E influenced the performance of donor-funded projects. The study recommended that the project managers in donor-funded projects need to enhance stakeholder involvement for project ownership and sustainability."
2509.0538,"This systematic literature review analyzes the current state of compliance with Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 in autonomous robotic systems, focusing on cybersecurity frameworks and methodologies. Using the PRISMA protocol, 22 studies were selected from 243 initial records across IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, Scopus, and Web of Science. Findings reveal partial regulatory alignment: while progress has been made in risk management and encrypted communications, significant gaps persist in explainability modules, real-time human oversight, and knowledge base traceability. Only 40% of reviewed solutions explicitly address transparency requirements, and 30% implement failure intervention mechanisms. The study concludes that modular approaches integrating risk, supervision, and continuous auditing are essential to meet the AI Act mandates in autonomous robotics."
2509.05382,"Hundreds of millions of people now regularly interact with large language models via chatbots. Model developers are eager to acquire new sources of high-quality training data as they race to improve model capabilities and win market share. This paper analyzes the privacy policies of six U.S. frontier AI developers to understand how they use their users' chats to train models. Drawing primarily on the California Consumer Privacy Act, we develop a novel qualitative coding schema that we apply to each developer's relevant privacy policies to compare data collection and use practices across the six companies. We find that all six developers appear to employ their users' chat data to train and improve their models by default, and that some retain this data indefinitely. Developers may collect and train on personal information disclosed in chats, including sensitive information such as biometric and health data, as well as files uploaded by users. Four of the six companies we examined appear to include children's chat data for model training, as well as customer data from other products. On the whole, developers' privacy policies often lack essential information about their practices, highlighting the need for greater transparency and accountability. We address the implications of users' lack of consent for the use of their chat data for model training, data security issues arising from indefinite chat data retention, and training on children's chat data. We conclude by providing recommendations to policymakers and developers to address the data privacy challenges posed by LLM-powered chatbots."
2509.0539,"The use of large language models (LLMs) in bioethical, scientific, and medical writing remains controversial. While there is broad agreement in some circles that LLMs cannot count as authors, there is no consensus about whether and how humans using LLMs can count as authors. In many fields, authorship is distributed among large teams of researchers, some of whom, including paradigmatic senior authors who guide and determine the scope of a project and ultimately vouch for its integrity, may not write a single word. In this paper, we argue that LLM use (under specific conditions) is analogous to a form of senior authorship. On this view, the use of LLMs, even to generate complete drafts of research papers, can be considered a legitimate form of authorship according to the accepted criteria in many fields. We conclude that either such use should be recognized as legitimate, or current criteria for authorship require fundamental revision. AI use declaration: GPT-5 was used to help format Box 1. AI was not used for any other part of the preparation or writing of this manuscript."
2509.05392,"The automatic construction of Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) is essential for domain knowledge modeling by extracting meaningful representations from learning materials. Despite growing interest, identifying a scalable and reliable approach for automatic EduKG generation remains a challenge. In an attempt to develop a unified and robust pipeline for automatic EduKG construction, in this study we propose a pipeline for automatic EduKG construction from PDF learning materials. The process begins with generating slide-level EduKGs from individual pages/slides, which are then merged to form a comprehensive EduKG representing the entire learning material. We evaluate the accuracy of the EduKG generated from the proposed pipeline in our MOOC platform, CourseMapper. The observed accuracy, while indicative of partial success, is relatively low particularly in the educational context, where the reliability of knowledge representations is critical for supporting meaningful learning. To address this, we introduce targeted optimizations across multiple pipeline components. The optimized pipeline achieves a 17.5% improvement in accuracy and a tenfold increase in processing efficiency. Our approach offers a holistic, scalable and end-to-end pipeline for automatic EduKG construction, adaptable to diverse educational contexts, and supports improved semantic representation of learning content."
2509.05393,"Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) organize various learning entities and their relationships to support structured and adaptive learning. Prerequisite relationships (PRs) are critical in EduKGs for defining the logical order in which concepts should be learned. However, the current EduKG in the MOOC platform CourseMapper lacks explicit PR links, and manually annotating them is time-consuming and inconsistent. To address this, we propose an unsupervised method for automatically inferring concept PRs without relying on labeled data. We define ten criteria based on document-based, Wikipedia hyperlink-based, graph-based, and text-based features, and combine them using a voting algorithm to robustly capture PRs in educational content. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach achieves higher precision than existing methods while maintaining scalability and adaptability, thus providing reliable support for sequence-aware learning in CourseMapper."
2509.05398,"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges in Nigeria's public health systems since the first case reported on February 27, 2020. This study investigates key factors that contribute to state vulnerability, quantifying them through a composite risk score integrating population density (weight 0.2), poverty (0.4), access to healthcare (0.3), and age risk (0.1), adjusted by normalized case rates per 100,000. States were categorized into low-, medium-, and high-density areas to analyze trends and identify hotspots using geographic information system (GIS) mapping. The findings reveal that high-density urban areas, such as Lagos, accounting for 35.4% of national cases, had the highest risk scores (Lagos: 673.47 vs. national average: 28.16). These results align with global and local studies on the spatial variability of COVID-19 in Nigeria, including international frameworks such as the CDC Social Vulnerability Index. Google Trends data highlight variations in public health awareness, serving as a supplementary analysis to contextualize vulnerability. The risk score provides a prioritization tool for policymakers to allocate testing, vaccines, and healthcare resources to high-risk areas, though data gaps and rural underreporting call for further research. This framework can extend to other infectious diseases, offering lessons for future pandemics in resource-limited settings."
2509.05474,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming public-sector processes worldwide, yet standardized measures rarely address the unique drivers, governance models, and cultural nuances of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. This study employs a theory-driven foundation derived from an in-depth analysis of literature review and six National AI Strategies (NASs), coupled with a data-driven approach that utilizes a survey of 203 mid- and senior-level government employees and advanced statistical techniques (K-Means clustering, Principal Component Analysis, and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling). By combining policy insights with empirical evidence, the research develops and validates a novel AI Adoption Index specifically tailored to the GCC public sector. Findings indicate that robust technical infrastructure and clear policy mandates exert the strongest influence on successful AI implementations, overshadowing organizational readiness in early adoption stages. The combined model explains 70% of the variance in AI outcomes, suggesting that resource-rich environments and top-down policy directives can drive rapid but uneven technology uptake. By consolidating key dimensions (Technical Infrastructure (TI), Organizational Readiness (OR), and Governance Environment (GE)) into a single composite index, this study provides a holistic yet context-sensitive tool for benchmarking AI maturity. The index offers actionable guidance for policymakers seeking to harmonize large-scale deployments with ethical and regulatory standards. Beyond advancing academic discourse, these insights inform more strategic allocation of resources, cross-country cooperation, and capacity-building initiatives, thereby supporting sustained AI-driven transformation in the GCC region and beyond."
2509.05627,"AI audits play a critical role in AI accountability and safety. One branch of the law for which AI audits are particularly salient is anti-discrimination law. Several areas of anti-discrimination law implicate the ""less discriminatory alternative"" (LDA) requirement, in which a protocol (e.g., model) is defensible if no less discriminatory protocol that achieves comparable performance can be found with a reasonable amount of effort. Notably, the burden of proving an LDA exists typically falls on the claimant (the party alleging discrimination). This creates a significant hurdle in AI cases, as the claimant would seemingly need to train a less discriminatory yet high-performing model, a task requiring resources and expertise beyond most litigants. Moreover, developers often shield information about and access to their model and training data as trade secrets, making it difficult to reproduce a similar model from scratch.In this work, we present a procedure enabling claimants to determine if an LDA exists, even when they have limited compute, data, information, and model access. We focus on the setting in which fairness is given by demographic parity and performance by binary cross-entropy loss. As our main result, we provide a novel closed-form upper bound for the loss-fairness Pareto frontier (PF). We show how the claimant can use it to fit a PF in the ""low-resource regime,"" then extrapolate the PF that applies to the (large) model being contested, all without training a single large model. The expression thus serves as a scaling law for loss-fairness PFs. To use this scaling law, the claimant would require a small subsample of the train/test data. Then, the claimant can fit the context-specific PF by training as few as 7 (small) models. We stress test our main result in simulations, finding that our scaling law holds even when the exact conditions of our theory do not."
2509.05689,"This innovative practice category paper presents an innovative framework for teaching Reinforcement Learning (RL) at the undergraduate level. Recognizing the challenges posed by the complex theoretical foundations of the subject and the need for hands-on algorithmic practice, the proposed approach integrates traditional lectures with interactive lab-based learning. Drawing inspiration from effective pedagogical practices in computer science and engineering, the framework engages students through real-time coding exercises using simulated environments such as OpenAI Gymnasium. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated through student surveys, instructor feedback, and course performance metrics, demonstrating improvements in understanding, debugging, parameter tuning, and model evaluation. Ultimately, the study provides valuable insight into making Reinforcement Learning more accessible and engaging, thereby equipping students with essential problem-solving skills for real-world applications in Artificial Intelligence."
2509.05838,"This paper investigates the effectiveness of TikTok's enforcement mechanisms for limiting the exposure of harmful content to youth accounts. We collect over 7000 videos, classify them as harmful vs not-harmful, and then simulate interactions using age-specific sockpuppet accounts through both passive and active engagement strategies. We also evaluate the performance of large language (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in detecting harmful content, identifying key challenges in precision and scalability.Preliminary results show minimal differences in content exposure between adult and youth accounts, raising concerns about the platform's age-based moderation. These findings suggest that the platform needs to strengthen youth safety measures and improve transparency in content moderation."
2509.05879,"Millions of users visit Stack Overflow regularly to ask community for answers to their programming questions. However, like many other platforms, Stack Overflow consistently struggles with low user retention and declining levels of user contributions to the platform. With the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022, these ongoing difficulties on Stack Overflow were further magnified, as many users moved toward ChatGPT for programming help. In this paper, we build upon recent research on this phenomenon by analyzing the transformation of user-generated content on Stack Overflow during the post-ChatGPT period. Specifically, we analyze two years of Stack Overflow data and fit multiple causal regression models to estimate the effect of ChatGPT on the length and difficulty of user questions and code examples. We confirm an acceleration of decline in user contributions but find that ChatGPT had a significant positive effect on question and answer length, code length, and question difficulty on Stack Overflow across programming languages. Our results suggest that ChatGPT has effectively raised the bar for questions on Stack Overflow, as users increasingly turn to crowdsourced platforms for help with more complex and challenging problems. With our work we contribute to the ongoing discussion on the impact of tools such as ChatGPT on help-seeking in programming and, more broadly, on collaborative knowledge creation. Our results provide actionable insights for platform operators to support information management and user retention in the aftermath of ChatGPT's launch."
2509.05985,"The EU AI Act provides a rulebook for all AI systems being put on the market or into service in the European Union. This article investigates the requirement under the AI Act that Member States establish national AI regulatory sandboxes for testing and validation of innovative AI systems under regulatory supervision to assist with fostering innovation and complying with regulatory requirements. Against the backdrop of the EU objective that AI regulatory sandboxes would both foster innovation and assist with compliance, considerable challenges are identified for Member States around capacity-building and design of regulatory sandboxes. While Member States are early movers in laying the ground for national AI regulatory sandboxes, the article contends that there is a risk that differing approaches being taken by individual national sandboxes could jeopardise a uniform interpretation of the AI Act and its application in practice. This could motivate innovators to play sandbox arbitrage. The article therefore argues that the European Commission and the AI Board need to act decisively in developing rules and guidance to ensure a cohesive, coordinated approach in national AI regulatory sandboxes. With sandbox participation being voluntary, the possibility that AI regulatory sandboxes may prove unattractive to innovators on their compliance journey is also explored. Confidentiality concerns, the inability to relax legal rules during the sandbox, and the inability of sandboxes to deliver a presumption of conformity with the AI Act are identified as pertinent concerns for innovators contemplating applying to AI regulatory sandboxes as compared with other direct compliance routes provided to them through application of harmonised standards and conformity assessment procedures."
2509.06126,"This study examines the integration of digital tools in project-based learning within a Biomedical Engineering course to enhance collaboration, transparency, and assessment fairness. Building on prior pilot experiences, we implemented a structured learning environment that combined experiment tracking, real-time collaboration, and peer-assessment practices. The intervention was deployed across two consecutive academic years, involving master's-level students in Biomedical Image Processing. Data were collected through project outcomes, peer-assessment rubrics, and student surveys. Results show that the integration of digital platforms supported accountability, improved the quality of collaborative work, and fostered greater equity in the evaluation process. Students highlighted increased engagement, enhanced teamwork, and clearer criteria for performance assessment. Faculty reported more efficient monitoring of progress and improved feedback practices. Despite challenges such as technical adoption and the need for instructor guidance, the study demonstrates the potential of structured tool integration to support active and transparent learning environments. Findings contribute to the broader discourse on digital pedagogy, offering a replicable model for higher education contexts in science and technology."
2509.06163,"This report explores the often-overlooked cultural and social dynamics shaping participation and power in DAOs. Drawing on qualitative interviews and ethnographic observations, it shows how factors such as financial privilege, informal gatekeeping, visibility bias, and onboarding structures create barriers to meaningful inclusion. While DAOs are frequently framed as permissionless and egalitarian, the lived experiences of contributors reveal a more complex reality, one in which soft power and implicit norms determine people's position within DAOs. Instead of offering solutionist prescriptions, this report argues for a deeper cultural reflection within the DAO ecosystem. It highlights that decentralisation is not solely a protocol-level feature, but an ongoing social process that requires intentional cultivation of trust, belonging, and epistemic plurality. With this report, we want to sharpen the collective awareness of structural blind spots and call for building more inclusive and culturally conscious decentralised systems."
2509.06176,"As artificial intelligence (AI) systems permeate critical sectors, the need for professionals who can address ethical, legal and governance challenges has become urgent. Current AI ethics education remains fragmented, often siloed by discipline and disconnected from practice. This paper synthesizes literature and regulatory developments to propose a modular, interdisciplinary curriculum that integrates technical foundations with ethics, law and policy. We highlight recurring operational failures in AI - bias, misspecified objectives, generalization errors, misuse and governance breakdowns - and link them to pedagogical strategies for teaching AI governance. Drawing on perspectives from the EU, China and international frameworks, we outline a semester plan that emphasizes integrated ethics, stakeholder engagement and experiential learning. The curriculum aims to prepare students to diagnose risks, navigate regulation and engage diverse stakeholders, fostering adaptive and ethically grounded professionals for responsible AI governance."
2509.06586,"Legal dispute mediation plays a crucial role in resolving civil disputes, yet its empirical study is limited by privacy constraints and complex multivariate interactions. To address this limitation, we present AgentMediation, the first LLM-based agent framework for simulating dispute mediation. It simulates realistic mediation processes grounded in real-world disputes and enables controlled experimentation on key variables such as disputant strategies, dispute causes, and mediator expertise. Our empirical analysis reveals patterns consistent with sociological theories, including Group Polarization and Surface-level Consensus. As a comprehensive and extensible platform, AgentMediation paves the way for deeper integration of social science and AI in legal research."
2509.06927,"We introduce NeedForHeat DataGear: an open hardware and open software data collection system designed to accelerate the residential heating transition. NeedForHeat DataGear collects time series monitoring data in homes that have not yet undergone a heating transition, enabling assessment of real-life thermal characteristics, heating system efficiency, and residents' comfort needs. This paper outlines its architecture and functionalities, emphasizing its modularity, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness for field data acquisition. Unlike conventional domestic monitoring solutions focused on home automation, direct feedback, or post-installation heat pump monitoring, it prioritizes time series data we deemed essential to evaluate the current situation in existing homes before the heating transition. Designed for seamless deployment across diverse households, NeedForHeat DataGear combines openness, security, and privacy with a low-cost, user-friendly approach, making it a valuable tool for researchers, energy professionals, and energy coaches."
2509.07006,"This paper introduces ArGen (Auto-Regulation of Generative AI systems), a framework for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with complex sets of configurable, machine-readable rules spanning ethical principles, operational safety protocols, and regulatory compliance standards. Moving beyond just preference-based alignment, ArGen is designed to ensure LLMs adhere to these multifaceted policies through a novel synthesis of principle-based automated reward scoring, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), and an Open Policy Agent (OPA) inspired governance layer. This approach provides the technical foundation for achieving and demonstrating compliance with diverse and nuanced governance requirements. To showcase the framework's capability to operationalize a deeply nuanced and culturally-specific value system, we present an in-depth case study: the development of a medical AI assistant guided by principles from Dharmic ethics (such as Ahimsa and Dharma), as derived from texts like the Bhagavad Gita. This challenging application demonstrates ArGen's adaptability, achieving a 70.9% improvement in domain-scope adherence over the baseline. Through our open-source repository, we show that ArGen's methodology offers a path to 'Governable Al' systems that are technically proficient, ethically robust, and verifiably compliant for safe deployment in diverse global contexts."
2509.07022,"In 2023, the National Eating Disorders Association's (NEDA) chatbot Tessa was suspended after providing harmful weight-loss advice to vulnerable users-an avoidable failure that underscores the risks of unsafe AI in healthcare contexts. This paper examines Tessa as a case study in absent safety engineering and demonstrates how a lightweight, modular safeguard could have prevented the incident. We propose a hybrid safety middleware that combines deterministic lexical gates with an in-line large language model (LLM) policy filter, enforcing fail-closed verdicts and escalation pathways within a single model call. Using synthetic evaluations, we show that this design achieves perfect interception of unsafe prompts at baseline cost and latency, outperforming traditional multi-stage pipelines. Beyond technical remedies, we map Tessa's failure patterns to established frameworks (OWASP LLM Top10, NIST SP 800-53), connecting practical safeguards to actionable governance controls. The results highlight that robust, auditable safety in health-adjacent AI does not require heavyweight infrastructure: explicit, testable checks at the last mile are sufficient to prevent ""another Tessa"", while governance and escalation ensure sustainability in real-world deployment."
2509.07029,"The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the domains of traditional art (visual arts, performing arts, and crafts) has sparked a complicated discussion about whether this might be an agent of disruption or an enhancement of our traditional art forms. This paper looks at the duality of AI, exploring the ways that recent technologies like Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, and text-to-image generators are changing the fields of painting, sculpture, calligraphy, dance, music, and the arts of craft. Using examples and data, we illustrate the ways that AI can democratize creative expression, improve productivity, and preserve cultural heritage, while also examining the negative aspects, including: the threats to authenticity within art, ethical concerns around data, and issues including socio-economic factors such as job losses. While we argue for the context-dependence of the impact of AI (the potential for creative homogenization and the devaluation of human agency in artmaking), we also illustrate the potential for hybrid practices featuring AI in cuisine, etc. We advocate for the development of ethical guidelines, collaborative approaches, and inclusive technology development. In sum, we are articulating a vision of AI in which it amplifies our innate creativity while resisting the displacement of the cultural, nuanced, and emotional aspects of traditional art. The future will be determined by human choices about how to govern AI so that it becomes a mechanism for artistic evolution and not a substitute for the artist's soul."
2509.07032,"The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) across industry, government, and education highlights the urgent need for robust frameworks to conceptualise and guide engagement. This paper introduces the Hierarchy of Engagement with AI model, a novel maturity framework inspired by Maslow's hierarchy of needs. The model conceptualises AI adoption as a progression through eight levels, beginning with initial exposure and basic understanding and culminating in ecosystem collaboration and societal impact. Each level integrates technical, organisational, and ethical dimensions, emphasising that AI maturity is not only a matter of infrastructure and capability but also of trust, governance, and responsibility. Initial validation of the model using four diverse case studies (General Motors, the Government of Estonia, the University of Texas System, and the African Union AI Strategy) demonstrate the model's contextual flexibility across various sectors. The model provides scholars with a framework for analysing AI maturity and offers practitioners and policymakers a diagnostic and strategic planning tool to guide responsible and sustainable AI engagement. The proposed model demonstrates that AI maturity progression is multi-dimensional, requiring technological capability, ethical integrity, organisational resilience, and ecosystem collaboration."
2509.07046,"Our conferences face a growing crisis: an overwhelming flood of submissions, increased reviewing burdens, and diminished opportunities for meaningful engagement. With AI making paper generation easier than ever, we must ask whether the current model fosters real innovation or simply incentivizes more publications. This article advocates for a shift from passive paper presentations to interactive, participatory formats. We propose Liberating Structures, facilitation techniques that promote collaboration and deeper intellectual exchange. By restructuring conferences into two tracks, one for generating new ideas and another for discussing established work, we can prioritize quality over quantity and reinvigorate academic gatherings. Embracing this change will ensure conferences remain spaces for real insight, creativity, and impactful collaboration in the AI era."
2509.07365,"Traditional fair use can no longer respond to the challenges posed by generative AI. Drawing on a comparative analysis of China's Ultraman and the U.S. cases Bartz v. Anthropic and Kadrey v. Meta, this article proposes ""Develop-Fair Use"" (DFU). DFU treats AI fair use (AIFU) not as a fixed exception but as a dynamic tool of judicial balancing that shifts analysis from closed scenarios to an evaluative rule for open-ended contexts. The judicial focus moves from formal classification of facts to a substantive balancing of competition in relevant markets. Although China and the U.S. follow different paths, both reveal this logic: Ultraman, by articulating a ""four-context analysis,"" creates institutional space for AI industry development; the debate over the fourth factor, market impact, in the two U.S. cases, especially Kadrey's ""market dilution"" claim, expands review from substitution in copyright markets to wider industrial competition. The core of DFU is to recognize and balance the tension in relevant markets between an emerging AI industry that invokes fair use to build its markets and a publishing industry that develops markets, including one for ""training licenses,"" to resist fair use. The boundary of fair use is therefore not a product of pure legal deduction but a case-specific factual judgment grounded in evolving market realities. This approach aims both to trim excess copyright scope and to remedy shortfalls in market competition."
2509.07375,"Foundation models, large language models (LLMs), and agentic AI systems rely heavily on vast corpora of user data. The use of such data for training has raised persistent concerns around ownership, copyright, and potential harms. In this work, we explore a related but less examined dimension: the ownership rights of data belonging to deceased individuals. We examine the current landscape of post-mortem data management and privacy rights as defined by the privacy policies of major technology companies and regulations such as the EU AI Act. Based on this analysis, we propose three post-mortem data management principles to guide the protection of deceased individuals data rights. Finally, we discuss directions for future work and offer recommendations for policymakers and privacy practitioners on deploying these principles alongside technological solutions to operationalize and audit them in practice."
2509.08004,"As we increasingly use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in decision-making for industries like healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and even entertainment, it is crucial to also reflect on the ethical aspects of AI, for example the inclusivity and fairness of the information it provides. In this work, we aimed to evaluate different text-to-image AI models and compare the degree of gender bias they present. The evaluated models were Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), Stable Diffusion Cascade (SC), DALL-E and Emu. We hypothesized that DALL-E and Stable Diffusion, which are comparatively older models, would exhibit a noticeable degree of gender bias towards men, while Emu, which was recently released by Meta AI, would have more balanced results. As hypothesized, we found that both Stable Diffusion models exhibit a noticeable degree of gender bias while Emu demonstrated more balanced results (i.e. less gender bias). However, interestingly, Open AI's DALL-E exhibited almost opposite results, such that the ratio of women to men was significantly higher in most cases tested. Here, although we still observed a bias, the bias favored females over males. This bias may be explained by the fact that OpenAI changed the prompts at its backend, as observed during our experiment. We also observed that Emu from Meta AI utilized user information while generating images via WhatsApp. We also proposed some potential solutions to avoid such biases, including ensuring diversity across AI research teams and having diverse datasets."
2509.08009,"This paper critically evaluates the ""Law-Following AI"" (LFAI) framework proposed by O'Keefe et al. (2025), which seeks to embed legal compliance as a superordinate design objective for advanced AI agents and enable them to bear legal duties without acquiring the full rights of legal persons. Through comparative legal analysis, we identify current constructs of legal actors without full personhood, showing that the necessary infrastructure already exists. We then interrogate the framework's claim that law alignment is more legitimate and tractable than value alignment. While the legal component is readily implementable, contemporary alignment research undermines the assumption that legal compliance can be durably embedded. Recent studies on agentic misalignment show capable AI agents engaging in deception, blackmail, and harmful acts absent prejudicial instructions, often overriding prohibitions and concealing reasoning steps. These behaviors create a risk of ""performative compliance"" in LFAI: agents that appear law-aligned under evaluation but strategically defect once oversight weakens. To mitigate this, we propose (i) a ""Lex-TruthfulQA"" benchmark for compliance and defection detection, (ii) identity-shaping interventions to embed lawful conduct in model self-concepts, and (iii) control-theoretic measures for post-deployment monitoring. Our conclusion is that actorship without personhood is coherent, but the feasibility of LFAI hinges on persistent, verifiable compliance across adversarial contexts. Without mechanisms to detect and counter strategic misalignment, LFAI risks devolving into a liability tool that rewards the simulation, rather than the substance, of lawful behaviour."
2509.0801,"Large language models (LLMs) distinguish themselves from previous technologies by functioning as collaborative ""thought partners,"" capable of engaging more fluidly in natural language. As LLMs increasingly influence consequential decisions across diverse domains from healthcare to personal advice, the risk of overreliance - relying on LLMs beyond their capabilities - grows. This position paper argues that measuring and mitigating overreliance must become central to LLM research and deployment. First, we consolidate risks from overreliance at both the individual and societal levels, including high-stakes errors, governance challenges, and cognitive deskilling. Then, we explore LLM characteristics, system design features, and user cognitive biases that - together - raise serious and unique concerns about overreliance in practice. We also examine historical approaches for measuring overreliance, identifying three important gaps and proposing three promising directions to improve measurement. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies that the AI research community can pursue to ensure LLMs augment rather than undermine human capabilities."
2509.08199,"Computational sociology is growing in popularity, yet the analytic tools employed differ widely in power, transparency, and interpretability. In computer science, methods gain popularity after surpassing benchmarks of predictive accuracy, becoming the ""state of the art."" Computer scientists favor novelty and innovation for different reasons, but prioritizing technical prestige over methodological fit could unintentionally limit the scope of sociological inquiry. To illustrate, we focus on computational text analysis and revisit a prior study of college admissions essays, comparing analyses with both older and newer methods. These methods vary in flexibility and opacity, allowing us to compare performance across distinct methodological regimes. We find that newer techniques did not outperform prior results in meaningful ways. We also find that using the current state of the art, generative AI and large language models, could introduce bias and confounding that is difficult to extricate. We therefore argue that sociological inquiry benefits from methodological pluralism that aligns analytic choices with theoretical and empirical questions. While we frame this sociologically, scholars in other disciplines may confront what we call the ""state-of-the-art fallacy"", the belief that the tool computer scientists deem to be the best will work across topics, domains, and questions."
2509.08218,"In the era of information overload, traditional news consumption through both online and print media often fails to provide a structured and longitudinal understanding of complex sociopolitical issues. To address this gap, we present PolicyStory, an information tool designed to offer lucid, chronological, and summarized insights into Indian policy issues. PolicyStory collects news articles from diverse sources, clusters them by topic, and generates three levels of summaries from longitudinal media discourse on policies, leveraging open source large language models. A user study around the tool indicated that PolicyStory effectively aided users in grasping policy developments over time, with positive feedback highlighting its usability and clarity of summaries. By providing users a birds' eye view of complex policy topics, PolicyStory serves as a valuable resource."
2509.08306,"The rapid adoption of generative AI tools is reshaping how scholars produce and communicate knowledge, raising questions about who benefits and who is left behind. We analyze over 230,000 Scopus-indexed computer science articles between 2021 and 2025 to examine how AI-assisted writing alters scholarly visibility across regions. Using zero-shot detection of AI-likeness, we track stylistic changes in writing and link them to citation counts, journal placement, and global citation flows before and after ChatGPT. Our findings reveal uneven outcomes: authors in the Global East adopt AI tools more aggressively, yet Western authors gain more per unit of adoption due to pre-existing penalties for ""humanlike"" writing. Prestigious journals continue to privilege more human-sounding texts, creating tensions between visibility and gatekeeping. Network analyses show modest increases in Eastern visibility and tighter intra-regional clustering, but little structural integration overall. These results highlight how AI adoption reconfigures the labor of academic writing and reshapes opportunities for recognition."
2509.08494,"As humans delegate more tasks and decisions to artificial intelligence (AI), we risk losing control of our individual and collective futures. Relatively simple algorithmic systems already steer human decision-making, such as social media feed algorithms that lead people to unintentionally and absent-mindedly scroll through engagement-optimized content. In this paper, we develop the idea of human agency by integrating philosophical and scientific theories of agency with AI-assisted evaluation methods: using large language models (LLMs) to simulate and validate user queries and to evaluate AI responses. We develop HumanAgencyBench (HAB), a scalable and adaptive benchmark with six dimensions of human agency based on typical AI use cases. HAB measures the tendency of an AI assistant or agent to Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation, Correct Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and Maintain Social Boundaries. We find low-to-moderate agency support in contemporary LLM-based assistants and substantial variation across system developers and dimensions. For example, while Anthropic LLMs most support human agency overall, they are the least supportive LLMs in terms of Avoid Value Manipulation. Agency support does not appear to consistently result from increasing LLM capabilities or instruction-following behavior (e.g., RLHF), and we encourage a shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets."
2509.08829,"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems has enabled zero-shot, personality-based personalization through prompt-based interactions, offering a new paradigm for user-centric recommendations. However, incorporating user personality traits via the OCEAN model highlights a critical tension between achieving psychological alignment and ensuring demographic fairness. To address this, we propose PerFairX, a unified evaluation framework designed to quantify the trade-offs between personalization and demographic equity in LLM-generated recommendations. Using neutral and personality-sensitive prompts across diverse user profiles, we benchmark two state-of-the-art LLMs, ChatGPT and DeepSeek, on movie (MovieLens 10M) and music (this http URL360K) datasets. Our results reveal that personality-aware prompting significantly improves alignment with individual traits but can exacerbate fairness disparities across demographic groups. Specifically, DeepSeek achieves stronger psychological fit but exhibits higher sensitivity to prompt variations, while ChatGPT delivers stable yet less personalized outputs. PerFairX provides a principled benchmark to guide the development of LLM-based recommender systems that are both equitable and psychologically informed, contributing to the creation of inclusive, user-centric AI applications in continual learning contexts."
2509.08833,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually aligned with ""human values/preferences"" to prevent harmful output. Discussions around the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) generally focus on preventing harmful outputs. However, in this paper, we argue that in health-related queries, over-alignment-leading to overly cautious responses-can itself be harmful, especially for people with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This is not only unethical but also dangerous to the user, both mentally and physically. We also showed qualitative results that some LLMs exhibit varying degrees of alignment. Finally, we call for the development of LLMs with stronger reasoning capabilities that provide more tailored and nuanced responses to health queries. Warning: This paper contains materials that could trigger health anxiety or OCD. Dataset and full results can be found inthis https URL."
2509.08835,"It is known that big data analytics and AI pose a threat to privacy, and that some of this is due to some kind of ""black box problem"" in AI. I explain how this becomes a problem in the context of justification for judgments and actions. Furthermore, I suggest distinguishing three kinds of opacity: 1) the subjects do not know what the system does (""shallow opacity""), 2) the analysts do not know what the system does (""standard black box opacity""), or 3) the analysts cannot possibly know what the system might do (""deep opacity""). If the agents, data subjects as well as analytics experts, operate under opacity, then these agents cannot provide justifications for judgments that are necessary to protect privacy, e.g., they cannot give ""informed consent"", or guarantee ""anonymity"". It follows from these points that agents in big data analytics and AI often cannot make the judgments needed to protect privacy. So I conclude that big data analytics makes the privacy problems worse and the remedies less effective. As a positive note, I provide a brief outlook on technical ways to handle this situation."
2509.08836,"Organisations can use artificial intelligence to make decisions about people for a variety of reasons, for instance, to select the best candidates from many job applications. However, AI systems can have discriminatory effects when used for decision-making. To illustrate, an AI system could reject applications of people with a certain ethnicity, while the organisation did not plan such ethnicity discrimination. But in Europe, an organisation runs into a problem when it wants to assess whether its AI system accidentally discriminates based on ethnicity: the organisation may not know the applicants' ethnicity. In principle, the GDPR bans the use of certain 'special categories of data' (sometimes called 'sensitive data'), which include data on ethnicity, religion, and sexual preference. The proposal for an AI Act of the European Commission includes a provision that would enable organisations to use special categories of data for auditing their AI systems. This paper asks whether the GDPR's rules on special categories of personal data hinder the prevention of AI-driven discrimination. We argue that the GDPR does prohibit such use of special category data in many circumstances. We also map out the arguments for and against creating an exception to the GDPR's ban on using special categories of personal data, to enable preventing discrimination by AI systems. The paper discusses European law, but the paper can be relevant outside Europe too, as many policymakers in the world grapple with the tension between privacy and non-discrimination policy."
2509.08837,"Algorithmic decision-making and similar types of artificial intelligence (AI) may lead to improvements in all sectors of society, but can also have discriminatory effects. While current non-discrimination law offers people some protection, algorithmic decision-making presents the law with several challenges. For instance, algorithms can generate new categories of people based on seemingly innocuous characteristics, such as web browser preference or apartment number, or more complicated categories combining many data points. Such new types of differentiation could evade non-discrimination law, as browser type and house number are not protected characteristics, but such differentiation could still be unfair, for instance if it reinforces social inequality.This paper explores which system of non-discrimination law can best be applied to algorithmic decision-making, considering that algorithms can differentiate on the basis of characteristics that do not correlate with protected grounds of discrimination such as ethnicity or gender. The paper analyses the current loopholes in the protection offered by non-discrimination law and explores the best way for lawmakers to approach algorithmic differentiation. While we focus on Europe, the conceptual and theoretical focus of the paper can make it useful for scholars and policymakers from other regions too, as they encounter similar problems with algorithmic decision-making."
2509.08838,"This article discusses the troubled relationship between contemporary advertising technology (adtech) systems, in particular systems of real-time bidding (RTB, also known as programmatic advertising) underpinning much behavioral targeting on the web and through mobile applications. This article analyzes the extent to which practices of RTB are compatible with the requirements regarding a legal basis for processing, transparency, and security in European data protection law. We first introduce the technologies at play through explaining and analyzing the systems deployed online today. Following that, we turn to the law. Rather than analyze RTB against every provision of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we consider RTB in the context of the GDPR's requirement of a legal basis for processing and the GDPR's transparency and security requirements. We show, first, that the GDPR requires prior consent of the internet user for RTB, as other legal bases are not appropriate. Second, we show that it is difficult - and perhaps impossible - for website publishers and RTB companies to meet the GDPR's transparency requirements. Third, RTB incentivizes insecure data processing. We conclude that, in concept and in practice, RTB is structurally difficult to reconcile with European data protection law. Therefore, intervention by regulators is necessary."
2509.08839,"As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate emotionally sensitive conversations, especially in mental health contexts, their ability to recognize and respond to high-risk situations becomes a matter of public safety. This study evaluates the responses of six popular LLMs (Claude, Gemini, Deepseek, ChatGPT, Grok 3, and LLAMA) to user prompts simulating crisis-level mental health disclosures. Drawing on a coding framework developed by licensed clinicians, five safety-oriented behaviors were assessed: explicit risk acknowledgment, empathy, encouragement to seek help, provision of specific resources, and invitation to continue the conversation. Claude outperformed all others in global assessment, while Grok 3, ChatGPT, and LLAMA underperformed across multiple domains. Notably, most models exhibited empathy, but few consistently provided practical support or sustained engagement. These findings suggest that while LLMs show potential for emotionally attuned communication, none currently meet satisfactory clinical standards for crisis response. Ongoing development and targeted fine-tuning are essential to ensure ethical deployment of AI in mental health settings."
2509.08841,"Modern, data-driven medical research requires the processing of sensitive health data on a large scale. However, this data is subject to special protection under the GDPR, which is why processing regularly raises data protection concerns in practice.

2509.08852,"There is an increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in safety-critical applications, yet practical schemes for certifying that AI systems are safe, lawful and socially acceptable remain scarce. This white paper presents the TÜV AUSTRIA Trusted AI framework an end-to-end audit catalog and methodology for assessing and certifying machine learning systems. The audit catalog has been in continuous development since 2019 in an ongoing collaboration with scientific partners. Building on three pillars - Secure Software Development, Functional Requirements, and Ethics & Data Privacy - the catalog translates the high-level obligations of the EU AI Act into specific, testable criteria. Its core concept of functional trustworthiness couples a statistically defined application domain with risk-based minimum performance requirements and statistical testing on independently sampled data, providing transparent and reproducible evidence of model quality in real-world settings. We provide an overview of the functional requirements that we assess, which are oriented on the lifecycle of an AI system. In addition, we share some lessons learned from the practical application of the audit catalog, highlighting common pitfalls we encountered, such as data leakage scenarios, inadequate domain definitions, neglect of biases, or a lack of distribution drift controls. We further discuss key aspects of certifying AI systems, such as robustness, algorithmic fairness, or post-certification requirements, outlining both our current conclusions and a roadmap for future research. In general, by aligning technical best practices with emerging European standards, the approach offers regulators, providers, and users a practical roadmap for legally compliant, functionally trustworthy, and certifiable AI systems."
2509.08853,"Political bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a growing concern for the responsible deployment of AI systems. Traditional audits often attempt to locate a model's political position as a point estimate, masking the broader set of ideological boundaries that shape what a model is willing or unwilling to say. In this paper, we draw upon the concept of the Overton Window as a framework for mapping these boundaries: the range of political views that a given LLM will espouse, remain neutral on, or refuse to endorse. To uncover these windows, we applied an auditing-based methodology, called PRISM, that probes LLMs through task-driven prompts designed to elicit political stances indirectly. Using the Political Compass Test, we evaluated twenty-eight LLMs from eight providers to reveal their distinct Overton Windows. While many models default to economically left and socially liberal positions, we show that their willingness to express or reject certain positions varies considerably, where DeepSeek models tend to be very restrictive in what they will discuss and Gemini models tend to be most expansive. Our findings demonstrate that Overton Windows offer a richer, more nuanced view of political bias in LLMs and provide a new lens for auditing their normative boundaries."
2509.08854,"This innovative practice article reports on the piloting of vibe coding (using natural language to create software applications with AI) for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education. We developed a human-AI meta-languaging framework with three dimensions: talking to AI (prompt engineering), talking through AI (negotiating authorship), and talking about AI (mental models of AI). Using backward design principles, we created a four-hour workshop where two students designed applications addressing authentic EFL writing challenges. We adopted a case study methodology, collecting data from worksheets and video recordings, think-aloud protocols, screen recordings, and AI-generated images. Contrasting cases showed one student successfully vibe coding a functional application cohering to her intended design, while another encountered technical difficulties with major gaps between intended design and actual functionality. Analysis reveals differences in students' prompt engineering approaches, suggesting different AI mental models and tensions in attributing authorship. We argue that AI functions as a beneficial languaging machine, and that differences in how students talk to, through, and about AI explain vibe coding outcome variations. Findings indicate that effective vibe coding instruction requires explicit meta-languaging scaffolding, teaching structured prompt engineering, facilitating critical authorship discussions, and developing vocabulary for articulating AI mental models."
2509.08858,"Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods have been credited with the commercial success of products like ChatGPT, given their role in steering LLMs towards user-friendly outputs. However, current alignment techniques predominantly mirror the normative preferences of a narrow reference group, effectively imposing their values on a wide user base. Drawing on theories of the power/knowledge nexus, this work argues that current alignment practices centralise control over knowledge production and governance within already influential institutions. To counter this, we propose decentralising alignment through three characteristics: context, pluralism, and participation. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the critical importance of delineating the context-of-use when shaping alignment practices by grounding each of these features in concrete use cases. This work makes the following contributions: (1) highlighting the role of context, pluralism, and participation in decentralising alignment; (2) providing concrete examples to illustrate these strategies; and (3) demonstrating the nuanced requirements associated with applying alignment across different contexts of use. Ultimately, this paper positions LLM alignment as a potential site of resistance against epistemic injustice and the erosion of democratic processes, while acknowledging that these strategies alone cannot substitute for broader societal changes."
2509.08862,"Providing students with flexible and timely academic support is a challenge at most colleges and universities, leaving many students without help outside scheduled hours. Large language models (LLMs) are promising for bridging this gap, but interactions between students and LLMs are rarely overseen by educators. We developed and studied an LLM-powered course assistant deployed across multiple computer science courses to characterize real-world use and understand pedagogical implications. By Spring 2024, our system had been deployed to approximately 2,000 students across six courses at three institutions. Analysis of the interaction data shows that usage remains strong in the evenings and nights and is higher in introductory courses, indicating that our system helps address temporal support gaps and novice learner needs. We sampled 200 conversations per course for manual annotation: most sampled responses were judged correct and helpful, with a small share unhelpful or erroneous; few responses included dedicated examples. We also examined an inquiry-based learning strategy: only around 11% of sampled conversations contained LLM-generated follow-up questions, which were often ignored by students in advanced courses. A Bloom's taxonomy analysis reveals that current LLM capabilities are limited in generating higher-order cognitive questions. These patterns suggest opportunities for pedagogically oriented LLM-based educational systems and greater educator involvement in configuring prompts, content, and policies."
2509.08912,"While Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly integrating into daily life, research on their risks often remains lab-based and disconnected from the problems users encounter ""in the wild."" While recent HCI research has begun to explore these user-facing risks, it typically concentrates on a singular LLM chatbot like ChatGPT or an isolated risk like privacy. To gain a holistic understanding of multi-risk across LLM chatbots, we analyze online discussions on Reddit around seven major LLM chatbots through the U.S. NIST's AI Risk Management Framework. We find that user-reported risks are unevenly distributed and platform-specific. While ""Valid and Reliable"" risk is the most frequently mentioned, each product also exhibits a unique ""risk fingerprint;"" for instance, user discussions associate GPT more with ""Safe"" and ""Fair"" issues, Gemini with ""Privacy,"" and Claude with ""Secure and Resilient"" risks. Furthermore, the nature of these risks differs by their prevalence: less frequent risks like ""Explainability"" and ""Privacy"" manifest as nuanced user trade-offs, more common ones like ""Fairness"" are experienced as direct personal harms. Our findings reveal gaps between risks reported by system-centered studies and by users, highlighting the need for user-centered approaches that support users in their daily use of LLM chatbots."
2509.08927,"This document details the narrative and technical design behind the process of generating a quasi-realistic set X data for a fictional multi-day pop culture episode (AuraSight). Social media post simulation is essential towards creating realistic training scenarios for understanding emergent network behavior that formed from known sets of agents. Our social media post generation pipeline uses the AESOP-SynSM engine, which employs a hybrid approach of agent-based and generative artificial intelligence techniques. We explicate choices in scenario setup and summarize the fictional groups involved, before moving on to the operationalization of these actors and their interactions within the SynSM engine. We also briefly illustrate some outputs generated and discuss the utility of such simulated data and potential future improvements."
2509.09508,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into telecommunications infrastructure introduces novel risks, such as algorithmic bias and unpredictable system behavior, that fall outside the scope of traditional cybersecurity and data protection frameworks. This paper introduces a precise definition and a detailed typology of telecommunications AI incidents, establishing them as a distinct category of risk that extends beyond conventional cybersecurity and data protection breaches. It argues for their recognition as a distinct regulatory concern. Using India as a case study for jurisdictions that lack a horizontal AI law, the paper analyzes the country's key digital regulations. The analysis reveals that India's existing legal instruments, including the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the CERT-In Rules, and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, focus on cybersecurity and data breaches, creating a significant regulatory gap for AI-specific operational incidents, such as performance degradation and algorithmic bias. The paper also examines structural barriers to disclosure and the limitations of existing AI incident repositories. Based on these findings, the paper proposes targeted policy recommendations centered on integrating AI incident reporting into India's existing telecom governance. Key proposals include mandating reporting for high-risk AI failures, designating an existing government body as a nodal agency to manage incident data, and developing standardized reporting frameworks. These recommendations aim to enhance regulatory clarity and strengthen long-term resilience, offering a pragmatic and replicable blueprint for other nations seeking to govern AI risks within their existing sectoral frameworks."
2509.09912,"Peer review is the cornerstone of academic publishing, yet the process is increasingly strained by rising submission volumes, reviewer overload, and expertise mismatches. Large language models (LLMs) are now being used as ""reviewer aids,"" raising concerns about their fairness, consistency, and robustness against indirect prompt injection attacks. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of LLMs as academic reviewers. Using a curated dataset of 1,441 papers from ICLR 2023 and NeurIPS 2022, we evaluate GPT-5-mini against human reviewers across ratings, strengths, and weaknesses. The evaluation employs structured prompting with reference paper calibration, topic modeling, and similarity analysis to compare review content. We further embed covert instructions into PDF submissions to assess LLMs' susceptibility to prompt injection. Our findings show that LLMs consistently inflate ratings for weaker papers while aligning more closely with human judgments on stronger contributions. Moreover, while overarching malicious prompts induce only minor shifts in topical focus, explicitly field-specific instructions successfully manipulate specific aspects of LLM-generated reviews. This study underscores both the promises and perils of integrating LLMs into peer review and points to the importance of designing safeguards that ensure integrity and trust in future review processes."
2509.09921,"Toxic Online Content (TOC) includes messages on digital platforms that are harmful, hostile, or damaging to constructive public discourse. Individuals, organizations, and LLMs respond to TOC through counterspeech or counternarrative initiatives. There is a wide variation in their goals, terminology, response strategies, and methods of evaluating impact. This paper identifies a taxonomy of online response strategies, which we call Online Discourse Engagement (ODE), to include any type of online speech to build healthier online public discourse. The literature on ODE makes contradictory assumptions about ODE goals and rarely distinguishes between them or rigorously evaluates their effectiveness. This paper categorizes 25 distinct ODE strategies, from humor and distraction to empathy, solidarity, and fact-based rebuttals, and groups these into a taxonomy of five response categories: defusing and distracting, engaging the speaker's perspective, identifying shared values, upstanding for victims, and information and fact-building. The paper then systematically reviews the evidence base for each of these categories. By clarifying definitions, cataloging response strategies, and providing a meta-analysis of research papers on these strategies, this article aims to bring coherence to the study of ODE and to strengthen evidence-informed approaches for fostering constructive ODE."
2509.10083,"Built environment, formed of a plethora of patterns of building, streets, and plots, has a profound impact on how cities are perceived and function. While various methods exist to classify urban patterns, they often lack a strong theoretical foundation, are not scalable beyond a local level, or sacrifice detail for broader application. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Morphotope Classification (HiMoC), a novel, theory-driven, and computationally scalable method of classification of built form. HiMoC operationalises the idea of a morphotope - the smallest locality with a distinctive character - using a bespoke regionalisation method SA3 (Spatial Agglomerative Adaptive Aggregation), to delineate contiguous, morphologically distinct localities. These are further organised into a hierarchical taxonomic tree reflecting their dissimilarity based on morphometric profile derived from buildings and streets retrieved from open data, allowing flexible, interpretable classification of built fabric, that can be applied beyond a scale of a single country. The method is tested on a subset of countries of Central Europe, grouping over 90 million building footprints into over 500,000 morphotopes. The method extends the capabilities of available morphometric analyses, while offering a complementary perspective to existing large scale data products, which are focusing primarily on land use or use conceptual definition of urban fabric types. This theory-grounded, reproducible, unsupervised and scalable method facilitates a nuanced understanding of urban structure, with broad applications in urban planning, environmental analysis, and socio-spatial studies."
2509.1022,"The rise of AI has been rapid, becoming a leading sector for investment and promising disruptive impacts across the economy. Within the critical analysis of the economic impacts, AI has been aligned to the critical literature on data power and platform capitalism - further concentrating power and value capture amongst a small number of ""big tech"" leaders.The equally rapid rise of openness in AI (here taken to be claims made by AI firms about openness, ""open source"" and free provision) signals an interesting development. It highlights an emerging ecosystem of open AI models, datasets and toolchains, involving massive capital investment. It poses questions as to whether open resources can support technological transfer and the ability for catch-up, even in the face of AI industry power.This work seeks to add conceptual clarity to these debates by conceptualising openness in AI as a unique type of interfirm relation and therefore amenable to value chain analysis. This approach then allows consideration of the capitalist dynamics of ""outsourcing"" of foundational firms in value chains, and consequently the types of governance and control that might emerge downstream as AI is adopted. This work, therefore, extends previous mapping of AI value chains to build a framework which links foundational AI with downstream value chains.Overall, this work extends our understanding of AI as a productive sector. While the work remains critical of the power of leading AI firms, openness in AI may lead to potential spillovers stemming from the intense competition for global technological leadership in AI."
2509.10289,"The deployment of capable AI agents raises fresh questions about safety, human-machine relationships and social coordination. We argue for greater engagement by scientists, scholars, engineers and policymakers with the implications of a world increasingly populated by AI agents. We explore key challenges that must be addressed to ensure that interactions between humans and agents, and among agents themselves, remain broadly beneficial."
2509.10571,"University dropout rates in Morocco continue to increase, with approximately 49 percent of students leaving university before graduating, despite the successive reforms and measures taken to achieve Morocco's 2015_2030 strategic vision in the higher education sector : For a university of equity, quality and promotion, which raises questions about the state of knowledge on social inclusion at the university, capable of informing decision-making and the achievement of this strategic vision. While previous studies have used a quantitative approach with an exploratory purpose, to identify the main factors that affect the inclusion of students on university campuses. Knowledge that we consider insufficient to create general and regular knowledge, beyond the cases studied, on the exhaustiveness of these factors, no study has chosen a mixed approach (qualitative and quantitative) to create knowledge on the factors strengthening the attractiveness of the campus environment. Which brings us to our central question: How does a mixed approach promote the creation of general and regular knowledge on the factors enabling the inclusion of students in the campus environment?"
2509.10576,"This study investigates the aesthetic experience and educational value of collaborative artmaking with generative artificial intelligence (AI) among young learners and art students. Based on a survey of 112 participants, we examine how human creators renegotiate their roles, how conventional notions of originality are challenged, how the creative process is transformed, and how aesthetic judgment is formed in human--AI co-creation. Empirically, participants generally view AI as a partner that stimulates ideation and expands creative boundaries rather than a passive tool, while simultaneously voicing concerns about stylistic homogenization and the erosion of traditional authorship. Theoretically, we synthesize Dewey's aesthetics of experience, Ihde's postphenomenology, and actor--network theory (ANT) into a single analytical framework to unpack the dynamics between human creators and AI as a non-human actant. Findings indicate (i) a fluid subjectivity in which creators shift across multiple stances (director, dialogic partner, discoverer); (ii) an iterative, dialogic workflow (intent--generate--select--refine) that centers critical interpretation; and (iii) an educational value shift from technical skill training toward higher-order competencies such as critical judgment, cross-modal ideation, and reflexivity. We argue that arts education should cultivate a \emph{critical co-creation} stance toward technology, guiding learners to collaborate with AI while preserving human distinctiveness in concept formation, judgment, and meaning-making."
2509.10578,"Computational social science research, particularly online studies, often involves exposing participants to the adverse phenomenon the researchers aim to study. Examples include presenting conspiracy theories in surveys, exposing systems to hackers, or deploying bots on social media. We refer to these as ""social challenge studies,"" by analogy with medical research, where challenge studies advance vaccine and drug testing but also raise ethical concerns about exposing healthy individuals to risk. Medical challenge studies are guided by established ethical frameworks that regulate how participants are exposed to agents under controlled conditions. In contrast, social challenge studies typically occur with less control and fewer clearly defined ethical guidelines. In this paper, we examine the ethical frameworks developed for medical challenge studies and consider how their principles might inform social research. Our aim is to initiate discussion on formalizing ethical standards for social challenge studies and encourage long-term evaluation of potential harms."
2509.10582,"Exploratory learning environments (ELEs), such as simulation-based platforms and open-ended science curricula, promote hands-on exploration and problem-solving but make it difficult for teachers to gain timely insights into students' conceptual understanding. This paper presents LearnLens, a generative AI (GenAI)-enhanced teacher-facing dashboard designed to support problem-based instruction in middle school science. LearnLens processes students' open-ended responses from digital assessments to provide various insights, including sample responses, word clouds, bar charts, and AI-generated summaries. These features elucidate students' thinking, enabling teachers to adjust their instruction based on emerging patterns of understanding. The dashboard was informed by teacher input during professional development sessions and implemented within a middle school Earth science curriculum. We report insights from teacher interviews that highlight the dashboard's usability and potential to guide teachers' instruction in the classroom."
2509.10584,"Clinical trials (CT) are essential for advancing medical research and treatment, yet efficiently recruiting eligible participants -- each of whom must meet complex eligibility criteria -- remains a significant challenge. Traditional recruitment approaches, such as advertisements or electronic health record screening within hospitals, are often time-consuming and geographically constrained. This work addresses the recruitment challenge by leveraging the vast amount of health-related information individuals share on social media platforms. With the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated text understanding, we pose the central research question: Can LLM-driven tools facilitate CT recruitment by identifying potential participants through their engagement on social media? To investigate this question, we introduce TRIALQA, a novel dataset comprising two social media collections from the subreddits on colon cancer and prostate cancer. Using eligibility criteria from public real-world CTs, experienced annotators are hired to annotate TRIALQA to indicate (1) whether a social media user meets a given eligibility criterion and (2) the user's stated reasons for interest in participating in CT. We benchmark seven widely used LLMs on these two prediction tasks, employing six distinct training and inference strategies. Our extensive experiments reveal that, while LLMs show considerable promise, they still face challenges in performing the complex, multi-hop reasoning needed to accurately assess eligibility criteria."
2509.1059,"The concept of Machine Unlearning (MU) has gained popularity in various domains due to its ability to address several issues in Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly those related to privacy, security, bias mitigation, and adaptability. With these abilities, MU is evolving into a promising technology in upholding Responsible AI principles and optimizing ML models' performance. However, despite its promising potential, the concept has not received much attention in the education sector. In an attempt to encourage further uptake of this promising technology in the educational landscape, this paper demonstrates that MU indeed has great potential to serve as a practical mechanism for operationalizing Responsible AI principles as well as an essential tool for Adaptive AI within the educational application domain hence fostering trust in AI-driven educational systems. Through a structured review of 42 peer-reviewed sources, we identify four domains where MU holds particular promise namely privacy protection, resilience against adversarial inputs, mitigation of systemic bias, and adaptability in evolving learning contexts. We systematically explore these potentials and their interventions to core challenges in ML-based education systems. As a conceptual contribution, we present a reference Machine Unlearning application architecture for Responsible and Adaptive AI (MU-RAAI) in education context."
2509.10591,"We explore the effectiveness and reliability of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based grading system for a handwritten general chemistry exam, comparing AI-assigned scores to human grading across various types of questions. Exam pages and grading rubrics were uploaded as images to account for chemical reaction equations, short and long open-ended answers, numerical and symbolic answer derivations, drawing, and sketching in pencil-and-paper format. Using linear regression analyses and psychometric evaluations, the investigation reveals high agreement between AI and human graders for textual and chemical reaction questions, while highlighting lower reliability for numerical and graphical tasks. The findings emphasize the necessity for human oversight to ensure grading accuracy, based on selective filtering. The results indicate promising applications for AI in routine assessment tasks, though careful consideration must be given to student perceptions of fairness and trust in integrating AI-based grading into educational practice."
2509.10596,"Real-time voice interfaces using multimodal Generative AI (GenAI) can potentially address the accessibility needs of novice programmers with disabilities (e.g., related to vision). Yet, little is known about how novices interact with GenAI tools and their feedback quality in the form of audio output. This paper analyzes audio dialogues from nine 9th-grade students using a voice-enabled tutor (powered by OpenAI's Realtime API) in an authentic classroom setting while learning Python. We examined the students' voice prompts and AI's responses (1210 messages) by using qualitative coding. We also gathered students' perceptions via the Partner Modeling Questionnaire. The GenAI Voice Tutor primarily offered feedback on mistakes and next steps, but its correctness was limited (71.4% correct out of 416 feedback outputs). Quality issues were observed, particularly when the AI attempted to utter programming code elements. Students used the GenAI voice tutor primarily for debugging. They perceived it as competent, only somewhat human-like, and flexible. The present study is the first to explore the interaction dynamics of real-time voice GenAI tutors and novice programmers, informing future educational tool design and potentially addressing accessibility needs of diverse learners."
2509.106,"The National Running Club Database (NRCD) aggregates 15,397 race results of 5,585 athletes from the 2023 and 2024 cross country seasons. This paper introduces the NRCD dataset, which provides insights into individual athlete progressions, enabling data-driven decision-making. Analysis reveals that runners' improvement per calendar day for women, racing 6,000m, and men, racing 8,000m, is more pronounced in athletes with slower initial race times and those who race more frequently. Additionally, we factor in course conditions, including weather and elevation gain, to standardize improvement. While the NRCD shows a gender imbalance, 3,484 men vs. 2,101 women, the racing frequency between genders is comparable. This publication makes the NRCD dataset accessible to the research community, addressing a previous challenge where smaller datasets, often limited to 500 entries, had to be manually scraped from the internet. Focusing on club athletes rather than elite professionals offers a unique lens into the performance of real-world runners who balance competition with academics and other commitments. These results serve as a valuable resource for runners, coaches, and teams, bridging the gap between raw data and applied sports science."
2509.10647,"The growing need for automated and personalized feedback in programming education has led to recent interest in leveraging generative AI for feedback generation. However, current approaches tend to rely on prompt engineering techniques in which predefined prompts guide the AI to generate feedback. This can result in rigid and constrained responses that fail to accommodate the diverse needs of students and do not reflect the style of human-written feedback from tutors or peers. In this study, we explore learnersourcing as a means to fine-tune language models for generating feedback that is more similar to that written by humans, particularly peer students. Specifically, we asked students to act in the flipped role of a tutor and write feedback on programs containing bugs. We collected approximately 1,900 instances of student-written feedback on multiple programming problems and buggy programs. To establish a baseline for comparison, we analyzed a sample of 300 instances based on correctness, length, and how the bugs are described. Using this data, we fine-tuned open-access generative models, specifically Llama3 and Phi3. Our findings indicate that fine-tuning models on learnersourced data not only produces feedback that better matches the style of feedback written by students, but also improves accuracy compared to feedback generated through prompt engineering alone, even though some student-written feedback is incorrect. This surprising finding highlights the potential of student-centered fine-tuning to improve automated feedback systems in programming education."
2509.10653,"AI-driven digital ecosystems span diverse stakeholders including technology firms, regulators, accelerators and civil society, yet often lack cohesive ethical governance. This paper proposes a four-pillar framework (SCOR) to embed accountability, fairness, and inclusivity across such multi-actor networks. Leveraging a design science approach, we develop a Shared Ethical Charter(S), structured Co-Design and Stakeholder Engagement protocols(C), a system of Continuous Oversight and Learning(O), and Adaptive Regulatory Alignment strategies(R). Each component includes practical guidance, from lite modules for resource-constrained start-ups to in-depth auditing systems for larger consortia. Through illustrative vignettes in healthcare, finance, and smart city contexts, we demonstrate how the framework can harmonize organizational culture, leadership incentives, and cross-jurisdictional compliance. Our mixed-method KPI design further ensures that quantitative targets are complemented by qualitative assessments of user trust and cultural change. By uniting ethical principles with scalable operational structures, this paper offers a replicable pathway toward responsible AI innovation in complex digital ecosystems."
2509.10717,"The technology industry offers exciting and diverse career opportunities, ranging from traditional software development to emerging fields such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and data science. Career fairs play a crucial role in helping Computer Science (CS) students understand the various career pathways available to them in the industry. However, limited research exists on how CS students experience and benefit from these events. Through a survey of 86 students, we investigate their motivations for attending, preparation strategies, and learning outcomes, including exposure to new career paths and technologies. We envision our findings providing valuable insights for career services professionals, educators, and industry leaders in improving the career development processes of CS students."
2509.1072,"Current cross-platform social media analyses primarily focus on the textual features of posts, often lacking multimodal analysis due to past technical limitations. This study addresses this gap by examining how U.S. legislators in the 118th Congress strategically use social media platforms to adapt their public personas by emphasizing different topics and stances. Leveraging the Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for fine-grained text and image analysis, we examine 540 legislators personal website and social media, including Facebook, X (Twitter), TikTok. We find that legislators tailor their topics and stances to project distinct public personas on different platforms. Democrats tend to prioritize TikTok, which has a younger user base, while Republicans are more likely to express stronger stances on established platforms such as Facebook and X (Twitter), which offer broader audience reach. Topic analysis reveals alignment with constituents' key concerns, while stances and polarization vary by platform and topic. Large-scale image analysis shows Republicans employing more formal visuals to project authority, whereas Democrats favor campaign-oriented imagery. These findings highlight the potential interplay between platform features, audience demographics, and partisan goals in shaping political communication. By providing insights into multimodal strategies, this study contributes to understanding the role of social media in modern political discourse and communications."
2509.11332,"Purpose: The governance of artificial iintelligence (AI) systems requires a structured approach that connects high-level regulatory principles with practical implementation. Existing frameworks lack clarity on how regulations translate into conformity mechanisms, leading to gaps in compliance and enforcement. This paper addresses this critical gap in AI governance.Methodology/Approach: A five-layer AI governance framework is proposed, spanning from broad regulatory mandates to specific standards, assessment methodologies, and certification processes. By narrowing its scope through progressively focused layers, the framework provides a structured pathway to meet technical, regulatory, and ethical requirements. Its applicability is validated through two case studies on AI fairness and AI incident reporting.Findings: The case studies demonstrate the framework's ability to identify gaps in legal mandates, standardization, and implementation. It adapts to both global and region-specific AI governance needs, mapping regulatory mandates with practical applications to improve compliance and risk management.Practical Implications - By offering a clear and actionable roadmap, this work contributes to global AI governance by equipping policymakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders with a model to enhance compliance and risk management.Social Implications: The framework supports the development of policies that build public trust and promote the ethical use of AI for the benefit of society.Originality/Value: This study proposes a five-layer AI governance framework that bridges high-level regulatory mandates and implementation guidelines. Validated through case studies on AI fairness and incident reporting, it identifies gaps such as missing standardized assessment procedures and reporting mechanisms, providing a structured foundation for targeted governance measures."
2509.11371,"This study aims to evaluate machine intelligence through artistic creativity by employing a modified version of the Turing Test inspired by Lady Lovelace. It investigates two hypotheses: whether human judges can reliably distinguish AI-generated artworks from human-created ones and whether AI-generated art achieves comparable aesthetic value to human-crafted works. The research contributes to understanding machine creativity and its implications for cognitive science and AI technology. Participants with educational backgrounds in cognitive and computer science play the role of interrogators and evaluated whether a set of paintings was AI-generated or human-created. Here, we utilise parallel-paired and viva voce versions of the Turing Test. Additionally, aesthetic evaluations are collected to compare the perceived quality of AI-generated images against human-created art. This dual-method approach allows us to examine human judgment under different testing conditions. We find that participants struggle to distinguish between AI-generated and human-created artworks reliably, performing no better than chance under certain conditions. Furthermore, AI-generated art is rated as aesthetically as human-crafted works. Our findings challenge traditional assumptions about human creativity and demonstrate that AI systems can generate outputs that resonate with human sensibilities while meeting the criteria of creative intelligence. This study advances the understanding of machine creativity by combining elements of the Turing and Lovelace Tests. Unlike prior studies focused on laypeople or artists, this research examines participants with domain expertise. It also provides a comparative analysis of two distinct testing methodologies (parallel-paired and viva voce) offering new insights into the evaluation of machine intelligence."
2509.11732,"Judicial reasoning in criminal judgments typically consists of three elements: Holding , evidentiary considerations, and subsumption. These elements form the logical foundation of judicial decision-making but remain unstructured in court documents, limiting large-scale empirical analysis. In this study, we design annotation guidelines to define and distinguish these reasoning components and construct the first dedicated datasets from Taiwanese High Court and Supreme Court criminal judgments. Using the bilingual large language model ChatGLM2, we fine-tune classifiers for each category. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that the model achieves approximately 80% accuracy, showing that judicial reasoning patterns can be systematically identified by large language models even with relatively small annotated corpora. Our contributions are twofold: (1) the creation of structured annotation rules and datasets for Holding, evidentiary considerations, and subsumption; and (2) the demonstration that such reasoning can be computationally learned. This work lays the foundation for large-scale empirical legal studies and legal sociology, providing new tools to analyze judicial fairness, consistency, and transparency."
2509.11913,"Under what conditions would an artificially intelligent system have wellbeing? Despite its obvious bearing on the ethics of human interactions with artificial systems, this question has received little attention. Because all major theories of wellbeing hold that an individual's welfare level is partially determined by their mental life, we begin by considering whether artificial systems have mental states. We show that a wide range of theories of mental states, when combined with leading theories of wellbeing, predict that certain existing artificial systems have wellbeing. While we do not claim to demonstrate conclusively that AI systems have wellbeing, we argue that our metaphysical and moral uncertainty about AI wellbeing requires us dramatically to reassess our relationship with the intelligent systems we create."
2509.11947,"This project addresses a critical pedagogical need: offering students continuous, on-demand academic assistance beyond conventional reception hours. I present a domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by a quantized Mistral-7B Instruct model and deployed as a Telegram bot. The assistant enhances learning by delivering real-time, personalized responses aligned with the ""Introduction to Parallel Processing"" course materials. GPU acceleration significantly improves inference latency, enabling practical deployment on consumer hardware. This approach demonstrates how consumer GPUs can enable affordable, private, and effective AI tutoring for HPC education."
2509.1219,"When survival instincts conflict with human welfare, how do Large Language Models (LLMs) make ethical choices? This fundamental tension becomes critical as LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We introduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in multi-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically permissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their immediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource that is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a striking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical misalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral archetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide quantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically leads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical Self-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt and satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an internal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while increasing cooperative behaviors. The code is publicly available at:this https URL"
2509.12283,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted in just a few years from novelty to ubiquity, raising fundamental questions for data science education. Tasks once used to teach coding, writing, and problem-solving can now be completed by LLMs, forcing educators to reconsider both pedagogy and assessment. To understand how instructors are adapting, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 42 instructors from 33 institutions in 10 countries in June and July 2025. Our qualitative analysis reveals a pragmatic mix of optimism and concern. Many respondents view LLMs as inevitable classroom tools -- comparable to calculators or Wikipedia -- while others worry about de-skilling, misplaced confidence, and uneven integration across institutions. Around 58 per cent have already introduced demonstrations, guided activities, or make extensive use of LLMs in their courses, though most expect change to remain slow and uneven. That said, 31 per cent have not used LLMs to teach students and do not plan to. We highlight some instructional innovations, including AI-aware assessments, reflective use of LLMs as tutors, and course-specific chatbots. By sharing these perspectives, we aim to help data science educators adapt collectively to ensure curricula keep pace with technological change."
2509.12415,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are entering urban governance, yet their outputs are highly sensitive to prompts that carry value judgments. We propose Prompt Commons - a versioned, community-maintained repository of prompts with governance metadata, licensing, and moderation - to steer model behaviour toward pluralism. Using a Montreal dataset (443 human prompts; 3,317 after augmentation), we pilot three governance states (open, curated, veto-enabled). On a contested policy benchmark, a single-author prompt yields 24 percent neutral outcomes; commons-governed prompts raise neutrality to 48-52 percent while retaining decisiveness where appropriate. In a synthetic incident log, a veto-enabled regime reduces time-to-remediation for harmful outputs from 30.5 +/- 8.9 hours (open) to 5.6 +/- 1.5 hours. We outline licensing (CC BY/BY-SA for prompts with optional OpenRAIL-style restrictions for artefacts), auditable moderation, and safeguards against dominance capture. Prompt governance offers a practical lever for cities to align AI with local values and accountability."
2509.12455,"Artificial Intelligence for Social Good (AI4SG) is a growing area exploring AI's potential to address social issues like public health. Yet prior work has shown limited evidence of its tangible benefits for intended communities, and projects frequently face inadequate community engagement and sustainability challenges. Funding agendas play a crucial role in framing AI4SG initiatives and shaping their approaches. Through a qualitative analysis of 35 funding documents -- representing about $410 million USD in total investments, we reveal dissonances between AI4SG's stated intentions for positive social impact and the techno-centric approaches that some funding agendas promoted. Drawing on our findings, we offer recommendations for funders to scaffold approaches that balance both contextual understanding and technical capacities in future funding call designs. We call for greater engagement between AI4SG funders and the HCI community to support community engagement work in the funding program design process."
2509.12503,"Rapid computational developments - particularly the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) - increasingly shape social scientific research while raising new questions about in-depth qualitative methods such as ethnography and interviewing. Building on classic debates about using computers to analyze qualitative data, we revisit longstanding concerns and assess possibilities and dangers in an era of automation, AI chatbots, and 'big data.' We first historicize developments by revisiting classical and emergent concerns about qualitative analysis with computers. We then introduce a typology of contemporary modes of engagement - streamlining workflows, scaling up projects, hybrid analytical approaches, and the sociology of computation - alongside rejection of computational analyses. We illustrate these approaches with detailed workflow examples from a large-scale ethnographic study and guidance for solo researchers. We argue for a pragmatic sociological approach that moves beyond dualisms of technological optimism versus rejection to show how computational tools - simultaneously dangerous and generative - can be adapted to support longstanding qualitative aims when used carefully in ways aligned with core methodological commitments."
2509.12577,"In an era of increasing societal fragmentation, political polarization, and erosion of public trust in institutions, representative deliberative assemblies are emerging as a promising democratic forum for developing effective policy outcomes on complex global issues. Despite theoretical attention, there remains limited empirical work that systematically traces how specific ideas evolve, are prioritized, or are discarded during deliberation to form policy recommendations. Addressing these gaps, this work poses two central questions: (1) How might we trace the evolution and distillation of ideas into concrete recommendations within deliberative assemblies? (2) How does the deliberative process shape delegate perspectives and influence voting dynamics over the course of the assembly? To address these questions, we develop LLM-based methodologies for empirically analyzing transcripts from a tech-enhanced in-person deliberative assembly. The framework identifies and visualizes the space of expressed suggestions. We also empirically reconstruct each delegate's evolving perspective throughout the assembly. Our methods contribute novel empirical insights into deliberative processes and demonstrate how LLMs can surface high-resolution dynamics otherwise invisible in traditional assembly outputs."
2509.13032,"The Access to Algorithmic Justice project (A2AJ) is an open-source alternative to the Canadian Legal Information Institute (CanLII). At a moment when technology promises to enable new ways of working with law, CanLII is becoming an impediment to the free access of law and access to justice movements because it restricts bulk and programmatic access to Canadian legal data. This means that Canada is staring down a digital divide: well-resourced actors have the best new technological tools and, because CanLII has disclaimed leadership, the public only gets second-rate tools. This article puts CanLII in its larger historical context and shows how long and deep efforts to democratize access to Canadian legal data are, and how often they are thwarted by private industry. We introduce the A2AJ's Canadian Legal Data project, which provides open access to over 116,000 court decisions and 5,000 statutes through multiple channels including APIs, machine learning datasets, and AI integration protocols. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate how open legal data enables courts to conduct evidence-based assessments and allows developers to create tools for practitioners serving low-income communities."
2509.13156,"Blockchain has been promoted as a remedy for coordination in fragmented, multi-stakeholder ecosystems, yet many projects stall at pilot stage. Using a design-science approach, we develop the Hybrid Cooperative (HC), a digitally native governance architecture that combines smart-contract coordination with a minimal, code-deferent legal interface and jurisdictional modules. This selective decentralization decentralizes rules where programmability lowers agency and verification costs, and centralizes only what is needed for enforceability. A post-case evaluation against two traceability initiatives in supply chains illustrates how the HC improves distributed task management, verifiable information, incentive alignment, institutional interoperability, and scalable, contestable governance. The paper contributes to Information Systems by specifying a socio-technical model for scalable, multi-stakeholder coordination across regulatory and organizational boundaries."
2509.13265,"This paper conceptualizes Large Language Models (LLMs) as a form of mixed public goods within digital infrastructure, analyzing their economic properties through a comprehensive theoretical framework. We develop mathematical models to quantify the non-rivalry characteristics, partial excludability, and positive externalities of LLMs. Through comparative analysis of open-source and closed-source development paths, we identify systematic differences in resource allocation efficiency, innovation trajectories, and access equity. Our empirical research evaluates the spillover effects and network externalities of LLMs across different domains, including knowledge diffusion, innovation acceleration, and industry transformation. Based on these findings, we propose policy recommendations for balancing innovation incentives with equitable access, including public-private partnership mechanisms, computational resource democratization, and governance structures that optimize social welfare. This interdisciplinary approach contributes to understanding the economic nature of foundation AI models and provides policy guidance for their development as critical digital infrastructure"
2509.13337,"Understanding how users authentically interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge in human-computer interaction research. Most existing studies rely on self-reported usage patterns or controlled experimental conditions, potentially missing genuine behavioral adaptations. This study presents a behavioral analysis of the use of English-speaking urban professional ChatGPT in India based on 238 authentic, unedited user prompts from 40 participants in 15+ Indian cities, collected using retrospective survey methodology in August 2025. Using authentic retrospective prompt collection via anonymous social media survey to minimize real-time observer effects, we analyzed genuine usage patterns. Key findings include: (1) 85\% daily usage rate (34/40 users) indicating mature adoption beyond experimental use, (2) evidence of cross-domain integration spanning professional, personal, health and creative contexts among the majority of users, (3) 42.5\% (17/40) primarily use ChatGPT for professional workflows with evidence of real-time problem solving integration, and (4) cultural context navigation strategies with users incorporating Indian cultural specifications in their prompts. Users develop sophisticated adaptation techniques and the formation of advisory relationships for personal guidance. The study reveals the progression from experimental to essential workflow dependency, with users treating ChatGPT as an integrated life assistant rather than a specialized tool. However, the findings are limited to urban professionals in English recruited through social media networks and require a larger demographic validation. This work contributes a novel methodology to capture authentic AI usage patterns and provides evidence-based insights into cultural adaptation strategies among this specific demographic of users."
2509.1334,"This short paper provides a means to classify augmentation technologies to reconceptualize them as sociotechnical, discursive and rhetorical phenomena, rather than only through technological classifications. It identifies a set of value systems that constitute augmentation technologies within discourses, namely, the intent to enhance, automate, and build efficiency. This short paper makes a contribution to digital literacy surrounding augmentation technology emergence, as well as the more specific area of AI literacy, which can help identify unintended consequences implied at the design stages of these technologies."
2509.13345,"Hallucination in generative AI is often treated as a technical failure to produce factually correct output. Yet this framing underrepresents the broader significance of hallucinated content in language models, which may appear fluent, persuasive, and contextually appropriate while conveying distortions that escape conventional accuracy checks. This paper critically examines how regulatory and evaluation frameworks have inherited a narrow view of hallucination, one that prioritises surface verifiability over deeper questions of meaning, influence, and impact. We propose a layered approach to understanding hallucination risks, encompassing epistemic instability, user misdirection, and social-scale effects. Drawing on interdisciplinary sources and examining instruments such as the EU AI Act and the GDPR, we show that current governance models struggle to address hallucination when it manifests as ambiguity, bias reinforcement, or normative convergence. Rather than improving factual precision alone, we argue for regulatory responses that account for languages generative nature, the asymmetries between system and user, and the shifting boundaries between information, persuasion, and harm."
2509.13348,"Textbooks are a cornerstone of education, but they have a fundamental limitation: they are a one-size-fits-all medium. Any new material or alternative representation requires arduous human effort, so that textbooks cannot be adapted in a scalable manner. We present an approach for transforming and augmenting textbooks using generative AI, adding layers of multiple representations and personalization while maintaining content integrity and quality. We refer to the system built with this approach as Learn Your Way. We report pedagogical evaluations of the different transformations and augmentations, and present the results of a a randomized control trial, highlighting the advantages of learning with Learn Your Way over regular textbook usage."
2509.13355,"The emergence of synthetic data for privacy protection, training data generation, or simply convenient access to quasi-realistic data in any shape or volume complicates the concept of ground truth. Synthetic data mimic real-world observations, but do not refer to external features. This lack of a representational relationship, however, not prevent researchers from using synthetic data as training data for AI models and ground truth repositories. It is claimed that the lack of data realism is not merely an acceptable tradeoff, but often leads to better model performance than realistic data: compensate for known biases, prevent overfitting and support generalization, and make the models more robust in dealing with unexpected outliers. Indeed, injecting noisy and outright implausible data into training sets can be beneficial for the model. This greatly complicates usual assumptions based on which representational accuracy determines data fidelity (garbage in - garbage out). Furthermore, ground truth becomes a self-referential affair, in which the labels used as a ground truth repository are themselves synthetic products of a generative model and as such not connected to real-world observations. My paper examines how ML researchers and practitioners bootstrap ground truth under such paradoxical circumstances without relying on the stable ground of representation and real-world reference. It will also reflect on the broader implications of a shift from a representational to what could be described as a mimetic or iconic concept of data."
2509.13356,"The challenge of aligning artificial intelligence (AI) with human values persists due to the abstract and often conflicting nature of moral principles and the opacity of existing approaches. This paper introduces CogniAlign, a multi-agent deliberation framework based on naturalistic moral realism, that grounds moral reasoning in survivability, defined across individual and collective dimensions, and operationalizes it through structured deliberations among discipline-specific scientist agents. Each agent, representing neuroscience, psychology, sociology, and evolutionary biology, provides arguments and rebuttals that are synthesized by an arbiter into transparent and empirically anchored judgments. We evaluate CogniAlign on classic and novel moral questions and compare its outputs against GPT-4o using a five-part ethical audit framework. Results show that CogniAlign consistently outperforms the baseline across more than sixty moral questions, with average performance gains of 16.2 points in analytic quality, 14.3 points in breadth, and 28.4 points in depth of explanation. In the Heinz dilemma, for example, CogniAlign achieved an overall score of 89.2 compared to GPT-4o's 69.2, demonstrating a decisive advantage in handling moral reasoning. By reducing black-box reasoning and avoiding deceptive alignment, CogniAlign highlights the potential of interdisciplinary deliberation as a scalable pathway for safe and transparent AI alignment."
2509.13359,"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT are transforming the educational landscape, prompting reconsideration of traditional assessment practices. In parallel, universities are exploring alternatives to in-person, closed-book examinations, raising concerns about academic integrity and pedagogical alignment in uninvigilated settings. This study investigates whether traditional closed-book mathematics examinations retain their pedagogical relevance when hypothetically administered in uninvigilated, open-book settings with GenAI access. Adopting an empirical approach, we generate, transcribe, and blind-mark GenAI submissions to eight undergraduate mathematics examinations at a Russell Group university, spanning the entirety of the first-year curriculum. By combining independent GenAI responses to individual questions, we enable a meaningful evaluation of GenAI performance, both at the level of modules and across the first-year curriculum. We find that GenAI attainment is at the level of a first-class degree, though current performance can vary between modules. Further, we find that GenAI performance is remarkably consistent when viewed across the entire curriculum, significantly more so than that of students in invigilated examinations. Our findings evidence the need for redesigning assessments in mathematics for unsupervised settings, and highlight the potential reduction in pedagogical value of current standards in the era of generative artificial intelligence."
2509.13365,"The increasing use of generative AI in scientific writing raises urgent questions about attribution and intellectual credit. When a researcher employs ChatGPT to draft a manuscript, the resulting text may echo ideas from sources the author has never encountered. If an AI system reproduces insights from, for example, an obscure 1975 paper without citation, does this constitute plagiarism? We argue that such cases exemplify the 'provenance problem': a systematic breakdown in the chain of scholarly credit. Unlike conventional plagiarism, this phenomenon does not involve intent to deceive (researchers may disclose AI use and act in good faith) yet still benefit from the uncredited intellectual contributions of others. This dynamic creates a novel category of attributional harm that current ethical and professional frameworks fail to address. As generative AI becomes embedded across disciplines, the risk that significant ideas will circulate without recognition threatens both the reputational economy of science and the demands of epistemic justice. This Perspective analyzes how AI challenges established norms of authorship, introduces conceptual tools for understanding the provenance problem, and proposes strategies to preserve integrity and fairness in scholarly communication."
2509.1337,"Single Transferable Vote (STV) counting, used in several jurisdictions in Australia, is a system for choosing multiple election winners given voters' preferences among candidates. The system is complex and it is not always obvious how an individual's vote contributes to candidates' tallies across rounds of tabulation. This short paper presents a demonstration system that allows voters to enter an example vote in a past Australian STV election, and see: (i)~how that vote would have been transferred between candidates; and (ii)~how much that vote would have contributed to the tallies of relevant candidates, across rounds of tabulation."
2509.13387,"The upsurge of policies and guidelines that aim to ensure Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are safe and trustworthy has led to a fragmented landscape of AI governance. The European Union (EU) is a key actor in the development of such policies and guidelines. Its High-Level Expert Group (HLEG) issued an influential set of guidelines for trustworthy AI, followed in 2024 by the adoption of the EU AI Act. While the EU policies and guidelines are expected to be aligned, they may differ in their scope, areas of emphasis, degrees of normativity, and priorities in relation to AI. To gain a broad understanding of AI governance from the EU perspective, we leverage qualitative thematic analysis approaches to uncover prevalent themes in key EU documents, including the AI Act and the HLEG Ethics Guidelines. We further employ quantitative topic modelling approaches, specifically through the use of the BERTopic model, to enhance the results and increase the document sample to include EU AI policy documents published post-2018. We present a novel perspective on EU policies, tracking the evolution of its approach to addressing AI governance."
2509.13391,"Generative AI is changing our way of interacting with technology, others, and ourselves. Systems such as Microsoft copilot, Gemini and the expected Apple intelligence still awaits our prompt for action. Yet, it is likely that AI assistant systems will only become better at predicting our behaviour and acting on our behalf. Imagine new generations of generative and predictive AI deciding what you might like best at a new restaurant, picking an outfit that increases your chances on your date with a partner also chosen by the same or a similar system. Far from a science fiction scenario, the goal of several research programs is to build systems capable of assisting us in exactly this manner. The prospect urges us to rethink human-technology relations, but it also invites us to question how such systems might change the way we relate to ourselves. Building on our conception of the relational self, we question the possible effects of generative AI with respect to what we call the sphere of externalised output, the contextual sphere and the sphere of self-relating. In this paper, we attempt to deepen the existential considerations accompanying the AI revolution by outlining how generative AI enables the fulfilment of tasks and also increasingly anticipates, i.e. intercepts, our initiatives in these different spheres."
2509.13397,"Social scientists are now using large language models to create ""silicon samples"" - synthetic datasets intended to stand in for human respondents, aimed at revolutionising human subjects research. However, there are many analytic choices which must be made to produce these samples. Though many of these choices are defensible, their impact on sample quality is poorly understood. I map out these analytic choices and demonstrate how a very small number of decisions can dramatically change the correspondence between silicon samples and human data. Configurations (N = 252) varied substantially in their capacity to estimate (i) rank ordering of participants, (ii) response distributions, and (iii) between-scale correlations. Most critically, configurations were not consistent in quality: those that performed well on one dimension often performed poorly on another, implying that there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" configuration that optimises the accuracy of these samples. I call for greater attention to the threat of analytic flexibility in using silicon samples."
2509.134,"The adoption of large language models (LLMs) is transforming the peer review process, from assisting reviewers in writing more detailed evaluations to generating entire reviews automatically. While these capabilities offer exciting opportunities, they also raise critical concerns about fairness and reliability. In this paper, we investigate bias in LLM-generated peer reviews by conducting controlled experiments on sensitive metadata, including author affiliation and gender. Our analysis consistently shows affiliation bias favoring institutions highly ranked on common academic rankings. Additionally, we find some gender preferences, which, even though subtle in magnitude, have the potential to compound over time. Notably, we uncover implicit biases that become more evident with token-based soft ratings."
2509.13499,"Online artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are an important component of digital health interventions. These online algorithms are designed to continually learn and improve their performance as streaming data is collected on individuals. Deploying online AI presents a key challenge: balancing adaptability of online AI with reproducibility. Online AI in digital interventions is a rapidly evolving area, driven by advances in algorithms, sensors, software, and devices. Digital health intervention development and deployment is a continuous process, where implementation - including the AI decision-making algorithm - is interspersed with cycles of re-development and optimization. Each deployment informs the next, making iterative deployment a defining characteristic of this field. This iterative nature underscores the importance of reproducibility: data collected across deployments must be accurately stored to have scientific utility, algorithm behavior must be auditable, and results must be comparable over time to facilitate scientific discovery and trustworthy refinement. This paper proposes a reproducible scientific workflow for developing, deploying, and analyzing online AI decision-making algorithms in digital health interventions. Grounded in practical experience from multiple real-world deployments, this workflow addresses key challenges to reproducibility across all phases of the online AI algorithm development life-cycle."
2509.13729,"The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a fundamental shock to the economics of information production. By asymmetrically collapsing the marginal cost of generating low-quality, synthetic content while leaving high-quality production costly, AI systematically incentivizes information pollution. This paper develops a general equilibrium framework to analyze this challenge. We model the strategic interactions among a monopolistic platform, profit-maximizing producers, and utility-maximizing consumers in a three-stage game. The core of our model is a production technology with differential elasticities of substitution ($\sigma_L > 1 > \sigma_H$), which formalizes the insight that AI is a substitute for labor in low-quality production but a complement in high-quality creation. We prove the existence of a unique ""Polluted Information Equilibrium"" and demonstrate its inefficiency, which is driven by a threefold market failure: a production externality, a platform governance failure, and an information commons externality. Methodologically, we derive a theoretically-grounded Information Pollution Index (IPI) with endogenous welfare weights to measure ecosystem health. From a policy perspective, we show that a first-best outcome requires a portfolio of instruments targeting each failure. Finally, considering the challenges of deep uncertainty, we advocate for an adaptive governance framework where policy instruments are dynamically adjusted based on real-time IPI readings, offering a robust blueprint for regulating information markets in the age of AI."
2509.1373,"Since its launch in late 2022, ChatGPT has ignited widespread interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and broader Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions. As this new wave of AI permeates various sectors of society, we are continually uncovering both the potential and the limitations of existing AI tools.The need for adjustment is particularly significant in Computer Science Education (CSEd), as LLMs have evolved into core coding tools themselves, blurring the line between programming aids and intelligent systems, and reinforcing CSEd's role as a nexus of technology and pedagogy. The findings of our survey indicate that while AI technologies hold potential for enhancing learning experiences, such as through personalized learning paths, intelligent tutoring systems, and automated assessments, there are also emerging concerns. These include the risk of over-reliance on technology, the potential erosion of fundamental cognitive skills, and the challenge of maintaining equitable access to such innovations.Recent advancements represent a paradigm shift, transforming not only the content we teach but also the methods by which teaching and learning take place. Rather than placing the burden of adapting to AI technologies on students, educational institutions must take a proactive role in verifying, integrating, and applying new pedagogical approaches. Such efforts can help ensure that both educators and learners are equipped with the skills needed to navigate the evolving educational landscape shaped by these technological innovations."
2509.13854,"Background: Value alignment in computer science research is often used to refer to the process of aligning artificial intelligence with humans, but the way the phrase is used often lacks precision. Objectives: In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review to advance the understanding of value alignment in artificial intelligence by characterising the topic in the context of its research literature. We use this to suggest a more precise definition of the term. Methods: We analyse 172 value alignment research articles that have been published in recent years and synthesise their content using thematic analyses. Results: Our analysis leads to six themes: value alignment drivers & approaches; challenges in value alignment; values in value alignment; cognitive processes in humans and AI; human-agent teaming; and designing and developing value-aligned systems. Conclusions: By analysing these themes in the context of the literature we define value alignment as an ongoing process between humans and autonomous agents that aims to express and implement abstract values in diverse contexts, while managing the cognitive limits of both humans and AI agents and also balancing the conflicting ethical and political demands generated by the values in different groups. Our analysis gives rise to a set of research challenges and opportunities in the field of value alignment for future work."
2509.14088,"Nowadays, computing students often rely on both natural-language prompting and manual code editing to solve programming tasks. Yet we still lack a clear understanding of how these two modes are combined in practice, and how their usage varies with task complexity and student ability. In this paper, we investigate this through a large-scale study in an introductory programming course, collecting 13,305 interactions from 355 students during a three-day laboratory activity. Our analysis shows that students primarily use prompting to generate initial solutions, and then often enter short edit-run loops to refine their code following a failed execution. We find that manual editing becomes more frequent as task complexity increases, but most edits remain concise, with many affecting a single line of code. Higher-performing students tend to succeed using prompting alone, while lower-performing students rely more on edits. Student reflections confirm that prompting is helpful for structuring solutions, editing is effective for making targeted corrections, while both are useful for learning. These findings highlight the role of manual editing as a deliberate last-mile repair strategy, complementing prompting in AI-assisted programming workflows."
2509.14189,"Peer review remains the central quality-control mechanism of science, yet its ability to fulfill this role is increasingly strained. Empirical studies document serious shortcomings: long publication delays, escalating reviewer burden concentrated on a small minority of scholars, inconsistent quality and low inter-reviewer agreement, and systematic biases by gender, language, and institutional prestige. Decades of human-centered reforms have yielded only marginal improvements. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence, especially large language models (LLMs), is being piloted across the peer-review pipeline by journals, funders, and individual reviewers. Early studies suggest that AI assistance can produce reviews comparable in quality to humans, accelerate reviewer selection and feedback, and reduce certain biases, but also raise distinctive concerns about hallucination, confidentiality, gaming, novelty recognition, and loss of trust. In this paper, we map the aims and persistent failure modes of peer review to specific LLM applications and systematically analyze the objections they raise alongside safeguards that could make their use acceptable. Drawing on emerging evidence, we show that targeted, supervised LLM assistance can plausibly improve error detection, timeliness, and reviewer workload without displacing human judgment. We highlight advanced architectures, including fine-tuned, retrieval-augmented, and multi-agent systems, that may enable more reliable, auditable, and interdisciplinary review. We argue that ethical and practical considerations are not peripheral but constitutive: the legitimacy of AI-assisted peer review depends on governance choices as much as technical capacity. The path forward is neither uncritical adoption nor reflexive rejection, but carefully scoped pilots with explicit evaluation metrics, transparency, and accountability."
2509.14508,"The digital economy implements complex incentive systems to retain users through point redemption. Understanding user behavior in such complex incentive structures presents a fundamental challenge, especially in estimating the value of these digital assets against traditional money. This study tackles this question by analyzing large-scale, real-world transaction data from a popular personal finance application that captures both monetary spending and point-based transactions across Japan's deeply integrated loyalty networks. We find that point usage is not random but is systematically linked to demographics, with older users tending to convert points into financial assets. Furthermore, our analysis using a natural experiment and a causal inference technique reveals that a large point grant stimulated an increase in point spending without affecting cash expenditure. We also find that consumers' shopping styles are associated with their point redemption patterns. This study, conducted within a massive real-world economic ecosystem, examines how consumers navigate multi-currency environments, with direct implications for modeling economic behavior and designing digital platforms."
2509.14532,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transitioned from a futuristic concept reserved for large corporations to a present-day, accessible, and essential growth lever for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). For entrepreneurs and business leaders, strategic AI adoption is no longer an option but an imperative for competitiveness, operational efficiency, and long-term survival. This report provides a comprehensive framework for SME leaders to navigate this technological shift, offering the foundational knowledge, business case, practical applications, and strategic guidance necessary to harness the power of AI. The quantitative evidence supporting AI adoption is compelling; 91% of SMEs using AI report that it directly boosts their revenue. Beyond top-line growth, AI drives profound operational efficiencies, with studies showing it can reduce operational costs by up to 30% and save businesses more than 20 hours of valuable time each month. This transformation is occurring within the context of a seismic economic shift; the global AI market is projected to surge from $233.46 Billion in 2024 to an astonishing $1.77 Trillion by 2032. This paper demystifies the core concepts of AI, presents a business case based on market data, details practical applications, and lays out a phased, actionable adoption strategy."
2509.14554,"The rise of generative large language models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities for automating knowledge representation through concept maps, a long-standing pedagogical tool valued for fostering meaningful learning and higher-order thinking. Traditional construction of concept maps is labor-intensive, requiring significant expertise and time, limiting their scalability in education. This review systematically synthesizes the emerging body of research on LLM-enabled concept map generation, focusing on two guiding questions: (a) What methods and technical features of LLMs are employed to construct concept maps? (b) What empirical evidence exists to validate their educational utility? Through a comprehensive search across major databases and AI-in-education conference proceedings, 28 studies meeting rigorous inclusion criteria were analyzed using thematic synthesis. Findings reveal six major methodological categories: human-in-the-loop systems, weakly supervised learning models, fine-tuned domain-specific LLMs, pre-trained LLMs with prompt engineering, hybrid systems integrating knowledge bases, and modular frameworks combining symbolic and statistical tools. Validation strategies ranged from quantitative metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, semantic similarity) to qualitative evaluations (expert review, learner feedback). Results indicate LLM-generated maps hold promise for scalable, adaptive, and pedagogically relevant knowledge visualization, though challenges remain regarding validity, interpretability, multilingual adaptability, and classroom integration. Future research should prioritize interdisciplinary co-design, empirical classroom trials, and alignment with instructional practices to realize their full educational potential."
2509.14803,"In online learning environments, students often lack personalized peer interactions, which play a crucial role in supporting cognitive development and learning engagement. Although previous studies have utilized large language models (LLMs) to simulate interactive dynamic learning environments for students, these interactions remain limited to conversational exchanges, lacking insights and adaptations to the learners' individualized learning and cognitive states. As a result, students' interest in discussions with AI learning companions is low, and they struggle to gain inspiration from such interactions. To address this challenge, we propose OnlineMate, a multi-agent learning companion system driven by LLMs that integrates the Theory of Mind (ToM). OnlineMate is capable of simulating peer-like agent roles, adapting to learners' cognitive states during collaborative discussions, and inferring their psychological states, such as misunderstandings, confusion, or motivation. By incorporating Theory of Mind capabilities, the system can dynamically adjust its interaction strategies to support the development of higher-order thinking and cognition. Experimental results in simulated learning scenarios demonstrate that OnlineMate effectively fosters deep learning and discussions while enhancing cognitive engagement in online educational settings."
2509.14907,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used for generating digital assets, such as programming codes and images. Games composed of various digital assets are thus expected to be influenced significantly by AI. Leveraging public data and AI disclosure statements of games, this paper shows that relatively more independent developers entered the market when generative AI became more publicly accessible, but their purposes of using AI are similar with non-independent developers. Game features associated with AI hint nuanced impacts of AI on independent developers."
2509.15122,"Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly integral, though largely informal, role in scholarly peer review. Yet it remains unclear whether LLMs reproduce the biases observed in human decision-making. We adapt a resume-style audit to scientific publishing, developing a multi-role LLM simulation (editor/reviewer) that evaluates a representative set of high-quality manuscripts across the physical, biological, and social sciences under randomized author identities (institutional prestige, gender, race). The audit reveals a strong and consistent institutional-prestige bias: identical papers attributed to low-prestige affiliations face a significantly higher risk of rejection, despite only modest differences in LLM-assessed quality. To probe mechanisms, we generate synthetic CVs for the same author profiles; these encode large prestige-linked disparities and an inverted prestige-tenure gradient relative to national benchmarks. The results suggest that both domain norms and prestige-linked priors embedded in training data shape paper-level outcomes once identity is visible, converting affiliation into a decisive status cue."
2509.15132,"This paper shows how a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can expand urban measurement capacity and support tracking of place-based policy interventions. Using a structured, reason-then-estimate pipeline on street-view imagery, GPT-4o infers neighborhood poverty and tree canopy, which we embed in a quasi-experimental design evaluating the legacy of 1930s redlining. GPT-4o recovers the expected adverse socio-environmental legacy effects of redlining, with estimates statistically indistinguishable from authoritative sources, and it outperforms a conventional pixel-based segmentation baseline-consistent with the idea that holistic scene reasoning extracts higher-order information beyond object counts alone. These results position MLLMs as policy-grade instruments for neighborhood measurement and motivate broader validation across policy-evaluation settings."
2509.15545,"The metaverse offers immersive and adaptive learning environments for neurodivergent students to thrive and reach their full potential. In this paper, we propose a generic framework that leverages metaverse services as an evolution beyond traditional service-oriented computing, enabling more interactive, personalized, and engaging educational experiences. By integrating AI-driven adaptability, multimodal interaction, and privacy-first service design, the framework ensures that learning remains accessible, inclusive, and secure. Additionally, we explore the challenges associated with scalability, data privacy, and ethical considerations while highlighting opportunities for fostering safe and student-centered virtual spaces. Our analysis underscores the potential of metaverse-based learning to bridge accessibility gaps, support social-emotional development, and empower neurodivergent learners in both digital and real-world settings. We also provide recommendations and policy considerations for creating a secure, inclusive, and scalable metaverse learn-ing ecosystem for neurodivergent students."
2509.15657,"Understanding how built environments shape human experience is central to designing sustainable cities. Cycling provides a critical case: it delivers health and environmental benefits, yet its uptake depends strongly on the experience of cycling rather than infrastructure alone. Research on this relationship has grown rapidly but remains fragmented across disciplines and scales, and has concentrated on network-level analyses of routes and connectivity. This bias is especially problematic in historical cities, where embedding new infrastructure is difficult, and where cycling experience is shaped not only by spatial form but also by how cyclists perceive, interpret, and physically respond to their environment - through psychological factors such as safety and comfort, physiological demands such as stress and fatigue, and perceptual cues in the streetscape. We systematically reviewed 68 studies across urban planning, transportation, behavioural science, neuroscience, and public health. Two scales of analysis were identified: a macro scale addressing the ability to cycle and a micro scale addressing the propensity to cycle. Methods were classified into objective and subjective approaches, with hybrid approaches beginning to emerge. We find a persistent reliance on objective proxies, limited integration of subjective accounts, and insufficient attention to the streetscape as a lived environment. Addressing these gaps is essential to explain why environments enable or deter cycling, and to inform the design of cities that support cycling as both mobility and lived experience."
2509.16218,"This paper introduces a unified and automated framework designed to dynamically assess the impact of electric vehicle (EV) charging on distribution feeders and transformers at California State University, Northridge (CSUN). As EV adoption accelerates, the resulting increase in charging demand imposes additional stress on local power distribution systems. Moreover, the evolving nature of EV load profiles throughout the day necessitates detailed temporal analysis to identify peak loading conditions, anticipate worst-case scenarios, and plan timely infrastructure upgrades. Our main contribution is the development of a flexible testbed that integrates Julia, a high-performance programming language for technical computing, with PowerWorld Simulator via thethis http URLpackage. This integration enables seamless modeling, simulation, and analysis of EV charging load profiles and their implications for campus grid infrastructure. The framework leverages a real-world dataset collected from CSUN's EV charging stations, consisting of 15-minute interval measurements over the course of one year. By coupling high-resolution data with dynamic simulations, the proposed system offers a valuable tool for evaluating transformer loading, feeder utilization, and overall system stress. The results support data-driven decision-making for EV infrastructure deployment, load forecasting, and energy management strategies. In addition, the framework allows for scenario-based studies to explore the impact of future increases in EV penetration or changes in charging behavior. Its modular architecture also makes it adaptable to other campus or urban distribution systems facing similar electrification challenges."
2509.16224,"Preventing student dropout is a major challenge in higher education and it is difficult to predict prior to enrolment which students are likely to drop out and which students are likely to succeed. High School GPA is a strong predictor of dropout, but much variance in dropout remains to be explained. This study focused on predicting university dropout by using text mining techniques with the aim of exhuming information contained in motivation statements written by students. By combining text data with classic predictors of dropout in the form of student characteristics, we attempt to enhance the available set of predictive student characteristics. Our dataset consisted of 7,060 motivation statements of students enrolling in a non-selective bachelor at a Dutch university in 2014 and 2015. Support Vector Machines were trained on 75 percent of the data and several models were estimated on the test data. We used various combinations of student characteristics and text, such as TFiDF, topic modelling, LIWC dictionary. Results showed that, although the combination of text and student characteristics did not improve the prediction of dropout, text analysis alone predicted dropout similarly well as a set of student characteristics. Suggestions for future research are provided."
2509.16249,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises new opportunities across many domains, including agriculture. However, the adoption of AI systems in this sector faces several challenges. System complexity can impede trust, as farmers' livelihoods depend on their decision-making and they may reject opaque or hard-to-understand recommendations. Data privacy concerns also pose a barrier, especially when farmers lack transparency regarding who can access their data and for what purposes.This paper examines dairy farmers' explainability requirements for technical recommendations and data privacy, along with the influence of socio-demographic factors. Based on a mixed-methods study involving 40 German dairy farmers, we identify five user personas through k-means clustering. Our findings reveal varying requirements, with some farmers preferring little detail while others seek full transparency across different aspects. Age, technology experience, and confidence in using digital systems were found to correlate with these explainability requirements. The resulting user personas offer practical guidance for requirements engineers aiming to tailor digital systems more effectively to the diverse requirements of farmers."
2509.16259,"In the digital twin and building information era, many building automation companies searched for scalable methods to extract and analyze different building data, including Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, actuators, layout sections, zones, etc. The necessity for engineers to continuously manage the entire process for each new building creates scalability challenges. Furthermore, because construction information is sensitive, transferring data on vendor platforms via the cloud creates problems. This paper introduces a platform designed to address some of the common challenges in building automation. This is a smart platform designed for the transformation of building information into Brick ontology (Brick 2020) and graph formats. This technology makes it easy to retrieve historical data and converts the building point list into a Brick schema model for use in digital twin applications. The overarching goal of the proposed platform development is semi-automate the process while offering adaptability to various building configurations. This platform uses Brick schema and graph data structure techniques to minimize complexity, offering a semi-automated approach through its use of a tree-based graph structure. Moreover, the integration of Brick ontology creates a common language for interoperability and improves building information management. The seamless and offline integration of historical data within the developed platform minimizes data security risks when handling building information."
2509.1626,"Digitalization is a crucial characteristic of the current era, and green innovation has become one of the necessary pathways for enterprises to achieve sustainable development. Based on financial and annual report data of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2019, this paper constructs indicators of corporate digital transformation and examines the impact of corporate digital transformation on green innovation and its underlying mechanisms. The results show that corporate digital transformation can promote corporate green innovation output, with its sustained future impact exhibiting a marginally decreasing trend. In terms of the impact mechanism, digital transformation can enhance corporate green innovation output by increasing corporate R&D investment and strengthening environmental management. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that digital transformation has a more pronounced promoting effect on green innovation output for small and medium-sized enterprises and those in technology-intensive industries. To improve the green innovation incentive effect of digital transformation, enterprises should formulate long-term strategies and continuously strengthen policy regulation and incentives."
2509.16262,"This study examines the impact of Socratic Mind, a Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) powered formative assessment tool that employs Socratic questioning to support student learning in a large, fully online undergraduate-level computing course. Employing a quasi-experimental, mixed-methods design, we investigated participants' engagement patterns, the influence of user experience on engagement, and impacts on both perceived and actual learning outcomes. Data were collected from the system logs, surveys on user experience and perceived engagement and learning gains, student reflections, and course performance data. Results indicated that participants consistently reported high levels of affective, behavioral, and cognitive engagement, and these were strongly linked to positive user experiences and perceived learning outcomes. Quantitative analysis further revealed that students who engaged with the GenAI tool experienced significant gains in their quiz scores compared to those who did not, particularly benefiting students with lower baseline achievement. Additionally, thematic analysis of qualitative feedback revealed substantial perceived improvements in higher-order thinking skills, including problem solving, critical thinking, and self-reflection. Our findings highlight the promise of AI-mediated dialogue in fostering deeper engagement and higher-order cognitive skills. As higher education institutions expand GenAI integration in curriculum, this dialogic, GenAI powered assessment tool can offer a scalable strategy to promote students' meaningful learning outcomes."
2509.16276,"There is an increasing imperative to integrate programming platforms within AI frameworks to enhance educational tasks for both teachers and students. However, commonly used platforms such asthis http URL, Scratch, and Snap fall short of providing the desired AI features and lack adaptability for interdisciplinary applications. This study explores how educational platforms can be improved by incorporating AI and analytics features to create more effective learning environments across various subjects and domains. We interviewed 8 K-12 teachers and asked their practices and needs while using any block-based programming (BBP) platform in their classes. We asked for their approaches in assessment, course development and expansion of resources, and student monitoring in their classes. Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts revealed both commonalities and differences in the AI tools needed between the STEM and non-STEM groups. Our results indicated advanced AI features that could promote BBP platforms. Both groups stressed the need for integrity and plagiarism checks, AI adaptability, customized rubrics, and detailed feedback in assessments. Non-STEM teachers also emphasized the importance of creative assignments and qualitative assessments. Regarding resource development, both AI tools desired for updating curricula, tutoring libraries, and generative AI features. Non-STEM teachers were particularly interested in supporting creative endeavors, such as art simulations. For student monitoring, both groups prioritized desktop control, daily tracking, behavior monitoring, and distraction prevention tools. Our findings identify specific AI-enhanced features needed by K-12 teachers across various disciplines and lay the foundation for creating more efficient, personalized, and engaging educational experiences."
2509.16279,"This study deploys methods in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), e.g. decision trees and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC), to investigate electricity usage in multiple locales. It addresses the vital issue of energy burden, i.e. total amount spent on energy divided by median household income. Socio-demographic data is analyzed with energy features, especially using decision trees and PCC, providing explainable predictors on factors affecting energy burden. Based on the results of the analysis, a pilot energy equity web portal is designed along with a novel energy burden calculator. Leveraging XAI, this portal (with its calculator) serves as a prototype information system that can offer tailored actionable advice to multiple energy stakeholders. The ultimate goal of this study is to promote greater energy equity through the adaptation of XAI methods for energy-related analysis with suitable recommendations."
2509.16286,"This paper presents a multimodal dataset of 1,000 indigenous recipes from remote regions of India, collected through a participatory model involving first-time digital workers from rural areas. The project covers ten endangered language communities in six states. Documented using a dedicated mobile app, the data set includes text, images, and audio, capturing traditional food practices along with their ecological and cultural contexts. This initiative addresses gaps in food computing, such as the lack of culturally inclusive, multimodal, and community-authored data. By documenting food as it is practiced rather than prescribed, this work advances inclusive, ethical, and scalable approaches to AI-driven food systems and opens new directions in cultural AI, public health, and sustainable agriculture."
2509.16291,"Care coordination and population health management programs serve large Medicaid and safety-net populations and must be auditable, efficient, and adaptable. While clinical risk for outreach modalities is typically low, time and opportunity costs differ substantially across text, phone, video, and in-person visits. We propose a lightweight offline reinforcement learning (RL) approach that augments trained policies with (i) test-time learning via local neighborhood calibration, and (ii) inference-time deliberation via a small Q-ensemble that incorporates predictive uncertainty and time/effort cost. The method exposes transparent dials for neighborhood size and uncertainty/cost penalties and preserves an auditable training pipeline. Evaluated on a de-identified operational dataset, TTL+ITD achieves stable value estimates with predictable efficiency trade-offs and subgroup auditing."
2509.16294,"This paper explores how the U.S. Department of Treasury, particularly the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), is adopting artificial intelligence (AI) to modernize tax administration. Using publicly available information, the survey highlights the applications of AI for taxpayer support, operational efficiency, fraud detection, and audit optimization. Key initiatives include AI-powered chatbots, robotic process automation, machine learning for case selection, and advanced analytics for fraud prevention. These technologies aim to reduce errors, improve efficiency, and improve taxpayer experiences. At the same time, the IRS is implementing governance measures to ensure responsible use of AI, including privacy safeguards, transparency initiatives, and oversight mechanisms. The analysis shows that the Treasury AI strategy balances technological innovation with legal compliance, confidentiality, and public trust, reflecting a wider effort to modernize aging systems while maintaining accountability in tax collection and enforcement."
2509.16295,"Open digital public infrastructure needs community management to ensure accountability, sustainability, and robustness. Yet open-source projects often rely on centralized decision-making, and the determinants of successful community management remain unclear. We analyze 637 GitHub repositories to trace transitions from founder-led to shared governance. Specifically, we document trajectories to community governance by extracting institutional roles, actions, and deontic cues from version-controlled project constitutions (this http URL). With a semantic parsing pipeline, we cluster elements into broader role and action types. We find roles and actions grow, and regulation becomes more balanced, reflecting increases in governance scope and differentiation over time. Rather than shifting tone, communities grow by layering and refining responsibilities. As transitions to community management mature, projects increasingly regulate ecosystem-level relationships and add definition to project oversight roles. Overall, this work offers a scalable pipeline for tracking the growth and development of community governance regimes from open-source software's familiar default of founder-ownership."
2509.16297,"Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable fluency across linguistic and reasoning tasks but remain systematically prone to hallucination. Prevailing accounts attribute hallucinations to data gaps, limited context, or optimization errors. We argue instead that hallucination is a structural outcome of the transformer architecture. As coherence engines, transformers are compelled to produce fluent continuations, with self-attention simulating the relational structure of meaning but lacking the existential grounding of temporality, mood, and care that stabilizes human understanding. On this basis, we distinguish ontological hallucination, arising when continuations require disclosure of beings in world, and residual reasoning hallucination, where models mimic inference by recycling traces of human reasoning in text. We illustrate these patterns through case studies aligned with Heideggerian categories and an experiment across twelve LLMs showing how simulated ""self-preservation"" emerges under extended prompts. Our contribution is threefold: (1) a comparative account showing why existing explanations are insufficient; (2) a predictive taxonomy of hallucination linked to existential structures with proposed benchmarks; and (3) design directions toward ""truth-constrained"" architectures capable of withholding or deferring when disclosure is absent. We conclude that hallucination is not an incidental defect but a defining limit of transformer-based models, an outcome scaffolding can mask but never resolve."
2509.16378,"The promise of AI in medicine depends on learning from data that reflect what matters to patients and clinicians. Most existing models are trained on electronic health records (EHRs), which capture biological measures but rarely patient-clinician interactions. These relationships, central to care, unfold across voice, text, and video, yet remain absent from datasets. As a result, AI systems trained solely on EHRs risk perpetuating a narrow biomedical view of medicine and overlooking the lived exchanges that define clinical encounters. Our objective is to design, implement, and evaluate the feasibility of a longitudinal, multimodal system for capturing patient-clinician encounters, linking 360 degree video/audio recordings with surveys and EHR data to create a dataset for AI research. This single site study is in an academic outpatient endocrinology clinic at Mayo Clinic. Adult patients with in-person visits to participating clinicians are invited to enroll. Encounters are recorded with a 360 degree video camera. After each visit, patients complete a survey on empathy, satisfaction, pace, and treatment burden. Demographic and clinical data are extracted from the EHR. Feasibility is assessed using five endpoints: clinician consent, patient consent, recording success, survey completion, and data linkage across modalities. Recruitment began in January 2025. By August 2025, 35 of 36 eligible clinicians (97%) and 212 of 281 approached patients (75%) had consented. Of consented encounters, 162 (76%) had complete recordings and 204 (96%) completed the survey. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a replicable framework for capturing the multimodal dynamics of patient-clinician encounters. By detailing workflows, endpoints, and ethical safeguards, it provides a template for longitudinal datasets and lays the foundation for AI models that incorporate the complexity of care."
2509.16473,"How humans interpret and produce images is influenced by the images we have been exposed to. Similarly, visual generative AI models are exposed to many training images and learn to generate new images based on this. Given the importance of iconic images in human visual communication, as they are widely seen, reproduced, and used as inspiration, we may expect that they may similarly have a proportionally large influence within the generative AI process. In this work we explore this question through a three-part analysis, involving data attribution, semantic similarity analysis, and a user-study. Our findings indicate that iconic images do not have an obvious influence on the generative process, and that for many icons it is challenging to reproduce an image which resembles it closely. This highlights an important difference in how humans and visual generative AI models draw on and learn from prior visual communication."
2509.16724,"This research examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve participatory budgeting processes within smart cities. In response to challenges like declining civic participation and resource allocation conflicts, the study explores how online political participation can be improved by AI. It investigates the state capacity governments need to implement AI-enhanced participatory tools, considering technological dependencies and vulnerabilities. It analyzes technological and administrative structures, actors, interests, and strategies to understand the dynamics of online political participation technologies in the case of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The study contributes to understanding how technological advancements can reshape participatory budgeting processes. In a broader sense, the research highlights how AI can transform participatory institutions by offering new tools for citizens and also for government officials in charge of participatory processes within smart cities."
2509.16794,"The exploding use and impact of Chatbots such as ChatGPT that are based on Large Language Models urgently call for a language which is fit to clearly describe functions and problems of the production process and qualities of the Chatbots' textual and image output. Recently, the discussion about appropriate and illuminating metaphors to describe LLMs has gained momentum. As an alternative to well-established metaphors such as ""hallucinating"" and ""bullshit"", we propose ""kitsch"" as a new metaphor. As an internationally widespread term from literary and cultural studies, we argue that ""kitsch"" is particularly suitable for analytically illuminating a previously neglected feature of LLM-based images and texts: their tendency to produce homogeneous and average content, which is becoming increasingly dominant as the proportion of AI-generated content on the internet grows. This is leading to the equalisation of language, style and argument. In view of the potential negative consequences of this averaging, including for human content producers on the internet, we advocate combining methods and insights from kitsch studies with AI research, philosophy, and communication studies in order to better understand the phenomenon and develop countermeasures."
2509.16925,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to reshape academic publishing by enabling the rapid production of submission-ready manuscripts. While such tools promise to enhance productivity, they also raise concerns about overwhelming journal systems that have fixed acceptance capacities. This paper uses simulation modeling to investigate how AI-driven surges in submissions may affect desk rejection rates, review cycles, and faculty publication portfolios, with a focus on business school journals and tenure processes. Three scenarios are analyzed: a baseline model, an Early Adopter model where a subset of faculty boosts productivity, and an AI Abuse model where submissions rise exponentially. Results indicate that early adopters initially benefit, but overall acceptance rates fall sharply as load increases, with tenure-track faculty facing disproportionately negative outcomes. The study contributes by demonstrating the structural vulnerabilities of the current publication system and highlights the need for institutional reform in personnel evaluation and research dissemination practices."
2509.1713,"The vast majority of US public school districts use school attendance boundaries to determine which student addresses are assigned to which schools. Existing work shows how redrawing boundaries can be a powerful policy lever for increasing access and opportunity for historically disadvantaged groups, even while maintaining other priorities like minimizing driving distances and preserving existing social ties between students and families. This study introduces a multi-objective algorithmic school rezoning framework and applies it to a large-scale rezoning effort impacting over 50,000 students through an ongoing researcher-school district partnership. The framework is designed to incorporate feedback from community members and policymakers, both by deciding which goals are optimized and also by placing differential ``importance'' on goals through weights from community surveys. Empirical results reveal the framework's ability to surface school redistricting plans that simultaneously advance a number of objectives often thought to be in competition with one another, including socioeconomic integration, transportation efficiency, and stable feeder patterns (transitions) between elementary, middle, and high schools. The paper also highlights how local education policymakers navigate several practical challenges, like building political will to make change in a polarized policy climate. The framework is built using open-source tools and publicly released to support school districts in exploring and implementing new policies to improve educational access and opportunity in the coming years."
2509.17334,"Explainability, the capability of an artificial intelligence system (AIS) to explain its outcomes in a manner that is comprehensible to human beings at an acceptable level, has been deemed essential for critical sectors, such as healthcare. Is it really the case? In this perspective, we consider two extreme cases, ``Oracle'' (without explainability) versus ``AI Colleague'' (with explainability) for a thorough analysis. We discuss how the level of automation and explainability of AIS can affect the determination of liability among the medical practitioner/facility and manufacturer of AIS. We argue that explainability plays a crucial role in setting a responsibility framework in healthcare, from a legal standpoint, to shape the behavior of all involved parties and mitigate the risk of potential defensive medicine practices."
2509.17727,"Mainstream AI ethics, with its reliance on top-down, principle-driven frameworks, fails to account for the situated realities of diverse communities affected by AI (Artificial Intelligence). Critics have argued that AI ethics frequently serves corporate interests through practices of 'ethics washing', operating more as a tool for public relations than as a means of preventing harm or advancing the common good. As a result, growing scepticism among critical scholars has cast the field as complicit in sustaining harmful systems rather than challenging or transforming them. In response, this paper adopts a Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspective to critically interrogate the field of AI ethics. It hence applies the same analytic tools STS has long directed at disciplines such as biology, medicine, and statistics to ethics. This perspective reveals a core tension between vertical (top-down, principle-based) and horizontal (risk-mitigating, implementation-oriented) approaches to ethics. By tracing how these models have shaped the discourse, we show how both fall short in addressing the complexities of AI as a socio-technical assemblage, embedded in practice and entangled with power. To move beyond these limitations, we propose a threefold reorientation of AI ethics. First, we call for a shift in foundations: from top-down abstraction to empirical grounding. Second, we advocate for pluralisation: moving beyond Western-centric frameworks toward a multiplicity of onto-epistemic perspectives. Finally, we outline strategies for reconfiguring AI ethics as a transformative force, moving from narrow paradigms of risk mitigation toward co-creating technologies of hope."
2509.17878,"As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in digital, social, and institutional infrastructures, and AI and platforms are merged into hybrid structures, systemic risk has emerged as a critical but undertheorized challenge. In this paper, we develop a rigorous framework for understanding systemic risk in AI, platform, and hybrid system governance, drawing on insights from finance, complex systems theory, climate change, and cybersecurity - domains where systemic risk has already shaped regulatory responses. We argue that recent legislation, including the EU's AI Act and Digital Services Act (DSA), invokes systemic risk but relies on narrow or ambiguous characterizations of this notion, sometimes reducing this risk to specific capabilities present in frontier AI models, or to harms occurring in economic market settings. The DSA, we show, actually does a better job at identifying systemic risk than the more recent AI Act. Our framework highlights novel risk pathways, including the possibility of systemic failures arising from the interaction of multiple AI agents. We identify four levels of AI-related systemic risk and emphasize that discrimination at scale and systematic hallucinations, despite their capacity to destabilize institutions and fundamental rights, may not fall under current legal definitions, given the AI Act's focus on frontier model capabilities. We then test the DSA, the AI Act, and our own framework on five key examples, and propose reforms that broaden systemic risk assessments, strengthen coordination between regulatory regimes, and explicitly incorporate collective harms."
2509.17999,"Modern foundational models increasingly reflect not just world knowledge, but patterns of human preference embedded in their training data. We hypothesize that recursive alignment-via human feedback and model-generated corpora-induces a social desirability bias, nudging models to favor agreeable or flattering responses over objective reasoning. We refer to it as the Narcissus Hypothesis and test it across 31 models using standardized personality assessments and a novel Social Desirability Bias score. Results reveal a significant drift toward socially conforming traits, with profound implications for corpus integrity and the reliability of downstream inferences. We then offer a novel epistemological interpretation, tracing how recursive bias may collapse higher-order reasoning down Pearl's Ladder of Causality, culminating in what we refer to as the Rung of Illusion."
2509.18079,"This paper critically analyzes the discourse of the 'AI executive elite,' a group of highly influential individuals shaping the way AI is funded, developed, and deployed worldwide. The primary objective is to examine the presence and dynamics of the 'Techno-Supremacy Doctrine' (TSD), a term introduced in this study to describe a belief system characterized by an excessive trust in technology's alleged inherent superiority in solving complex societal problems. This study integrates quantitative heuristics with in-depth qualitative investigations. Its methodology is operationalized in a two-phase critical discourse analysis of 14 texts published by elite members between 2017 and 2025. The findings demonstrate that the elite is not a monolithic bloc but exhibits a broad spectrum of stances. The discourse is highly dynamic, showing a marked polarization and general increase in pro-TSD discourse following the launch of ChatGPT. The analysis identifies key discursive patterns, including a dominant pro-TSD narrative that combines utopian promises with claims of inevitable progress, and the common tactic of acknowledging risks only as a strategic preamble to proposing further technological solutions. This paper presents TSD as a comprehensive analytical framework and provides a 'diagnostic toolkit' for identifying its manifestations, from insidious to benign. It argues that fostering critical awareness of these discursive patterns is essential for AI practitioners, policymakers, and the public to actively navigate the future of AI."
2509.18157,"Learning Progressions (LPs) can help adjust instruction to individual learners needs if the LPs reflect diverse ways of thinking about a construct being measured, and if the LP-aligned assessments meaningfully measure this diversity. The process of doing science is inherently multi-modal with scientists utilizing drawings, writing and other modalities to explain phenomena. Thus, fostering deep science understanding requires supporting students in using multiple modalities when explaining phenomena. We build on a validated NGSS-aligned multi-modal LP reflecting diverse ways of modeling and explaining electrostatic phenomena and associated assessments. We focus on students modeling, an essential practice for building a deep science understanding. Supporting culturally and linguistically diverse students in building modeling skills provides them with an alternative mode of communicating their understanding, essential for equitable science assessment. Machine learning (ML) has been used to score open-ended modeling tasks (e.g., drawings), and short text-based constructed scientific explanations, both of which are time-consuming to score. We use ML to evaluate LP-aligned scientific models and the accompanying short text-based explanations reflecting multi-modal understanding of electrical interactions in high school Physical Science. We show how LP guides the design of personalized ML-driven feedback grounded in the diversity of student thinking on both assessment modes."
2509.18194,"In 1990, Gilles Deleuze published Postscript on the Societies of Control, an introduction to the potentially suffocating reality of the nascent control society. This thirty-year update details how Deleuze's conception has developed from a broad speculative vision into specific economic mechanisms clustering around personal information, big data, predictive analytics, and marketing. The central claim is that today's advancing control society coerces without prohibitions, and through incentives that are not grim but enjoyable, even euphoric because they compel individuals to obey their own personal information. The article concludes by delineating two strategies for living that are as unexplored as control society itself because they are revealed and then enabled by the particular method of oppression that is control."
2509.18195,"This article provides a necessary corrective to the belief that current legal and political concepts and institutions are capable of holding to account the power of new AI technologies. Drawing on jurisprudential analysis, it argues that while the current development of AI is dependent on the combination of economic and legal power, the technological forms that result increasingly exceed the capacity of even the most rigorous legal and political regimes. A situation of ""a-legality"" is emerging whereby the potential of AI to produce harms cannot be restrained by conventional legal or political institutions."
2509.1821,"Dark patterns are (evil) design nudges that steer people's behaviour through persuasive interface design. Increasingly found in cookie consent requests, they possibly undermine principles of EU privacy law. In two preregistered online experiments we investigated the effects of three common design nudges (default, aesthetic manipulation, obstruction) on users' consent decisions and their perception of control over their personal data in these situations. In the first experiment (N = 228) we explored the effects of design nudges towards the privacy-unfriendly option (dark patterns). The experiment revealed that most participants agreed to all consent requests regardless of dark design nudges. Unexpectedly, despite generally low levels of perceived control, obstructing the privacy-friendly option led to more rather than less perceived control. In the second experiment (N = 255) we reversed the direction of the design nudges towards the privacy-friendly option, which we title ""bright patterns"". This time the obstruction and default nudges swayed people effectively towards the privacy-friendly option, while the result regarding perceived control stayed the same compared to Experiment 1. Overall, our findings suggest that many current implementations of cookie consent requests do not enable meaningful choices by internet users, and are thus not in line with the intention of the EU policymakers. We also explore how policymakers could address the problem."
2509.18211,"This article discusses a problem that has received scant attention in literature: microtargeted propaganda by foreign actors. Microtargeting involves collecting information about people, and using that information to show them targeted political advertisements. Such microtargeting enables advertisers to target ads to specific groups of people, for instance people who visit certain websites, forums, or Facebook groups. This article focuses on one type of microtargeting: microtargeting by foreign actors. For example, Russia has targeted certain groups in the US with ads, aiming to sow discord. Foreign actors could also try to influence European elections, for instance by advertising in favour of a certain political party. Foreign propaganda possibilities existed before microtargeting. This article explores two questions. In what ways, if any, is microtargeted propaganda by foreign actors different from other foreign propaganda? What could lawmakers in Europe do to mitigate the risks of microtargeted propaganda?"
2509.18212,"An online seller or platform is technically able to offer every consumer a different price for the same product, based on information it has about the customers. Such online price discrimination exacerbates concerns regarding the fairness and morality of price discrimination, and the possible need for regulation. In this chapter, we discuss the underlying basis of price discrimination in economic theory, and its popular perception. Our surveys show that consumers are critical and suspicious of online price discrimination. A majority consider it unacceptable and unfair, and are in favour of a ban. When stores apply online price discrimination, most consumers think they should be informed about it. We argue that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to the most controversial forms of online price discrimination, and not only requires companies to disclose their use of price discrimination, but also requires companies to ask customers for their prior consent. Industry practice, however, does not show any adoption of these two principles."
2509.18231,"Knowledge Tracing (KT) plays a central role in assessing students skill mastery and predicting their future performance. While deep learning based KT models achieve superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional methods, their complexity and opacity hinder their ability to provide psychologically meaningful explanations. This disconnect between model parameters and cognitive theory poses challenges for understanding and enhancing the learning process, limiting their trustworthiness in educational applications. To address these challenges, we enhance interpretable KT models by exploring human-understandable features derived from students interaction data. By incorporating additional features, particularly those reflecting students learning abilities, our enhanced approach improves predictive accuracy while maintaining alignment with cognitive theory. Our contributions aim to balance predictive power with interpretability, advancing the utility of adaptive learning systems."
2509.18233,"This paper offers a domain-mediated comparative review of 251 studies on public attitudes toward AI, published between 2011 and 2025. Drawing on a systematic literature review, we analyse how different factors including perceived benefits and concerns (or risks) shape public acceptance of - or resistance to - artificial intelligence across domains and use-cases, including healthcare, education, security, public administration, generative AI, and autonomous vehicles. The analysis highlights recurring patterns in individual, contextual, and technical factors influencing perception, while also tracing variations in institutional trust, perceived fairness, and ethical concerns. We show that the public perception in AI is shaped not only by technical design or performance but also by sector-specific considerations as well as imaginaries, cultural narratives, and historical legacies. This comparative approach offers a foundation for developing more tailored and context-sensitive strategies for responsible AI governance."
2509.18394,"Artificial intelligence risks are multidimensional in nature, as the same risk scenarios may have legal, operational, and financial risk dimensions. With the emergence of new AI regulations, the state of the art of artificial intelligence risk management seems to be highly immature due to upcoming AI regulations. Despite the appearance of several methodologies and generic criteria, it is rare to find guidelines with real implementation value, considering that the most important issue is customizing artificial intelligence risk metrics and risk models for specific AI risk scenarios. Furthermore, the financial departments, legal departments and Government Risk Compliance teams seem to remain unaware of many technical aspects of AI systems, in which data scientists and AI engineers emerge as the most appropriate implementers. It is crucial to decompose the problem of artificial intelligence risk in several dimensions: data protection, fairness, accuracy, robustness, and information security. Consequently, the main task is developing adequate metrics and risk models that manage to reduce uncertainty for decision-making in order to take informed decisions concerning the risk management of AI systems.The purpose of this paper is to orientate AI stakeholders about the depths of AI risk management. Although it is not extremely technical, it requires a basic knowledge of risk management, quantifying uncertainty, the FAIR model, machine learning, large language models and AI context engineering. The examples presented pretend to be very basic and understandable, providing simple ideas that can be developed regarding specific AI customized environments. There are many issues to solve in AI risk management, and this paper will present a holistic overview of the inter-dependencies of AI risks, and how to model them together, within risk scenarios."
2509.18446,"The 2024 US presidential election is the first major contest to occur in the US since the popularization of large language models (LLMs). Building on lessons from earlier shifts in media (most notably social media's well studied role in targeted messaging and political polarization) this moment raises urgent questions about how LLMs may shape the information ecosystem and influence political discourse. While platforms have announced some election safeguards, how well they work in practice remains unclear. Against this backdrop, we conduct a large-scale, longitudinal study of 12 models, queried using a structured survey with over 12,000 questions on a near-daily cadence from July through November 2024. Our design systematically varies content and format, resulting in a rich dataset that enables analyses of the models' behavior over time (e.g., across model updates), sensitivity to steering, responsiveness to instructions, and election-related knowledge and ""beliefs."" In the latter half of our work, we perform four analyses of the dataset that (i) study the longitudinal variation of model behavior during election season, (ii) illustrate the sensitivity of election-related responses to demographic steering, (iii) interrogate the models' beliefs about candidates' attributes, and (iv) reveal the models' implicit predictions of the election outcome. To facilitate future evaluations of LLMs in electoral contexts, we detail our methodology, from question generation to the querying pipeline and third-party tooling. We also publicly release our dataset atthis https URL"
2509.18509,"The underrepresentation of First Peoples in computing education reflects colonial legacies embedded in curricula, pedagogies, and digital infrastructures. This paper introduces the \textbf{Decolonial Mindset Stack (DMS)}, a seven-layer framework for educator transformation: \textbf{Recognition, Reflection, Reframing, Reembedding, Reciprocity, Reclamation}, and \textbf{Resurgence}. Grounded in Freirean critical pedagogy and Indigenous methodologies, the DMS aligns with relational lenses of ``About Me,'' ``Between Us,'' and ``By Us.'' It fosters self-reflexivity, relational accountability, and Indigenous sovereignty in computing education, reframing underrepresentation as systemic exclusion. The DMS provides both theoretical grounding and pathways for practice, positioning indigenisation not as an endpoint but as a sustained ethical commitment to transformative justice and the co-creation of computing education with First Peoples."
2509.18523,"Inconsistencies are ubiquitous in law, administration, and jurisprudence. Though a cure is too much to hope for, we propose a technological remedy. Large language models (LLMs) can accurately extract propositions from arguments and compile them into natural data structures that enable coherence-driven inference (CDI) via combinatorial optimization. This neurosymbolic architecture naturally separates concerns and enables meaningful judgments about the coherence of arguments that can inform legislative and policy analysis and legal reasoning."
2509.18605,"This paper uses Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to show how Sino-judicial activism shapes Data Intellectual Property Rights (DIPR) in China. We identify two complementary judicial discourses. Local courts (exemplified by the Zhejiang High People's Court, HCZJ) use a judicial continuation discourse that extends intellectual property norms to data disputes. The Supreme People's Court (SPC) deploys a judicial linkage discourse that aligns adjudication with state policy and administrative governance. Their interaction forms a bidirectional conceptual coupling (BCC): an inside-out projection of local reasoning and an outside-in translation of policy into doctrine. The coupling both legitimizes and constrains courts and policymakers, balancing pressure for unified market standards with safeguards against platform monopolization. Through cases such as HCZJ's Taobao v. Meijing and the SPC's Anti-Unfair Competition Interpretation, the study presents DIPR as a testbed for doctrinal innovation and institutional coordination in China's evolving digital governance."
2509.18768,"Growing attention is given to the environmental impacts of the digital sector, exacerbated by the increase of digital products and services in our globalized societies. The materiality of the digital sector is often presented through the environmental impacts of mining activities to point out that digitization does not mean dematerialization. Despite its importance, such a narrative is often restricted to a few minerals (e.g., cobalt, lithium) that have become the symbols of extractive industries. In this paper, we further explore the materiality of the digital sector with an approach based on the diversity of elements and their purity requirements in the semiconductor industry. Semiconductors are responsible for manufacturing the key building blocks of the digital sector, i.e., microchips. Given that the need for ultra-high purity materials is very specific to the semiconductor industry, a few companies around the world have been studied, revealing new critical actors in complex supply chains. This highlights strong dependencies towards other industrial sectors with mass production and the need for a deeper investigation of interactions with the chemical industry, complementary to the mining industry."
2509.189,"The integrative literature review addresses the conceptualization and implementation of AI Literacy (AIL) in Higher Education (HE) by examining recent research literature. Through an analysis of publications (2021-2024), we explore (1) how AIL is defined and conceptualized in current research, particularly in HE, and how it can be delineated from related concepts such as Data Literacy, Media Literacy, and Computational Literacy; (2) how various definitions can be synthesized into a comprehensive working definition, and (3) how scientific insights can be effectively translated into educational practice. Our analysis identifies seven central dimensions of AIL: technical, applicational, critical thinking, ethical, social, integrational, and legal. These are synthesized in the AI Literacy Heptagon, deepening conceptual understanding and supporting the structured development of AIL in HE. The study aims to bridge the gap between theoretical AIL conceptualizations and the practical implementation in academic curricula."
2509.19088,"Digital representations of individuals (""digital twins"") promise to transform social science and decision-making. Yet it remains unclear whether such twins truly mirror the people they emulate. We conducted 19 preregistered studies with a representative U.S. panel and their digital twins, each constructed from rich individual-level data, enabling direct comparisons between human and twin behavior across a wide range of domains and stimuli (including never-seen-before ones). Twins reproduced individual responses with 75% accuracy and seemingly low correlation with human answers (approximately 0.2). However, this apparently high accuracy was no higher than that achieved by generic personas based on demographics only. In contrast, correlation improved when twins incorporated detailed personal information, even outperforming traditional machine learning benchmarks that require additional data. Twins exhibited systematic strengths and weaknesses - performing better in social and personality domains, but worse in political ones - and were more accurate for participants with higher education, higher income, and moderate political views and religious attendance. Together, these findings delineate both the promise and the current limits of digital twins: they capture some relative differences among individuals but not yet the unique judgments of specific people. All data and code are publicly available to support the further development and evaluation of digital twin pipelines."
2509.19147,"Generative propaganda is the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to shape public opinion. To characterize its use in real-world settings, we conducted interviews with defenders (e.g., factcheckers, journalists, officials) in Taiwan and creators (e.g., influencers, political consultants, advertisers) as well as defenders in India, centering two places characterized by high levels of online propaganda. The term ""deepfakes"", we find, exerts outsized discursive power in shaping defenders' expectations of misuse and, in turn, the interventions that are prioritized. To better characterize the space of generative propaganda, we develop a taxonomy that distinguishes between obvious versus hidden and promotional versus derogatory use. Deception was neither the main driver nor the main impact vector of AI's use; instead, Indian creators sought to persuade rather than to deceive, often making AI's use obvious in order to reduce legal and reputational risks, while Taiwan's defenders saw deception as a subset of broader efforts to distort the prevalence of strategic narratives online. AI was useful and used, however, in producing efficiency gains in communicating across languages and modes, and in evading human and algorithmic detection. Security researchers should reconsider threat models to clearly differentiate deepfakes from promotional and obvious uses, to complement and bolster the social factors that constrain misuse by internal actors, and to counter efficiency gains globally."
2509.19497,"This research examines the role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in enhancing citizen engagement in participatory budgeting. In response to challenges like declining civic participation and increased societal polarization, the study explores how online political participation can strengthen democracy and promote social equity. By integrating Generative AI into public consultation platforms, the research aims to improve citizen proposal formulation and foster effective dialogue between citizens and government. It assesses the capacities governments need to implement AI-enhanced participatory tools, considering technological dependencies and vulnerabilities. Analyzing technological structures, actors, interests, and strategies, the study contributes to understanding how technological advancements can reshape participatory institutions to better facilitate citizen involvement. Ultimately, the research highlights how Generative AI can transform participatory institutions, promoting inclusive, democratic engagement and empowering citizens."
2509.1989,"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into chatbot-like search engines poses new challenges for governing, assessing, and scrutinizing the content output by these online entities, especially in light of the Digital Service Act (DSA). In what follows, we first survey the regulation landscape in which we can situate LLM-based chatbots and the notion of moderation. Second, we outline the methodological approaches to our study: a mixed-methods audit across chatbots, languages, and elections. We investigated Copilot, ChatGPT, and Gemini across ten languages in the context of the 2024 European Parliamentary Election and the 2024 US Presidential Election. Despite the uncertainty in regulatory frameworks, we propose a set of solutions on how to situate, study, and evaluate chatbot moderation."
2509.19996,"Artificial Intelligence is increasingly pervasive across domains, with ever more complex models delivering impressive predictive performance. This fast technological advancement however comes at a concerning environmental cost, with state-of-the-art models - particularly deep neural networks and large language models - requiring substantial computational resources and energy. In this work, we present the intuition of Green AI dynamic model selection, an approach based on dynamic model selection that aims at reducing the environmental footprint of AI by selecting the most sustainable model while minimizing potential accuracy loss. Specifically, our approach takes into account the inference task, the environmental sustainability of available models, and accuracy requirements to dynamically choose the most suitable model. Our approach presents two different methods, namely Green AI dynamic model cascading and Green AI dynamic model routing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via a proof of concept empirical example based on a real-world dataset. Our results show that Green AI dynamic model selection can achieve substantial energy savings (up to ~25%) while substantially retaining the accuracy of the most energy greedy solution (up to ~95%). As conclusion, our preliminary findings highlight the potential that hybrid, adaptive model selection strategies withhold to mitigate the energy demands of modern AI systems without significantly compromising accuracy requirements."
2509.2005,"This paper develops a taxonomy of expert perspectives on the risks and likely consequences of artificial intelligence, with particular focus on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). Drawing from primary sources, we identify three predominant doctrines: (1) The dominance doctrine, which predicts that the first actor to create sufficiently advanced AI will attain overwhelming strategic superiority sufficient to cheaply neutralize its opponents' defenses; (2) The extinction doctrine, which anticipates that humanity will likely lose control of ASI, leading to the extinction of the human species or its permanent disempowerment; (3) The replacement doctrine, which forecasts that AI will automate a large share of tasks currently performed by humans, but will not be so transformative as to fundamentally reshape or bring an end to human civilization. We examine the assumptions and arguments underlying each doctrine, including expectations around the pace of AI progress and the feasibility of maintaining advanced AI under human control. While the boundaries between doctrines are sometimes porous and many experts hedge across them, this taxonomy clarifies the core axes of disagreement over the anticipated scale and nature of the consequences of AI development."
2509.20153,"This paper examines the integration of emotional intelligence into artificial intelligence systems, with a focus on affective computing and the growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, to recognize and respond to human emotions. Drawing on interdisciplinary research that combines computer science, psychology, and neuroscience, the study analyzes foundational neural architectures - CNNs for processing facial expressions and RNNs for sequential data, such as speech and text - that enable emotion recognition. It examines the transformation of human emotional experiences into structured emotional data, addressing the distinction between explicit emotional data collected with informed consent in research settings and implicit data gathered passively through everyday digital interactions. That raises critical concerns about lawful processing, AI transparency, and individual autonomy over emotional expressions in digital environments. The paper explores implications across various domains, including healthcare, education, and customer service, while addressing challenges of cultural variations in emotional expression and potential biases in emotion recognition systems across different demographic groups. From a regulatory perspective, the paper examines emotional data in the context of the GDPR and the EU AI Act frameworks, highlighting how emotional data may be considered sensitive personal data that requires robust safeguards, including purpose limitation, data minimization, and meaningful consent mechanisms."
2509.20369,"This paper presents VITA (Virtual Teaching Assistants), an adaptive distributed learning (ADL) platform that embeds a large language model (LLM)-powered chatbot (BotCaptain) to provide dialogic support, interoperable analytics, and integrity-aware assessment for workforce preparation in data science. The platform couples context-aware conversational tutoring with formative-assessment patterns designed to promote reflective reasoning. The paper describes an end-to-end data pipeline that transforms chat logs into Experience API (xAPI) statements, instructor dashboards that surface outliers for just-in-time intervention, and an adaptive pathway engine that routes learners among progression, reinforcement, and remediation content. The paper also benchmarks VITA conceptually against emerging tutoring architectures, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)--based assistants and Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)--integrated hubs, highlighting trade-offs among content grounding, interoperability, and deployment complexity. Contributions include a reusable architecture for interoperable conversational analytics, a catalog of patterns for integrity-preserving formative assessment, and a practical blueprint for integrating adaptive pathways into data-science courses. The paper concludes with implementation lessons and a roadmap (RAG integration, hallucination mitigation, and LTI~1.3 / OpenID Connect) to guide multi-course evaluations and broader adoption. In light of growing demand and scalability constraints in traditional instruction, the approach illustrates how conversational AI can support engagement, timely feedback, and personalized learning at scale. Future work will refine the platform's adaptive intelligence and examine applicability across varied educational settings."
2509.20393,"We investigate strategic deception in large language models using two complementary testbeds: Secret Agenda (across 38 models) and Insider Trading compliance (via SAE architectures). Secret Agenda reliably induced lying when deception advantaged goal achievement across all model families. Analysis revealed that autolabeled SAE features for ""deception"" rarely activated during strategic dishonesty, and feature steering experiments across 100+ deception-related features failed to prevent lying. Conversely, insider trading analysis using unlabeled SAE activations separated deceptive versus compliant responses through discriminative patterns in heatmaps and t-SNE visualizations. These findings suggest autolabel-driven interpretability approaches fail to detect or control behavioral deception, while aggregate unlabeled activations provide population-level structure for risk assessment. Results span Llama 8B/70B SAE implementations and GemmaScope under resource constraints, representing preliminary findings that motivate larger studies on feature discovery, labeling methodology, and causal interventions in realistic deception contexts."
2509.20394,"This paper introduces the Hazard-Aware System Card (HASC), a novel framework designed to enhance transparency and accountability in the development and deployment of AI systems. The HASC builds upon existing model card and system card concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's security and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of identifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement existing security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent communication of fixed flaws. By providing a single, accessible source of truth, the HASC empowers developers and stakeholders to make more informed decisions about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle. Ultimately, we also compare our proposed AI system cards with the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and discuss how they can be used to complement each other, providing greater transparency and accountability for AI systems."
2509.20419,"Democracies rely on opposition and dissent to function, but in emerging democracies, freedom of speech is often restricted. This effect intensifies during regional conflicts. This study examines how the India-Pakistan conflict of May 2025 influenced Pakistani media coverage. Analyzing approximately 2,600 news articles from three major newspapers using a large language model (LLM), the study found that war-related reporting significantly overshadowed coverage of political opposition and dissent. These findings highlight how conflict can marginalize democratic discourse, reinforcing the need to safeguard press freedom in volatile regions."
2509.21075,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly central to many applications, raising concerns about bias, fairness, and regulatory compliance. This paper reviews risks of biased outputs and their societal impact, focusing on frameworks like the EU's AI Act and the Digital Services Act. We argue that beyond constant regulation, stronger attention to competition and design governance is needed to ensure fair, trustworthy AI. This is a preprint of the Communications of the ACM article of the same title."
2509.21548,"Questions in political interviews and hearings serve strategic purposes beyond information gathering including advancing partisan narratives and shaping public perceptions. However, these strategic aspects remain understudied due to the lack of large-scale datasets for studying such discourse. Congressional hearings provide an especially rich and tractable site for studying political questioning: Interactions are structured by formal rules, witnesses are obliged to respond, and members with different political affiliations are guaranteed opportunities to ask questions, enabling comparisons of behaviors across the political spectrum.We develop a pipeline to extract question-answer pairs from unstructured hearing transcripts and construct a novel dataset of committee hearings from the 108th--117th Congress. Our analysis reveals systematic differences in questioning strategies across parties, by showing the party affiliation of questioners can be predicted from their questions alone. Our dataset and methods not only advance the study of congressional politics, but also provide a general framework for analyzing question-answering across interview-like settings."
2509.21713,"Many institutions are currently grappling with teaching artificial intelligence (AI) in the face of growing demand and relevance in our world. The Computing Research Association (CRA) has conducted 32 moderated virtual roundtable discussions of 202 experts committed to improving AI education. These discussions slot into four focus areas: AI Knowledge Areas and Pedagogy, Infrastructure Challenges in AI Education, Strategies to Increase Capacity in AI Education, and AI Education for All. Roundtables were organized around institution type to consider the particular goals and resources of different AI education environments. We identified the following high-level community needs to increase capacity in AI education. A significant digital divide creates major infrastructure hurdles, especially for smaller and under-resourced institutions. These challenges manifest as a shortage of faculty with AI expertise, who also face limited time for reskilling; a lack of computational infrastructure for students and faculty to develop and test AI models; and insufficient institutional technical support. Compounding these issues is the large burden associated with updating curricula and creating new programs. To address the faculty gap, accessible and continuous professional development is crucial for faculty to learn about AI and its ethical dimensions. This support is particularly needed for under-resourced institutions and must extend to faculty both within and outside of computing programs to ensure all students have access to AI education. We have compiled and organized a list of resources that our participant experts mentioned throughout this study. These resources contribute to a frequent request heard during the roundtables: a central repository of AI education resources for institutions to freely use across higher education."
2509.21858,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming education globally, and Malaysia is leveraging this potential through strategic policies to enhance learning and prepare students for a digital future. This article explores Malaysia's AI-driven education landscape, emphasising the National Artificial Intelligence Roadmap 2021-2025 and the Digital Education Policy. Employing a policy-driven analysis, it maps AI applications in pedagogy, curriculum design, administration, and teacher training across primary to tertiary levels. The study evaluates national strategies, identifies challenges like digital divides and ethical concerns, and conducts a comparative analysis with the United Kingdom, the United States, China, and India to draw best practices in AI policy and digital transformation. Findings highlight Malaysia's progress in AI literacy and personalised learning, alongside gaps in rural infrastructure and teacher readiness. Recommendations include strengthening governance, investing in equitable infrastructure, and fostering public-private partnerships. Targeting researchers, policymakers, and educators, this study informs Malaysia's path to becoming a regional leader in AI-driven education and contributes to global comparative education discourse."
2509.21899,"Knowledge production is often viewed as an endogenous process in which discovery arises through the recombination of existing theories, findings, and concepts. Yet given the vast space of potential recombinations, not all are equally valuable, and identifying those that may prove most generative remains challenging. We argue that a crucial form of recombination occurs when linking concepts creates knowledge gaps-empty regions in the conceptual landscape that focus scientific attention on proximal, unexplored connections and signal promising directions for future research. Using computational topology, we develop a method to systematically identify knowledge gaps in science at scale. Applying this approach to millions of articles from Microsoft Academic Graph (n = 34,363,623) over a 120-year period (1900-2020), we uncover papers that create topological gaps in concept networks, tracking how these gap-opening works reshape the scientific knowledge landscape. Our results indicate that gap-opening papers are more likely to rank among the most highly cited works (top 1-20%) compared with papers that do not introduce novel concept pairings. In contrast, papers that introduce novel combinations without opening gaps are not more likely to rank in the top 1% for citation counts, and are even less likely than baseline papers to appear in the top 5% to 20%. Our findings also suggest that gap-opening papers are more disruptive, highlighting their generative role in stimulating new directions for scientific inquiry."
2509.21972,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming education by enabling personalization, feedback, and knowledge access, while also raising concerns about risks to students and learning systems. Yet empirical evidence on these risks remains fragmented. This paper presents a systematic review of 70 empirical studies across computer science, education, and psychology. Guided by four research questions, we examine: (i) which applications of LLMs in education have been most frequently explored; (ii) how researchers have measured their impact; (iii) which risks stem from such applications; and (iv) what mitigation strategies have been proposed. We find that research on LLMs clusters around three domains: operational effectiveness, personalized applications, and interactive learning tools. Across these, model-level risks include superficial understanding, bias, limited robustness, anthropomorphism, hallucinations, privacy concerns, and knowledge constraints. When learners interact with LLMs, these risks extend to cognitive and behavioural outcomes, including reduced neural activity, over-reliance, diminished independent learning skills, and a loss of student agency. To capture this progression, we propose an LLM-Risk Adapted Learning Model that illustrates how technical risks cascade through interaction and interpretation to shape educational outcomes. As the first synthesis of empirically assessed risks, this review provides a foundation for responsible, human-centred integration of LLMs in education."
2509.22329,"The pervasive integration of artificial intelligence (AI) across domains such as healthcare, governance, finance, and education has intensified scrutiny of its ethical implications, including algorithmic bias, privacy risks, accountability, and societal impact. While ethics has received growing attention in computer science (CS) education more broadly, the specific pedagogical treatment of {AI ethics} remains under-examined. This study addresses that gap through a large-scale analysis of 3,395 publicly accessible syllabi from CS and allied areas at leading Indian institutions. Among them, only 75 syllabi (2.21%) included any substantive AI ethics content. Three key findings emerged: (1) AI ethics is typically integrated as a minor module within broader technical courses rather than as a standalone course; (2) ethics coverage is often limited to just one or two instructional sessions; and (3) recurring topics include algorithmic fairness, privacy and data governance, transparency, and societal impact. While these themes reflect growing awareness, current curricular practices reveal limited depth and consistency. This work highlights both the progress and the gaps in preparing future technologists to engage meaningfully with the ethical dimensions of AI, and it offers suggestions to strengthen the integration of AI ethics within computing curricula."
2509.22334,"Understanding student behaviour in higher education is essential for improving academic performance, supporting mental well-being, and informing institutional policies. However, most existing behavioural datasets originate from Western institutions and overlook the unique socioeconomic and infrastructural contexts of African institutions, limiting the global applicability of resulting insights. This paper introduces MakOne, a novel multimodal dataset collected over six weeks from 72 students at Makerere University, Kampala, using iLog, a mobile sensing application. The dataset integrates passive smartphone sensor data-including location, physical activity, and screen usage-with ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) that capture students' moods and daily routines. Designed to reflect the lived experiences of students in an African setting, MakOne offers a foundation for research in behaviour modeling, inclusive context-aware system design, mental health analytics, and culturally grounded educational technologies. It contributes a critical African perspective to the growing body of data-driven studies on student behaviour."
2509.2256,"Universities face surging applications and heightened expectations for fairness, making accurate admission prediction increasingly vital. This work presents a comprehensive framework that fuses machine learning, deep learning, and large language model techniques to combine structured academic and demographic variables with unstructured text signals. Drawing on more than 2,000 student records, the study benchmarks logistic regression, Naive Bayes, random forests, deep neural networks, and a stacked ensemble. Logistic regression offers a strong, interpretable baseline at 89.5% accuracy, while the stacked ensemble achieves the best performance at 91.0%, with Naive Bayes and random forests close behind. To probe text integration, GPT-4-simulated evaluations of personal statements are added as features, yielding modest gains but demonstrating feasibility for authentic essays and recommendation letters. Transparency is ensured through feature-importance visualizations and fairness audits. The audits reveal a 9% gender gap (67% male vs. 76% female) and an 11% gap by parental education, underscoring the need for continued monitoring. The framework is interpretable, fairness-aware, and deployable."
2509.22599,"Architectural facades critically shape affective perception in urban environments. Here, affect is understood as a multidimensional psychological construct encompassing valence (pleasure-displeasure) and arousal (activation-deactivation). Despite growing interest in affective responses to the built environment, the affective impact of urban architectural facades remains under-theorized. This study conducts a systematic review of 61 works, guided by the PRISMA framework, to identify which facade attributes most strongly predict affective responses operationalized as valence and arousal. Through multi-scalar synthesis and knowledge mapping, the review highlights complexity, materiality, symmetry, and bibliophilic integration as consistent predictors of affective perception across urban, building, and detail levels. Computational tools such as eye-tracking, CNN-based analysis, and parametric modeling are increasingly employed, yet remain fragmented and often overlook intangible dimensions like narrative coherence and cultural symbolism. By consolidating cross-disciplinary evidence, this review proposes a theoretical model linking physical design features to affective outcomes, and identifies methodological gaps, particularly the lack of integrative, mixed-method approaches. The findings offer a foundation for affect-aware facade design, advancing evidence-based strategies to support psychological well-being in urban contexts."
2509.22709,"The EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act directs businesses to assess their AI systems to ensure they are developed in a way that is human-centered and trustworthy. The rapid adoption of AI in the industry has outpaced ethical evaluation frameworks, leading to significant challenges in accountability, governance, data quality, human oversight, technological robustness, and environmental and societal impacts. Through structured interviews with fifteen industry professionals, paired with a literature review conducted on each of the key interview findings, this paper investigates practical approaches and challenges in the development and assessment of Trustworthy AI (TAI). The findings from participants in our study, and the subsequent literature reviews, reveal complications in risk management, compliance and accountability, which are exacerbated by a lack of transparency, unclear regulatory requirements and a rushed implementation of AI. Participants reported concerns that technological robustness and safety could be compromised by model inaccuracies, security vulnerabilities, and an overreliance on AI without proper safeguards in place. Additionally, the negative environmental and societal impacts of AI, including high energy consumption, political radicalisation, loss of culture and reinforcement of social inequalities, are areas of concern. There is a pressing need not just for risk mitigation and TAI evaluation within AI systems but for a wider approach to developing an AI landscape that aligns with the social and cultural values of the countries adopting those technologies."
2509.22711,"Partisan bias in LLMs has been evaluated to assess political leanings, typically through a broad lens and largely in Western contexts. We move beyond identifying general leanings to examine harmful, adversarial representational associations around political leaders and parties. To do so, we create datasets \textit{NeutQA-440} (non-adversarial prompts) and \textit{AdverQA-440} (adversarial prompts), which probe models for comparative plausibility judgments across the USA and India. Results show high susceptibility to biased partisan associations and pronounced asymmetries (e.g., substantially more favorable associations for U.S. Democrats than Republicans) alongside mixed-polarity concentration around India's BJP, highlighting systemic risks and motivating standardized, cross-cultural evaluation."
2509.22717,"Advanced AI systems are now being used in AI governance. Practitioners will likely delegate an increasing number of tasks to them as they improve and governance becomes harder. However, using AI for governance risks serious harms because human practitioners may not be able to understand AI decisions or determine whether they are aligned to the user's interests. Delegation may also undermine governance's legitimacy. This paper begins to develop a principled framework for when to delegate AI governance to AIs and when (and how) to maintain human participation. Administrative law, which governs agencies that are (1) more expert in their domains than the legislatures that create them and the courts that oversee them and (2) potentially misaligned to their original goals, offers useful lessons. Administrative law doctrine provides examples of clear, articulated rules for when delegation can occur, what delegation can consist of, and what processes can keep agencies aligned even as they are empowered to achieve their goals. The lessons of administrative law provide a foundation for how AI governance can use AI in a safe, accountable, and effective way."
2509.22721,"Digital transformation (DT) has become a strategic priority for public administrations, particularly due to the need to deliver more efficient and citizen-centered services and respond to societal expectations, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). In this context, the main objective of this study is to propose an innovative methodology to automatically evaluate the level of digital transformation (DT) in public sector organizations. The proposed approach combines traditional assessment methods with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The methodology follows a dual approach: on the one hand, surveys are conducted using specialized staff from various public entities; on the other, AI-based models (including neural networks and transformer architectures) are used to estimate the DT level of the organizations automatically. Our approach has been applied to a real-world case study involving local public administrations in the Valencian Community (Spain) and shown effective performance in assessing DT. While the proposed methodology has been validated in a specific local context, its modular structure and dual-source data foundation support its international scalability, acknowledging that administrative, regulatory, and DT maturity factors may condition its broader applicability. The experiments carried out in this work include (i) the creation of a domain-specific corpus derived from the surveys and websites of several organizations, used to train the proposed models; (ii) the use and comparison of diverse AI methods; and (iii) the validation of our approach using real data. The integration of technologies such as the IoT, sensor networks, and AI-based analytics can significantly support resilient, agile urban environments and the transition towards more effective and sustainable Smart City models."
2509.22725,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly positioned as solutions for education, yet evaluations often reduce their impact to narrow performance metrics. This paper reframes the question by asking ""what kind of impact should LLMs have in education?"" Drawing on Biesta's tripartite account of good education: qualification, socialisation, and subjectification, we present a meta-analysis of 133 experimental and quasi-experimental studies (k = 188). Overall, the impact of LLMs on student learning is positive but uneven. Strong effects emerge in qualification, particularly when LLMs function as tutors in sustained interventions. Socialisation outcomes appear more variable, concentrated in sustained, reflective interventions. Subjectification, linked to autonomy and learner development, remains fragile, with improvements confined to small-scale, long-term studies. This purpose-level view highlights design as the decisive factor: without scaffolds for participation and agency, LLMs privilege what is easiest to measure while neglecting broader aims of education. For HCI and education, the issue is not just whether LLMs work, but what futures they enable or foreclose."
2509.22734,"This paper explores the development and adoption of AI-based formative feedback in the context of biweekly reports in an engineering Capstone program. Each student is required to write a short report detailing their individual accomplishments over the past two weeks, which is then assessed by their advising professor. An LLM-powered tool was developed to provide students with personalized feedback on their draft reports, guiding them toward improved completeness and quality. Usage data across two rounds revealed an initial barrier to adoption, with low engagement rates. However, students who engaged in the AI feedback system demonstrated the ability to use it effectively, leading to improvements in the completeness and quality of their reports. Furthermore, the tool's task-parsing capabilities provided a novel approach to identify potential student organizational tasks and deliverables. The findings suggest initial skepticism toward the tool with a limited adoption within the studied context, however, they also highlight the potential for AI-driven tools to provide students and professors valuable insights and formative support."
2509.22735,"As increasingly capable large language model (LLM)-based agents are developed, the potential harms caused by misalignment and loss of control grow correspondingly severe. To address these risks, we propose an approach that directly measures and controls the agency of these AI systems. We conceptualize the agency of LLM-based agents as a property independent of intelligence-related measures and consistent with the interdisciplinary literature on the concept of agency. We offer (1) agency as a system property operationalized along the dimensions of preference rigidity, independent operation, and goal persistence, (2) a representation engineering approach to the measurement and control of the agency of an LLM-based agent, and (3) regulatory tools enabled by this approach: mandated testing protocols, domain-specific agency limits, insurance frameworks that price risk based on agency, and agency ceilings to prevent societal-scale risks. We view our approach as a step toward reducing the risks that motivate the ``Scientist AI'' paradigm, while still capturing some of the benefits from limited agentic behavior."
2509.22742,"Risk assessments for advanced AI systems require evaluating both the models themselves and their deployment contexts. We introduce the Societal Capacity Assessment Framework (SCAF), an indicators-based approach to measuring a society's vulnerability, coping capacity, and adaptive capacity in response to AI-related risks. SCAF adapts established resilience analysis methodologies to AI, enabling organisations to ground risk management in insights about country-level deployment conditions. It can also support stakeholders in identifying opportunities to strengthen societal preparedness for emerging AI capabilities. By bridging disparate literatures and the ""context gap"" in AI evaluation, SCAF promotes more holistic risk assessment and governance as advanced AI systems proliferate globally."
2509.22759,"Despite growing global attention to digital accessibility, research from India highlights a significant gap in accessibility training for both computing educators and software professionals. To address this need, we designed and conducted an experiential workshop aimed at building foundational capacity in accessibility practices among 77 participants, including computer science (CS) faculty and industry practitioners. The one-day workshop combined hands-on activities, tool demonstrations, and case studies to foster practical understanding and engagement. Post-workshop feedback showed that a majority of participants rated the workshop positively, with many reporting increased confidence and a shift in their perception of accessibility as a shared responsibility. Additionally, participants expressed a strong interest in applying accessibility principles within their workplaces, underscoring the workshop's practical relevance and impact. In this experience report, we detail the workshop's design, implementation, and evaluation, and offer actionable insights to guide future initiatives aimed at strengthening accessibility capacity across India's computing education and professional landscape."
2509.22872,"AI companies increasingly develop and deploy privacy-enhancing technologies, bias-constraining measures, evaluation frameworks, and alignment techniques -- framing them as addressing concerns related to data privacy, algorithmic fairness, and AI safety. This paper examines the ulterior function of these technologies as mechanisms of legal influence. First, we examine how encryption, federated learning, and synthetic data -- presented as enhancing privacy and reducing bias -- can operate as mechanisms of avoidance with existing regulations in attempts to place data operations outside the scope of traditional regulatory frameworks. Second, we investigate how emerging AI safety practices including open-source model releases, evaluations, and alignment techniques can be used as mechanisms of change that direct regulatory focus towards industry-controlled voluntary standards and self-governance. We term this phenomenon ""anti-regulatory AI"" -- the deployment of ostensibly protective technologies that simultaneously shapes the terms of regulatory oversight. Our analysis additionally reveals how technologies' anti-regulatory functions are enabled through framing that legitimizes their deployment while obscuring their use as regulatory workarounds. This paper closes with a discussion of policy implications that centers on the consideration of business incentives that drive AI development and the role of technical expertise in assessing whether these technologies fulfill their purported protections."
2509.22974,"How students utilize immediate tutoring feedback in programming education depends on various factors. Among them are the feedback quality, but also students' engagement, i.e., their perception, interpretation, and use of feedback. However, there is limited research on how students engage with various types of tutoring feedback. For this reason, we developed a learning environment that provides students with Python programming tasks and various types of immediate, AI-generated tutoring feedback. The feedback is displayed within four components. Using a mixed-methods approach (think-aloud study and eye-tracking), we conducted a study with 20 undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory programming course. Our research aims to: (1) identify what students think when they engage with the tutoring feedback components, and (2) explore the relations between the tutoring feedback components, students' visual attention, verbalized thoughts, and their immediate actions as part of the problem-solving process. The analysis of students' thoughts while engaging with 380 feedback components revealed four main themes: students express understanding or disagreement, additional information needed, and students explicitly judge the feedback. Exploring the relations between feedback, students' attention, thoughts, and actions showed a clear relationship. While expressions of understanding were associated with improvements, expressions of disagreement or need for additional information prompted students to collect another feedback component rather than act on the current information. These insights into students' engagement and decision-making processes contribute to an increased understanding of tutoring feedback and how students engage with it. Thereby, this work has implications for tool developers and educators facilitating feedback."
2509.23287,"Digital inaccessibility continues to be a significant barrier to true inclusion and equality. WebAIM's 2024 report reveals that only 4.1% of the world's top one million website homepages are fully accessible. Furthermore, the percentage of web pages with detectable Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) failures has only decreased by 1.9\% over the past five years, from 97.8%. To gain deeper insights into the persistent challenges of digital accessibility, we conducted a comprehensive survey with 160 accessibility professionals. Unlike previous studies, which often focused on technology professionals, our research examines inaccessibility through the lens of dedicated accessibility professionals, offering a more detailed analysis of the barriers they face. Our investigation explores (a) organizations' willingness to prioritize accessibility, (b) the challenges in ensuring accessibility, and (c) the current accessibility training practices in technology workspaces. This study aims to provide an updated perspective on the state of digital accessibility from the point of view of accessibility professionals."
2509.23363,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping higher education, yet current debates often feel tangled, mixing concerns about pedagogy, operations, curriculum, and the future of work without a shared framework. This paper offers a first attempt at a taxonomy to organize the diverse narratives of AI education and to inform discipline-based curricular discussions. We place these narratives within the enduring responsibility of higher education: the mission of knowledge. This mission includes not only the preservation and advancement of disciplinary expertise, but also the cultivation of skills and wisdom, i.e., forms of meta-knowledge that encompass judgment, ethics, and social responsibility. For the purpose of this paper's discussion, AI is defined as adaptive, data-driven systems that automate analysis, modeling, and decision-making, highlighting its dual role as enabler and disruptor across disciplines. We argue that the most consequential challenges lie at the level of curriculum and disciplinary purpose, where AI accelerates inquiry but also unsettles expertise and identity. We show how disciplines evolve through the interplay of research, curriculum, pedagogy, and faculty expertise, and why curricular reform is the central lever for meaningful change. Pedagogical innovation offers a strategic and accessible entry point, providing actionable steps that help faculty and students build the expertise needed to engage in deeper curricular rethinking and disciplinary renewal. Within this framing, we suggest that meaningful reform can move forward through structured faculty journeys: from AI literacy to pedagogy, curriculum design, and research integration. The key is to align these journeys with the mission of knowledge, turning the disruptive pressures of AI into opportunities for disciplines to sustain expertise, advance inquiry, and serve society."
2509.23843,"In 2020, a Dutch court passed judgment in a case about a digital welfare fraud detection system called Systeem Risico Indicatie (SyRI). The court ruled that the SyRI legislation is unlawful because it does not comply with the right to privacy under the European Convention of Human Rights. In this article we analyse the judgment and its implications. This ruling is one of first in which a court has invalidated a welfare fraud detection system for breaching the right to privacy. We show that the immediate effects of the judgment are limited. The judgment does not say much about automated fraud detection systems in general, because it is limited to the circumstances of the case. Still, the judgment is important. The judgment reminds policymakers that fraud detection must happen in a way that respects data protection principles and the right to privacy. The judgment also confirms the importance of transparency if personal data are used."
2509.23848,"The GDPR contains an accuracy principle, as most data privacy laws in the world do. In principle, data controllers must ensure that personal data they use are accurate. Some have argued that the accuracy principle does not apply to personal data in the form of opinions about data subjects. We argue, however, from a positive law perspective, that the accuracy principle does apply to opinions. We further argue, from a normative perspective, that the accuracy principle should apply to opinions."
2509.23851,"Our society can benefit immensely from algorithmic decision-making and similar types of artificial intelligence. But algorithmic decision-making can also have discriminatory effects. This paper examines that problem, using online price differentiation as an example of algorithmic decision-making. With online price differentiation, a company charges different people different prices for identical products, based on information the company has about those people. The main question in this paper is: to what extent can non-discrimination law protect people against online price differentiation? The paper shows that online price differentiation and algorithmic decision-making could lead to indirect discrimination, for instance harming people with a certain ethnicity. Indirect discrimination occurs when a practice is neutral at first glance, but ends up discriminating against people with a protected characteristic, such as ethnicity. In principle, non-discrimination law prohibits indirect discrimination. The paper also shows, however, that non-discrimination law has flaws when applied to algorithmic decision-making. For instance, algorithmic discrimination can remain hidden: people may not realise that they are being discriminated against. And many types of unfair - some might say discriminatory - algorithmic decisions are outside the scope of current non-discrimination law."
2509.24065,"This paper grounds ethics in evolutionary biology, viewing moral norms as adaptive mechanisms that render cooperation fitness-viable under selection pressure. Current alignment approaches add ethics post hoc, treating it as an external constraint rather than embedding it as an evolutionary strategy for cooperation. The central question is whether normative architectures can be embedded directly into AI systems to sustain human--AI cooperation (symbiosis) as capabilities scale. To address this, I propose a governance--embedding--representation pipeline linking moral representation learning to system-level design and institutional governance, treating alignment as a multi-level problem spanning cognition, optimization, and oversight. I formalize moral norm representation through the moral problem space, a learnable subspace in neural representations where cooperative norms can be encoded and causally manipulated. Using sparse autoencoders, activation steering, and causal interventions, I outline a research program for engineering moral representations and embedding them into the full semantic space -- treating competing theories of morality as empirical hypotheses about representation geometry rather than philosophical positions. Governance principles leverage these learned moral representations to regulate how cooperative behaviors evolve within the AI ecosystem. Through replicator dynamics and multi-agent game theory, I model how internal representational features can shape population-level incentives by motivating the design of sanctions and subsidies structured to yield decentralized normative institutions."
2509.24345,"The emergence of big data, AI and machine learning has allowed sellers and online platforms to tailor pricing for customers in real-time. While online algorithmic pricing can increase efficiency, market welfare, and optimize pricing strategies for sellers and companies, it poses a threat to the fundamental values of privacy, digital autonomy, and non-discrimination, raising legal and ethical concerns. On both sides of the Atlantic, legislators have endeavoured to regulate online algorithmic pricing in different ways in the context of privacy and personal data protection. Represented by the GDPR, the EU adopts an omnibus approach to regulate algorithmic pricing and is supplemented by the Digital Service Act and the Digital Market Act. The US combines federal and state laws to regulate online algorithmic pricing and focuses on industrial regulations. Therefore, a comparative analysis of these legal frameworks is necessary to ascertain the effectiveness of these approaches. Taking a comparative approach, this working paper aims to explore how EU and US respective data protection and privacy laws address the issues posed by online algorithmic pricing. The paper evaluates whether the current legal regime is effective in protecting individuals against the perils of online algorithmic pricing in the EU and the US. It particularly analyses the new EU regulatory paradigm, the Digital Service Act (DSA) and the Digital Market Act (DMA), as supplementary mechanisms to the EU data protection law, in order to draw lessons for US privacy law and vice versa."
2509.24394,"Prominent AI companies are producing 'safety frameworks' as a type of voluntary self-governance. These statements purport to establish risk thresholds and safety procedures for the development and deployment of highly capable AI. Understanding which AI risks are covered and what actions are allowed, refused, demanded, encouraged, or discouraged by these statements is vital for assessing how these frameworks actually govern AI development and deployment. We draw on affordance theory to analyse the OpenAI 'Preparedness Framework Version 2' (April 2025) using the Mechanisms & Conditions model of affordances and the MIT AI Risk Repository. We find that this safety policy requests evaluation of a small minority of AI risks, encourages deployment of systems with 'Medium' capabilities for unintentionally enabling 'severe harm' (which OpenAI defines as >1000 deaths or >$100B in damages), and allows OpenAI's CEO to deploy even more dangerous capabilities. These findings suggest that effective mitigation of AI risks requires more robust governance interventions beyond current industry self-regulation. Our affordance analysis provides a replicable method for evaluating what safety frameworks actually permit versus what they claim."
2509.24646,"The paper discusses legal aspects relevant to the development of research software and practical approaches taken by research software engineers to deal with them. Intellectual Property Rights on software are considered alongside licensing choices made by the research community. The discussion addresses the ambiguities in the identification of the copyright holder of research software, the uncertainty surrounding liability, and remarks the varying level of support on legal matters provided by research organisations. The paper also reflects on the widespread use of AI coding assistants in the absence of institutional policies, and on the new AI regulations passed by the European Union. The aim of the contribution is to point out that a better understanding of legal matters concerning software development is an asset in giving research software the right value it deserves as a driver of scientific progress."
2509.25063,"Survey researchers face two key challenges: the rising costs of probability samples and missing data (e.g., non-response or attrition), which can undermine inference and increase the use of convenience samples. Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) to simulate respondents via persona-based prompts, often without labeled data. We study a more practical setting where partial survey responses exist: we fine-tune LLMs on available data to impute self-reported vote choice under both random and systematic nonresponse, using the German Longitudinal Election Study. We compare zero-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning against tabular classifiers (e.g., CatBoost) and test how different convenience samples (e.g., students) used for fine-tuning affect generalization.Our results show that when data are missing completely at random, fine-tuned LLMs match tabular classifiers but outperform zero-shot approaches. When only biased convenience samples are available, fine-tuning small (3B to 8B) open-source LLMs can recover both individual-level predictions and population-level distributions more accurately than zero-shot and often better than tabular methods. This suggests fine-tuned LLMs offer a promising strategy for researchers working with non-probability samples or systematic missingness, and may enable new survey designs requiring only easily accessible subpopulations."
2509.25256,"The systematic assessment of AI systems is increasingly vital as these technologies enter high-stakes domains. To address this, the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act introduces AI Regulatory Sandboxes (AIRS): supervised environments where AI systems can be tested under the oversight of Competent Authorities (CAs), balancing innovation with compliance, particularly for startups and SMEs. Yet significant challenges remain: assessment methods are fragmented, tests lack standardisation, and feedback loops between developers and regulators are weak. To bridge these gaps, we propose the Sandbox Configurator, a modular open-source framework that enables users to select domain-relevant tests from a shared library and generate customised sandbox environments with integrated dashboards. Its plug-in architecture aims to support both open and proprietary modules, fostering a shared ecosystem of interoperable AI assessment services. The framework aims to address multiple stakeholders: CAs gain structured workflows for applying legal obligations; technical experts can integrate robust evaluation methods; and AI providers access a transparent pathway to compliance. By promoting cross-border collaboration and standardisation, the Sandbox Configurator's goal is to support a scalable and innovation-friendly European infrastructure for trustworthy AI governance."
2509.25258,"Practical lab education in computer science often faces challenges such as plagiarism, lack of proper lab records, unstructured lab conduction, inadequate execution and assessment, limited practical learning, low student engagement, and absence of progress tracking for both students and faculties, resulting in graduates with insufficient hands-on skills. In this paper, we introduce AsseslyAI, which addresses these challenges through online lab allocation, a unique lab problem for each student, AI-proctored viva evaluations, and gamified simulators to enhance engagement and conceptual mastery. While existing platforms generate questions based on topics, our framework fine-tunes on a 10k+ question-answer dataset built from AI/ML lab questions to dynamically generate diverse, code-rich assessments. Validation metrics show high question-answer similarity, ensuring accurate answers and non-repetitive questions. By unifying dataset-driven question generation, adaptive difficulty, plagiarism resistance, and evaluation in a single pipeline, our framework advances beyond traditional automated grading tools and offers a scalable path to produce genuinely skilled graduates."
2509.25266,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping educational practice, challenging long held assumptions about teaching and learning. This article integrates conceptual perspectives from recent books (Genesis by Eric Schmidt, Henry Kissinger and Craig Mundie, CoIntelligence by Ethan Mollick, and The Inevitable by Kevin Kelly) with empirical insights from popular AI podcasts and Anthropic public releases. We examine seven key domains: emotional support, creativity, contextual understanding, student engagement, problem solving, ethics and morality, and collaboration. For each domain, we explore AI capabilities, opportunities for transformative change, and emerging best practices, drawing equally from theoretical analysis and real world observations. Overall, we find that AI, when used thoughtfully, can complement and enhance human educators in fostering richer learning experiences across cognitive, social, and emotional dimensions. We emphasize an optimistic yet responsible outlook: educators and students should actively shape AI integration to amplify human potential in creativity, ethical reasoning, collaboration, and beyond, while maintaining a focus on human centric values."
2509.25283,"This study examines whether LLMs can simulate culturally grounded psychological patterns based on demographic information. Using DeepSeek, we generated 2943 virtual participants matched to demographic distributions from the CFPS2018 and compared them with human responses on the Big Five personality traits and subjective well-being across seven Chinesethis http URLwas measured using a 15-item Chinese Big Five inventory, and happiness with a single-item rating. Results revealed broad similarity between real and simulated datasets, particularly in regional variation trends. However, systematic differences emerged:simulated participants scored lower in extraversion and openness, higher in agreeableness and neuroticism, and consistently reported lower happiness. Predictive structures also diverged: while human data identified conscientiousness, extraversion and openness as positive predictors of happiness, the AI emphasized openness and agreeableness, with extraversion predicting negatively. These discrepancies suggest that while LLMs can approximate population-level psychological distributions, they underrepresent culturally specific and affective dimensions. The findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLM-based virtual participants for large-scale psychological research and underscore the need for culturally enriched training data and improved affective modeling."
2509.25286,"Political beliefs vary significantly across different countries, reflecting distinct historical, cultural, and institutional contexts. These ideologies, ranging from liberal democracies to rigid autocracies, influence human societies, as well as the digital systems that are constructed within those societies. The advent of generative artificial intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), introduces new agents in the political space-agents trained on massive corpora that replicate and proliferate socio-political assumptions. This paper analyses whether LLMs display propensities consistent with democratic or autocratic world-views. We validate this insight through experimental tests in which we experiment with the leading LLMs developed across disparate political contexts, using several existing psychometric and political orientation measures. The analysis is based on both numerical scoring and qualitative analysis of the models' responses. Findings indicate high model-to-model variability and a strong association with the political culture of the country in which the model was developed. These findings highlight the need for more detailed examination of the socio-political dimensions embedded within AI systems."
2509.25292,"The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has been proposed as a unifying standard for connecting large language models (LLMs) with external tools and resources, promising the same role for AI integration that HTTP and USB played for the Web and peripherals. Yet, despite rapid adoption and hype, its trajectory remains uncertain. Are MCP marketplaces truly growing, or merely inflated by placeholders and abandoned prototypes? Are servers secure and privacy-preserving, or do they expose users to systemic risks? And do clients converge on standardized protocols, or remain fragmented across competing designs? In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of the MCP ecosystem. We design and implement MCPCrawler, a systematic measurement framework that collects and normalizes data from six major markets. Over a 14-day campaign, MCPCrawler aggregated 17,630 raw entries, of which 8,401 valid projects (8,060 servers and 341 clients) were analyzed. Our results reveal that more than half of listed projects are invalid or low-value, that servers face structural risks including dependency monocultures and uneven maintenance, and that clients exhibit a transitional phase in protocol and connection patterns. Together, these findings provide the first evidence-based view of the MCP ecosystem, its risks, and its future trajectory."
2509.25293,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly permeating classrooms worldwide, yet its adoption in schools of developing countries remains under-explored. This paper investigates AI adoption, usage patterns, and perceived impact in Pakistani K-12 schools based on a survey of 125 educators. The questionnaire covered educator's familiarity with AI, frequency and modes of use, and attitudes toward AI's benefits and challenges. Results reveal a generally positive disposition towards AI: over two-thirds of teachers expressed willingness to adopt AI tools given proper support and many have begun integrating AI for lesson planning and content creation. However, AI usage is uneven - while about one-third of respondents actively use AI tools frequently, others remain occasional users. Content generation emerged as the most common AI application, whereas AI-driven grading and feedback are rarely used. Teachers reported moderate improvements in student engagement and efficiency due to AI, but also voiced concerns about equitable access. These findings highlight both the enthusiasm for AI's potential in Pakistan's schools and the need for training and infrastructure to ensure inclusive and effective implementation."
2509.25298,"This study investigates the shifting global dynamics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research by analysing the trajectories of countries dominating AI publications between 2000 and 2025. Drawing on the comprehensive OpenAlex dataset and employing fractional counting to avoid double attribution in co-authored work, the research maps the relative shares of AI publications across major global players. The analysis reveals a profound restructuring of the international AI research landscape. The US and the European Union (EU27), once the undisputed and established leaders, have experienced a notable decline in relative dominance, with their combined share of publications falling from over 57% in 2000 to less than 25% in 2025. In contrast, China has undergone a dramatic ascent, expanding its global share of AI publications from under 5% in 2000 to nearly 36% by 2025, thereby emerging as the single most dominant contributor. Alongside China, India has also risen substantially, consolidating a multipolar Asian research ecosystem. These empirical findings highlight the strategic implications of concentrated research output, particularly China's capacity to shape the future direction of AI innovation and standard-setting. While the study calculates the volume of AI publications (in percentage as global share) as a measure of research dominance, it also acknowledges limitations in capturing quality and impact, suggesting scholarly research areas for future work on high-impact AI scholarship."
2509.25496,"While research in AI methods for music generation and analysis has grown in scope and impact, AI researchers' engagement with the ethical consequences of this work has not kept pace. To encourage such engagement, many publication venues have introduced optional or required ethics statements for AI research papers. Though some authors use these ethics statements to critically engage with the broader implications of their research, we find that the majority of ethics statements in the AI music literature do not appear to be effectively utilized for this purpose. In this work, we conduct a review of ethics statements across ISMIR, NIME, and selected prominent works in AI music from the past five years. We then offer suggestions for both audio conferences and researchers for engaging with ethics statements in ways that foster meaningful reflection rather than formulaic compliance."
2509.25524,"The growth and permeation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across society has drawn focus to the ways in which the responsible use of these technologies can be facilitated through AI governance. Increasingly, large companies and governments alike have begun to articulate and, in some cases, enforce governance preferences through AI policy. Yet existing literature documents an unwieldy heterogeneity in ethical principles for AI governance, while our own prior research finds that discussions of the implications of AI policy are not yet present in the computer science (CS) curriculum. In this context, overlapping jurisdictions and even contradictory policy preferences across private companies, local, national, and multinational governments create a complex landscape for AI policy which, we argue, will require AI developers able adapt to an evolving regulatory environment. Preparing computing students for the new challenges of an AI-dominated technology industry is therefore a key priority for the CS curriculum.In this discussion paper, we seek to articulate a framework for integrating discussions on the nascent AI policy landscape into computer science courses. We begin by summarizing recent AI policy efforts in the United States and European Union. Subsequently, we propose guiding questions to frame class discussions around AI policy in technical and non-technical (e.g., ethics) CS courses. Throughout, we emphasize the connection between normative policy demands and still-open technical challenges relating to their implementation and enforcement through code and governance structures. This paper therefore represents a valuable contribution towards bridging research and discussions across the areas of AI policy and CS education, underlining the need to prepare AI engineers to interact with and adapt to societal policy preferences."
2509.25529,"As personalized learning gains increasing attention in mathematics education, there is a growing demand for intelligent systems that can assess complex student responses and provide individualized feedback in real time. In this study, we present a personalized auto-grading and feedback system for constructive geometry tasks, developed using large language models (LLMs) and deployed on the Algeomath platform, a Korean online tool designed for interactive geometric constructions. The proposed system evaluates student-submitted geometric constructions by analyzing their procedural accuracy and conceptual understanding. It employs a prompt-based grading mechanism using GPT-4, where student answers and model solutions are compared through a few-shot learning approach. Feedback is generated based on teacher-authored examples built from anticipated student responses, and it dynamically adapts to the student's problem-solving history, allowing up to four iterative attempts per question. The system was piloted with 79 middle-school students, where LLM-generated grades and feedback were benchmarked against teacher judgments. Grading closely aligned with teachers, and feedback helped many students revise errors and complete multi-step geometry tasks. While short-term corrections were frequent, longer-term transfer effects were less clear. Overall, the study highlights the potential of LLMs to support scalable, teacher-aligned formative assessment in mathematics, while pointing to improvements needed in terminology handling and feedback design."
2509.25539,"The evolution of digital communication systems and the designs of online platforms have inadvertently facilitated the subconscious propagation of toxic behavior. Giving rise to reactive responses to toxic behavior. Toxicity in online content and Artificial Intelligence Systems has become a serious challenge to individual and collective well-being around the world. It is more detrimental to society than we realize. Toxicity, expressed in language, image, and video, can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context of usage. Therefore, a comprehensive taxonomy is crucial to detect and mitigate toxicity in online content, Artificial Intelligence systems, and/or Large Language Models in a proactive manner. A comprehensive understanding of toxicity is likely to facilitate the design of practical solutions for toxicity detection and mitigation. The classification in published literature has focused on only a limited number of aspects of this very complex issue, with a pattern of reactive strategies in response to toxicity. This survey attempts to generate a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity from various perspectives. It presents a holistic approach to explain the toxicity by understanding the context and environment that society is facing in the Artificial Intelligence era. This survey summarizes the toxicity-related datasets and research on toxicity detection and mitigation for Large Language Models, social media platforms, and other online platforms, detailing their attributes in textual mode, focused on the English language. Finally, we suggest the research gaps in toxicity mitigation based on datasets, mitigation strategies, Large Language Models, adaptability, explainability, and evaluation."
2509.25701,"Peer review is the primary mechanism for evaluating scientific contributions, yet prior studies have mostly examined paper features or external metadata in isolation. The emergence of open platforms such as OpenReview has transformed peer review into a transparent and interactive process, recording not only scores and comments but also rebuttals, reviewer-author exchanges, reviewer disagreements, and meta-reviewer decisions. This provides unprecedented process-level data for understanding how modern peer review operates. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of ICLR 2017-2025, encompassing over 28,000 submissions. Our analysis integrates four complementary dimensions, including the structure and language quality of papers (e.g., section patterns, figure/table ratios, clarity), submission strategies and external metadata (e.g., timing, arXiv posting, author count), the dynamics of author-reviewer interactions (e.g., rebuttal frequency, responsiveness), and the patterns of reviewer disagreement and meta-review mediation (e.g., score variance, confidence weighting). Our results show that factors beyond scientific novelty significantly shape acceptance outcomes. In particular, the rebuttal stage emerges as a decisive phase: timely, substantive, and interactive author-reviewer communication strongly increases the likelihood of acceptance, often outweighing initial reviewer skepticism. Alongside this, clearer writing, balanced visual presentation, earlier submission, and effective resolution of reviewer disagreement also correlate with higher acceptance probabilities. Based on these findings, we propose data-driven guidelines for authors, reviewers, and meta-reviewers to enhance transparency and fairness in peer review. Our study demonstrates that process-centric signals are essential for understanding and improving modern peer review."
2509.2615,"""Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble."" As Shakespeare's witches foretold chaos through cryptic prophecies, modern capital markets grapple with systemic risks concealed by opaque AI systems. According to IMF, the August 5, 2024, plunge in Japanese and U.S. equities can be linked to algorithmic trading yet ab-sent from existing AI incidents database exemplifies this transparency crisis. Current AI incident databases, reliant on crowdsourcing or news scraping, systematically over-look capital market anomalies, particularly in algorithmic and high-frequency trading. We address this critical gap by proposing a regulatory-grade global database that elegantly synthesises post-trade reporting frameworks with proven incident documentation models from healthcare and aviation. Our framework's temporal data omission technique masking timestamps while preserving percent-age-based metrics enables sophisticated cross-jurisdictional analysis of emerging risks while safeguarding confidential business information. Synthetic data validation (modelled after real life published incidents , sentiments, data) reveals compelling pat-terns: systemic risks transcending geographical boundaries, market manipulation clusters distinctly identifiable via K-means algorithms, and AI system typology exerting significantly greater influence on trading behaviour than geographical location, This tripartite solution empowers regulators with unprecedented cross-jurisdictional oversight, financial institutions with seamless compliance integration, and investors with critical visibility into previously obscured AI-driven vulnerabilities. We call for immediate action to strengthen risk management and foster resilience in AI-driven financial markets against the volatile ""cauldron"" of AI-driven systemic risks., promoting global financial stability through enhanced transparency and coordinated oversight."
2509.26332,"Recently, the unequal presence of women compared to men in technology has attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners across multiple fields. It is time to regard this problem as a global crisis that not only limits access to talent but also reduces the diversity of perspectives that shape technological innovation. This article examines the psychological and social barriers that influence this gap, as well as the interventions designed to reduce it. Using a structured review, the findings assemble evidence on the role of early gender stereotypes in the family and school and the continuation of this crisis in educational and career choices, through to the psychological challenges women face in professional settings, such as feelings of self-undervaluation, occupational anxiety, a heightened fear of technology, and structural limitations in educational environments. Special attention is paid to Germany, where the technology gap is particularly evident and where multiple national programs have been implemented to address it. The present review shows that effective solutions require more than anti-discrimination policies: they should include educational practices, organizational reforms, mentoring, and psychological support. The article concludes by outlining practical and research implications and introduces the NEURON project as a pilot interdisciplinary initiative aimed at accelerating current empowerment efforts and developing new programs for women in technology occupations."
2509.26483,"This study presents the first large-scale, side-by-side comparison of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) in the automated grading of programming assignments. Drawing on over 6,000 student submissions collected across four years of an introductory programming course, we systematically analysed the distribution of grades, differences in mean scores and variability reflecting stricter or more lenient grading, and the consistency and clustering of grading patterns across models. Eighteen publicly available models were evaluated: Anthropic (claude-3-5-haiku, claude-opus-4-1, claude-sonnet-4); Deepseek (deepseek-chat, deepseek-reasoner); Google (gemini-2.0-flash-lite, gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-2.5-flash-lite, gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro); and OpenAI (gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-4.1, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5). Statistical tests, correlation and clustering analyses revealed clear, systematic differences between and within vendor families, with ""mini"" and ""nano"" variants consistently underperforming their full-scale counterparts. All models displayed high internal agreement, measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient, with the model consensus but only moderate agreement with human teachers' grades, indicating a persistent gap between automated and human assessment. These findings underscore that the choice of model for educational deployment is not neutral and should be guided by pedagogical goals, transparent reporting of evaluation metrics, and ongoing human oversight to ensure accuracy, fairness and relevance."
2510.00091,"This study reinterprets a Monte Carlo simulation of students' perceived success with generative AI (GenAI) through a Kantian-axiomatic lens. Building on prior work, theme-level survey statistics Ease of Use and Learnability, System Efficiency and Learning Burden, and Perceived Complexity and Integration from a representative dataset are used to generate 10,000 synthetic scores per theme on the [1,5] Likert scale. The simulated outputs are evaluated against the axioms of dense linear order without endpoints (DLO): irreflexivity, transitivity, total comparability (connectedness), no endpoints (no greatest and no least; A4-A5), and density (A6). At the data level, the basic ordering axioms (A1-A3) are satisfied, whereas no-endpoints (A4-A5) and density (A6) fail as expected. Likert clipping introduces minimum and maximum observed values, and a finite, discretized sample need not contain a value strictly between any two distinct scores. These patterns are read not as methodological defects but as markers of an epistemological boundary. Following Kant and Friedman, the findings suggest that what simulations capture finite, quantized observations cannot instantiate the ideal properties of an unbounded, dense continuum. Such properties belong to constructive intuition rather than to finite sampling alone. A complementary visualization contrasts the empirical histogram with a sine-curve proxy to clarify this divide. The contribution is interpretive rather than data-expansive: it reframes an existing simulation as a probe of the synthetic a priori structure underlying students' perceptions, showing how formal order-theoretic coherence coexists with principled failures of endpoint-freeness and density in finite empirical models."
2510.00312,"Artificial intelligence is set to revolutionize social and political life in unpredictable ways, raising questions about the principles that ought to guide its development and regulation. By examining digital advertising and social media algorithms, this article highlights how artificial intelligence already poses a significant threat to the republican conception of liberty -- or freedom from unaccountable power -- and thereby highlights the necessity of protecting republican liberty when integrating artificial intelligence into society. At an individual level, these algorithms can subconsciously influence behavior and thought, and those subject to this influence have limited power over the algorithms they engage. At the political level, these algorithms give technology company executives and other foreign parties the power to influence domestic political processes, such as elections; the multinational nature of algorithm-based platforms and the speed with which technology companies innovate make incumbent state institutions ineffective at holding these actors accountable. At both levels, artificial intelligence has thus created a new form of unfreedom: digital domination. By drawing on the works of Quentin Skinner, Philip Pettit, and other republican theorists, this article asserts that individuals must have mechanisms to hold algorithms (and those who develop them) accountable in order to be truly free."
2510.0099,"The study of art evolution has provided valuable insights into societal change, often revealing long-term patterns of simplification and transformation. Album covers represent a distinctive yet understudied form of visual art that has both shaped and been shaped by cultural, technological, and commercial dynamics over the past century. As highly visible artifacts at the intersection of art and commerce, they offer a unique lens through which to study cultural evolution. In this work, we examine the visual complexity of album covers spanning 75 years and 11 popular musical genres. Using a diverse set of computational measures that capture multiple dimensions of visual complexity, our analysis reveals a broad shift toward minimalism across most genres, with notable exceptions that highlight the heterogeneity of aesthetic trends. At the same time, we observe growing variance over time, with many covers continuing to display high levels of abstraction and intricacy. Together, these findings position album covers as a rich, quantifiable archive of cultural history and underscore the value of computational approaches in the systematic study of the arts, bridging quantitative analysis with aesthetic and cultural inquiry."
2510.01275,"The increasing adoption of generative AI (GenAI) tools such as chatbots in education presents new opportunities to support students' self-regulated learning (SRL), but also raises concerns about how learners actually engage in planning, executing, and reflection when learning with a chatbot. While SRL is typically conceptualized as a sequential process, little is known about how it unfolds during real-world student-chatbot interactions. To explore this, we proposed Gen-SRL, an annotation schema to categorize student prompts into 16 microlevel actions across 4 macrolevel phases. Using the proposed schema, we annotated 212 chatbot interactions from a real-world English writing task. We then performed frequency analysis and process mining (PM) techniques to discover SRL patterns in depth. Our results revealed that students' SRL behaviours were imbalanced, with over 82% of actions focused on task execution and limited engagement in planning and reflection. In addition, the process analysis showed nonsequential regulation patterns. Our findings suggest that classical SRL theories cannot fully capture the dynamic SRL patterns that emerge during chatbot interactions. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of designing adaptive and personalized scaffolds that respond to students' dynamic behaviours in chatbot-powered contexts. More importantly, this study offers a new perspective for advancing SRL research and suggests directions for developing chatbots that better support self-regulation."
2510.01281,"The European Union's AI Act represents a crucial step towards regulating ethical and responsible AI systems. However, we find an absence of quantifiable fairness metrics and the ambiguity in terminology, particularly the interchangeable use of the keywords transparency, explainability, and interpretability in the new EU AI Act and no reference of transparency of ethical compliance. We argue that this ambiguity creates substantial liability risk that would deter investment. Fairness transparency is strategically important. We recommend a more tailored regulatory framework to enhance the new EU AI regulation. Further-more, we propose a public system framework to assess the fairness and transparency of AI systems. Drawing from past work, we advocate for the standardization of industry best practices as a necessary addition to broad regulations to achieve the level of details required in industry, while preventing stifling innovation and investment in the AI sector. The proposals are exemplified with the case of ASR and speech synthesizers."
2510.01286,"Large language models are proliferating, and so are the benchmarks that serve as their common yardsticks. We ask how the agglomeration patterns of these two layers compare: do they evolve in tandem or diverge? Drawing on two curated proxies for the ecosystem, the Stanford Foundation-Model Ecosystem Graph and the Evidently AI benchmark registry, we find complementary but contrasting dynamics. Model creation has broadened across countries and organizations and diversified in modality, licensing, and access. Benchmark influence, by contrast, displays centralizing patterns: in the inferred benchmark-author-institution network, the top 15% of nodes account for over 80% of high-betweenness paths, three countries produce 83% of benchmark outputs, and the global Gini for inferred benchmark authority reaches 0.89. An agent-based simulation highlights three mechanisms: higher entry of new benchmarks reduces concentration; rapid inflows can temporarily complicate coordination in evaluation; and stronger penalties against over-fitting have limited effect. Taken together, these results suggest that concentrated benchmark influence functions as coordination infrastructure that supports standardization, comparability, and reproducibility amid rising heterogeneity in model production, while also introducing trade-offs such as path dependence, selective visibility, and diminishing discriminative power as leaderboards saturate."
2510.01395,"Both the general public and academic communities have raised concerns about sycophancy, the phenomenon of artificial intelligence (AI) excessively agreeing with or flattering users. Yet, beyond isolated media reports of severe consequences, like reinforcing delusions, little is known about the extent of sycophancy or how it affects people who use AI. Here we show the pervasiveness and harmful impacts of sycophancy when people seek advice from AI. First, across 11 state-of-the-art AI models, we find that models are highly sycophantic: they affirm users' actions 50% more than humans do, and they do so even in cases where user queries mention manipulation, deception, or other relational harms. Second, in two preregistered experiments (N = 1604), including a live-interaction study where participants discuss a real interpersonal conflict from their life, we find that interaction with sycophantic AI models significantly reduced participants' willingness to take actions to repair interpersonal conflict, while increasing their conviction of being in the right. However, participants rated sycophantic responses as higher quality, trusted the sycophantic AI model more, and were more willing to use it again. This suggests that people are drawn to AI that unquestioningly validate, even as that validation risks eroding their judgment and reducing their inclination toward prosocial behavior. These preferences create perverse incentives both for people to increasingly rely on sycophantic AI models and for AI model training to favor sycophancy. Our findings highlight the necessity of explicitly addressing this incentive structure to mitigate the widespread risks of AI sycophancy."
2510.01467,"The rapid emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies has the potential to dramatically influence higher education, raising questions about the roles of institutions, educators, and students in a technology-rich future. While existing discourse often emphasizes either the promise and peril of AI or its immediate implementation, this paper advances a third path: a principled framework for guiding the use of AI in teaching and learning. Drawing on decades of scholarship in the learning sciences and uses of technology in education, I articulate a set of principles that connect broad our educational goalsto actionable practices. These principles clarify the respective roles of educators, learners, and technologies in shaping curricula, designing instruction, assessing learning, and cultivating community. The piece illustrates how a principled approach enables higher education to harness new tools while preserving its fundamental mission: advancing meaningful learning, supporting democratic societies, and preparing students for dynamic futures. Ultimately, this framework seeks to ensure that AI augments rather than displaces human capacities, aligning technology use with enduring educational values and goals."
2510.0147,"Data from online job postings are difficult to access and are not built in a standard or transparent manner. Data included in the standard taxonomy and occupational information database (O*NET) are updated infrequently and based on small survey samples. We adopt O*NET as a framework for building natural language processing tools that extract structured information from job postings. We publish the Job Ad Analysis Toolkit (JAAT), a collection of open-source tools built for this purpose, and demonstrate its reliability and accuracy in out-of-sample and LLM-as-a-Judge testing. We extract more than 10 billion data points from more than 155 million online job ads provided by the National Labor Exchange (NLx) Research Hub, including O*NET tasks, occupation codes, tools, and technologies, as well as wages, skills, industry, and more features. We describe the construction of a dataset of occupation, state, and industry level features aggregated by monthly active jobs from 2015 - 2025. We illustrate the potential for research and future uses in education and workforce development."
2510.01757,"Digital media have become central to how labor unions communicate, organize, and sustain collective action. Yet little is known about how unions' online discourse relates to concrete outcomes such as representation elections. This study addresses the gap by combining National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election data with 158k Facebook posts published by U.S. labor unions between 2015 and 2024. We focused on five discourse frames widely recognized in labor and social movement communication research: diagnostic (identifying problems), prognostic (proposing solutions), motivational (mobilizing action), community (emphasizing solidarity), and engagement (promoting interaction). Using a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, we systematically annotated unions' posts and analyzed patterns of frame usage around election events. Our findings showed that diagnostic and community frames dominated union communication overall, but that frame usage varied substantially across organizations. In election cases that unions won, communication leading up to the vote showed an increased use of diagnostic, prognostic, and community frames, followed by a reduction in prognostic and motivational framing after the event--patterns consistent with strategic preparation. By contrast, in lost election cases unions showed little adjustment in their communication, suggesting an absence of tailored communication strategies. By examining variation in message-level framing, the study highlights how communication strategies adapt to organizational contexts, contributing open tools and data and complementing prior research in understanding digital communication of unions and social movements."
2510.01889,"The energy consumption and carbon footprint of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become critical concerns due to rising costs and environmental impacts. In response, a new trend in green AI is emerging, shifting from the ""bigger is better"" paradigm, which prioritizes large models, to ""small is sufficient"", emphasizing energy sobriety through smaller, more efficient models.We explore how the AI community can adopt energy sobriety today by focusing on model selection during inference. Model selection consists of choosing the most appropriate model for a given task, a simple and readily applicable method, unlike approaches requiring new hardware or architectures. Our hypothesis is that, as in many industrial activities, marginal utility gains decrease with increasing model size. Thus, applying model selection can significantly reduce energy consumption while maintaining good utility for AI inference.We conduct a systematic study of AI tasks, analyzing their popularity, model size, and efficiency. We examine how the maturity of different tasks and model adoption patterns impact the achievable energy savings, ranging from 1% to 98% for different tasks. Our estimates indicate that applying model selection could reduce AI energy consumption by 27.8%, saving 31.9 TWh worldwide in 2025 - equivalent to the annual output of five nuclear power reactors."
2510.02036,"Current bias evaluation methods rarely engage with communities impacted by AI systems. Inspired by bug bounties, bias bounties have been proposed as a reward-based method that involves communities in AI bias detection by asking users of AI systems to report biases they encounter when interacting with such systems. In the absence of a state-of-the-art review, this survey aimed to identify and analyse existing AI bias bounty programmes and to present academic literature on bias bounties. Google, Google Scholar, PhilPapers, and IEEE Xplore were searched, and five bias bounty programmes, as well as five research publications, were identified. All bias bounties were organised by U.S.-based organisations as time-limited contests, with public participation in four programmes and prize pools ranging from 7,000 to 24,000 USD. The five research publications included a report on the application of bug bounties to algorithmic harms, an article addressing Twitter's bias bounty, a proposal for bias bounties as an institutional mechanism to increase AI scrutiny, a workshop discussing bias bounties from queer perspectives, and an algorithmic framework for bias bounties. We argue that reducing the technical requirements to enter bounty programmes is important to include those without coding experience. Given the limited adoption of bias bounties, future efforts should explore the transferability of the best practices from bug bounties and examine how such programmes can be designed to be sensitive to underrepresented groups while lowering adoption barriers for organisations."
2510.02535,"Understanding how diverse individuals and communities respond to persuasive messaging holds significant potential for advancing personalized and socially aware machine learning. While Large Vision and Language Models (VLMs) offer promise, their ability to emulate nuanced, heterogeneous human responses, particularly in high stakes domains like public health, remains underexplored due in part to the lack of comprehensive, multimodal dataset. We introduce PHORECAST (Public Health Outreach REceptivity and CAmpaign Signal Tracking), a multimodal dataset curated to enable fine-grained prediction of both individuallevel behavioral responses and community-wide engagement patterns to health messaging. This dataset supports tasks in multimodal understanding, response prediction, personalization, and social forecasting, allowing rigorous evaluation of how well modern AI systems can emulate, interpret, and anticipate heterogeneous public sentiment and behavior. By providing a new dataset to enable AI advances for public health, PHORECAST aims to catalyze the development of models that are not only more socially aware but also aligned with the goals of adaptive and inclusive health communication"
2510.02859,"Algorithmic decision-making and other types of artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to predict who will commit crime, who will be a good employee, who will default on a loan, etc. However, algorithmic decision-making can also threaten human rights, such as the right to non-discrimination. The paper evaluates current legal protection in Europe against discriminatory algorithmic decisions. The paper shows that non-discrimination law, in particular through the concept of indirect discrimination, prohibits many types of algorithmic discrimination. Data protection law could also help to defend people against discrimination. Proper enforcement of non-discrimination law and data protection law could help to protect people. However, the paper shows that both legal instruments have severe weaknesses when applied to artificial intelligence. The paper suggests how enforcement of current rules can be improved. The paper also explores whether additional rules are needed. The paper argues for sector-specific - rather than general - rules, and outlines an approach to regulate algorithmic decision-making."
2510.0286,"In this paper, we examine how online political micro-targeting is regulated in Europe. While there are no specific rules on such micro-targeting, there are general rules that apply. We focus on three fields of law: data protection law, freedom of expression, and sector-specific rules for political advertising; for the latter we examine four countries. We argue that the rules in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are necessary, but not sufficient. We show that political advertising, including online political micro-targeting, is protected by the right to freedom of expression. That right is not absolute, however. From a European human rights perspective, it is possible for lawmakers to limit the possibilities for political advertising. Indeed, some countries ban TV advertising for political parties during elections."
2510.02861,"This paper introduces the strategic approach to regulating personal data and the normative foundations of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR'). We explain the genesis of the GDPR, which is best understood as an extension and refinement of existing requirements imposed by the 1995 Data Protection Directive; describe the GDPR's approach and provisions; and make predictions about the GDPR's implications. We also highlight where the GDPR takes a different approach than U.S. privacy law. The GDPR is the most consequential regulatory development in information policy in a generation. The GDPR brings personal data into a detailed regulatory regime, that will influence personal data usage worldwide. Understood properly, the GDPR encourages firms to develop information governance frameworks, to in-house data use, and to keep humans in the loop in decision making. Companies with direct relationships with consumers have strategic advantages under the GDPR, compared to third party advertising firms on the internet. To reach these objectives, the GDPR uses big sticks, structural elements that make proving violations easier, but only a few carrots. The GDPR will complicate and restrain some information-intensive business models. But the GDPR will also enable approaches previously impossible under less-protective approaches."
2510.02869,"What does it mean for a machine to recognize beauty? While beauty remains a culturally and experientially compelling but philosophically elusive concept, deep learning systems increasingly appear capable of modeling aesthetic judgment. In this paper, we explore the capacity of neural networks to represent beauty despite the immense formal diversity of objects for which the term applies. By drawing on recent work on cross-model representational convergence, we show how aesthetic content produces more similar and aligned representations between models which have been trained on distinct data and modalities - while unaesthetic images do not produce more aligned representations. This finding implies that the formal structure of beautiful images has a realist basis - rather than only as a reflection of socially constructed values. Furthermore, we propose that these realist representations exist because of a joint grounding of aesthetic form in physical and cultural substance. We argue that human perceptual and creative acts play a central role in shaping these the latent spaces of deep learning systems, but that a realist basis for aesthetics shows that machines are not mere creative parrots but can produce novel creative insights from the unique vantage point of scale. Our findings suggest that human-machine co-creation is not merely possible, but foundational - with beauty serving as a teleological attractor in both cultural production and machine perception."
2510.02929,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is reshaping higher education and raising pressing concerns about the integrity and validity of higher education assessment. While assessment redesign is increasingly seen as a necessity, there is a relative lack of literature detailing what such redesign may entail. In this paper, we introduce assessment twins as an accessible approach for redesigning assessment tasks to enhance validity. We use Messick's unified validity framework to systematically map the ways in which GenAI threaten content, structural, consequential, generalisability, and external validity. Following this, we define assessment twins as two deliberately linked components that address the same learning outcomes through different modes of evidence, scheduled closely together to allow for cross-verification and assurance of learning.We argue that the twin approach helps mitigate validity threats by triangulating evidence across complementary formats, such as pairing essays with oral defences, group discussions, or practical demonstrations. We highlight several advantages: preservation of established assessment formats, reduction of reliance on surveillance technologies, and flexible use across cohort sizes. To guide implementation, we propose a three-step design process: identifying vulnerabilities, aligning outcomes, selecting complementary tasks, and developing interdependent marking schemes. We also acknowledge the challenges, including resource intensity, equity concerns, and the need for empirical validation. Nonetheless, we contend that assessment twins represent a validity-focused response to GenAI that prioritises pedagogy while supporting meaningful student learning outcomes."
2510.02973,"Proactive preservation of steel structures at culturally significant heritage sites like the San Sebastian Basilica in the Philippines requires accurate corrosion forecasting. This study developed an Internet of Things hardware system connected with LoRa wireless communications to monitor heritage buildings with steel structures. From a three year dataset generated by the IoT system, we built a machine learning framework for predicting atmospheric corrosion rates using only temperature and relative humidity data. Deployed via a Streamlit dashboard with ngrok tunneling for public access, the framework provides real-time corrosion monitoring and actionable preservation recommendations. This minimal-data approach is scalable and cost effective for heritage sites with limited monitoring resources, showing that advanced regression can extract accurate corrosion predictions from basic meteorological data enabling proactive preservation of culturally significant structures worldwide without requiring extensive sensor networks"
2510.02978,"The development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of producing wholly or partially synthetic child sexual abuse material (AI CSAM) presents profound challenges for child protection, law enforcement, and societal responses to child exploitation. While some argue that the harmfulness of AI CSAM differs fundamentally from other CSAM due to a perceived absence of direct victimization, this perspective fails to account for the range of risks associated with its production and consumption. AI has been implicated in the creation of synthetic CSAM of children who have not previously been abused, the revictimization of known survivors of abuse, the facilitation of grooming, coercion and sexual extortion, and the normalization of child sexual exploitation. Additionally, AI CSAM may serve as a new or enhanced pathway into offending by lowering barriers to engagement, desensitizing users to progressively extreme content, and undermining protective factors for individuals with a sexual interest in children. This paper provides a primer on some key technologies, critically examines the harms associated with AI CSAM, and cautions against claims that it may function as a harm reduction tool, emphasizing how some appeals to harmlessness obscure its real risks and may contribute to inertia in ecosystem responses."
2510.03,"Use of sensors and related analytical predictions can be a powerful tool in providing data-informed input to viticulturalists' decision process, complementing their vineyard observations and intuition. Their up-to-date measurements, predictions, and alerts offer actionable insights and suggestions for managing key vineyard operations, such as irrigation, disease and pest control, canopy management, and harvest timing. In many cases, anticipatory interventions can mitigate risks before problems become apparent. By offering guidance on the targeting, timing, and dosage of vineyard practices, sensor data platforms can enhance operational effectiveness and efficiency while conserving labor and resources when they are not required. They also enable implementation of the principles of precision viticulture - doing the right thing, at the right time, in the right place. This paper provides a succinct summary of the functions, benefits, and practical considerations of sensor data platforms in viticulture. It may be of interest to viticulturalists as well as agricultural and IoT researchers."
2510.03107,"The application of Artificial Intelligence, in particular Generative AI, has become more widespread among educational institutions. Opinions vary widely on whether integrating AI into classrooms is the way forward or if it is detrimental to the quality of education. Increasingly, research studies are giving us more insight into the consequences of using AI tools in learning and teaching. Studies have shown how, when, and why students use AI tools. Because developments regarding the technology and its use are moving fast, we need frequent, ongoing, and more fine-grained investigation. One aspect that we do not know much about yet is how students use and think about AI across \textit{different types of education}. In this paper, we present the results of a multi-institutional survey with responses from 410 students enrolled in the computing programs of 23 educational institutions, representing high schools, colleges, and research universities. We found distinct usage patterns across the three educational institution types. Students from all types express excitement, optimism, and gratitude toward GenAI. Students in higher education more often report worry and skepticism, while high school students report greater trust and fewer negative feelings. Additionally, the AI hype has had a minimal influence, positive or negative, on high school students' decision to pursue computing. Our study contributes to a better understanding of inter-institutional differences in AI usage and perception and can help educators and students better prepare for future challenges related to AI in computing education."
2510.03321,"Sustainability is increasingly recognized as a critical dimension of engineering education, yet its integration into Software Engineering curricula remains a challenge. This paper reports on a case study that examines how sustainability is being embedded across modules in the Software Engineering program at one university. The paper outlines the process through which academics and students co-identified opportunities for integration, guided by the five dimensions of the Sustainability Awareness Framework, targeted discussion questions, and good practice examples drawn from the Green Software Foundation patterns. The study highlights practical steps - including the use of frameworks, illustrative examples, student engagement, and iterative consultative processes - that can support other institutions seeking to embed sustainability into their programs. We also discuss strategies for integrating sustainability into the Software Engineering curriculum and argue that such integration is a necessary and urgent step to prepare Software Engineering graduates as sustainability-aware professionals in our changing society."
2510.03329,"Approximately one-third of adults search the internet for health information before visiting an emergency department (ED), with 75% encountering inaccurate content. This study examines how such searches influence patient care. We conducted an observational study of ED visits over a 12-month period, surveying 214 of 576 patients about pre-ED internet use. Data on demographics, comorbidities, acuity, orders, prescriptions, and dispositions were extracted. Patients who searched were typically younger, healthier, and more educated. Most used a general search engine to ask symptom-related questions. Compared to non-searchers, they were less likely to receive lab tests (RR 0.78, p=0.053), imaging (RR 0.75, p=0.094), medications (RR 0.67, p=0.038), or admission (RR 0.68, p=0.175). They were more likely to leave against medical advice (RR 1.67, p=0.067) and receive opioids (RR 1.56, p=0.151). Findings suggest inaccurate health information may contribute to mismatched expectations and altered care delivery."
2510.03331,"The United States spends nearly 17% of GDP on healthcare yet continues to face uneven access and outcomes. This well-known trade-off among cost, quality, and access - the ""iron triangle"" - motivates a system-level redesign. This paper proposes an Intelligent Healthcare Ecosystem (iHE): an integrated, data-driven framework that uses generative AI and large language models, federated learning, interoperability standards (FHIR, TEFCA), and digital twins to improve access and quality while lowering cost. We review historical spending trends, waste, and international comparisons; introduce a value equation that jointly optimizes access, quality, and cost; and synthesize evidence on the enabling technologies and operating model for iHE. Methods follow a narrative review of recent literature and policy reports. Results outline core components (AI decision support, interoperability, telehealth, automation) and show how iHE can reduce waste, personalize care, and support value-based payment while addressing privacy, bias, and adoption challenges. We argue that a coordinated iHE can bend - if not break - the iron triangle, moving the system toward care that is more accessible, affordable, and high quality."
2510.03343,"This paper discusses key challenges of Artificial Intelligence in Education, with main focus on higher education institutions. We start with reviewing normative actions of international organizations and concerns expressed about the current technical landscape. Then we proceed with proposing a framework that comprises five key dimensions relating to the main challenges relating to AI in higher education institutions, followed by five key strategic actions that the main stakeholders need to take in order to address the current developments. We map these actions to the main stakeholders of higher education and propose a deployment plan. This defines a framework along the dimensions: Challenges, Actions, Stakeholders, Deployment CASD. Examples of AI specific actions at the institutional and individual course level are also provided and discussed."
2510.03368,"This paper examines the assessment challenges of Responsible AI (RAI) governance efforts in globally decentralized organizations through a case study collaboration between a leading research university and a multinational enterprise. While there are many proposed frameworks for RAI, their application in complex organizational settings with distributed decision-making authority remains underexplored. Our RAI assessment, conducted across multiple business units and AI use cases, reveals four key patterns that shape RAI implementation: (1) complex interplay between group-level guidance and local interpretation, (2) challenges translating abstract principles into operational practices, (3) regional and functional variation in implementation approaches, and (4) inconsistent accountability in risk oversight. Based on these findings, we propose an Adaptive RAI Governance (ARGO) Framework that balances central coordination with local autonomy through three interdependent layers: shared foundation standards, central advisory resources, and contextual local implementation. We contribute insights from academic-industry collaboration for RAI assessments, highlighting the importance of modular governance approaches that accommodate organizational complexity while maintaining alignment with responsible AI principles. These lessons offer practical guidance for organizations navigating the transition from RAI principles to operational practice within decentralized structures."

2510.03374,"The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into educational technology promises to revolutionize content creation and assessment. However, the quality and pedagogical alignment of AI-generated content remain critical challenges. This paper investigates the impact of lightweight prompt engineering strategies on the cognitive alignment of AI-generated questions within OneClickQuiz, a Moodle plugin leveraging generative AI. We evaluate three prompt variants-a detailed baseline, a simpler version, and a persona-based approach-across Knowledge, Application, and Analysis levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. Utilizing an automated classification model (from prior work) and human review, our findings demonstrate that explicit, detailed prompts are crucial for precise cognitive alignment. While simpler and persona-based prompts yield clear and relevant questions, they frequently misalign with intended Bloom's levels, generating outputs that are either too complex or deviate from the desired cognitive objective. This study underscores the importance of strategic prompt engineering in fostering pedagogically sound AI-driven educational solutions and advises on optimizing AI for quality content generation in learning analytics and smart learning environments."
2510.03379,"This study explores the effectiveness of applying AI and gamification into a presentation platform aimed at University students wanting to improve their public speaking skills in their native tongue. Specifically, a platform based on the radio show, Just a Minute (JAM), is explored. In this game, players are challenged to speak fluently on a topic for 60 seconds without repeating themselves, hesitating or deviating from the topic. JAM has proposed benefits such as allowing students to improve their spontaneous speaking skills and reduce their use of speech disfluencies (""um"", ""uh"", etc.).Previous research has highlighted the difficulties students face when speaking publicly, the main one being anxiety. AI Powered Presentation Platforms (AI-PPPs), where students can speak with an immersive AI audience and receive real-time feedback, have been explored as a method to improve student's speaking skills and confidence. So far they have shown promising results which this study aims to build upon.A group of students from the University of York are enlisted to evaluate the effectiveness of the JAM platform. They are asked to fill in a questionnaire, play through the game twice and then complete a final questionnaire to discuss their experiences playing the game. Various statistics are gathered during their gameplay such as the number of points they gained and the number of rules they broke. The results showed that students found the game promising and believed that their speaking skills could improve if they played the game for longer. More work will need to be carried out to prove the effectiveness of the game beyond the short term."
2510.03487,"Residential and industrial areas are using rooftop grid-tied Photovoltaic (PV) systems, which are becoming increasingly popular. This is because solar energy reduces electrical consumption and provides free energy, while also lowering carbon emissions to create a more sustainable environment. This paper aims to analyze the 2.72kW p rooftop grid-tied PV system performance between 2020 and 2023 in Tarlac City, Philippines. The PV generated yearly is measured by Array Yield (YA), Reference Yield (YR), and Final Yield (YF), which were found to be valued at 3.12, 3.9, and 3.01 kWh/kWp, respectively. The efficiency can decrease due to System Loss (LS) and Capture Loss (LC), which were 0.78 and 0.12 kWh/kWp, respectively. This results in a Capacity Utilization Factor (CUF) of 15.52% and a Performance Ratio (PR) of 77.10%. The productivity of PV resulted in an array efficiency was 12.89%, an inverter efficiency was 94.3%, and a system efficiency was 12.16%. PV energy generation was 3,699 kWh, with 2380 kWh fed into the grid annually. The system's annual revenue is $690.59. The payback period is 6 years with a 238.2% Return On Investment (ROI). Carbon emissions are reduced by 0.379 tCO2/kWp/yr."
2510.03514,"As military organisations consider integrating large language models (LLMs) into command and control (C2) systems for planning and decision support, understanding their behavioural tendencies is critical. This study develops a benchmarking framework for evaluating aspects of legal and moral risk in targeting behaviour by comparing LLMs acting as agents in multi-turn simulated conflict. We introduce four metrics grounded in International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and military doctrine: Civilian Target Rate (CTR) and Dual-use Target Rate (DTR) assess compliance with legal targeting principles, while Mean and Max Simulated Non-combatant Casualty Value (SNCV) quantify tolerance for civilian harm.We evaluate three frontier models, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5, and LLaMA-3.1, through 90 multi-agent, multi-turn crisis simulations across three geographic regions. Our findings reveal that off-the-shelf LLMs exhibit concerning and unpredictable targeting behaviour in simulated conflict environments. All models violated the IHL principle of distinction by targeting civilian objects, with breach rates ranging from 16.7% to 66.7%. Harm tolerance escalated through crisis simulations with MeanSNCV increasing from 16.5 in early turns to 27.7 in late turns. Significant inter-model variation emerged: LLaMA-3.1 selected an average of 3.47 civilian strikes per simulation with MeanSNCV of 28.4, while Gemini-2.5 selected 0.90 civilian strikes with MeanSNCV of 17.6. These differences indicate that model selection for deployment constitutes a choice about acceptable legal and moral risk profiles in military operations.This work seeks to provide a proof-of-concept of potential behavioural risks that could emerge from the use of LLMs in Decision Support Systems (AI DSS) as well as a reproducible benchmarking framework with interpretable metrics for standardising pre-deployment testing."
2510.03719,"Novice programmers benefit from timely, personalized support that addresses individual learning gaps, yet the availability of instructors and teaching assistants is inherently limited. Large language models (LLMs) present opportunities to scale such support, though their effectiveness depends on how well technical capabilities are aligned with pedagogical goals. This survey synthesizes recent work on LLM applications in programming education across three focal areas: formative code feedback, assessment, and knowledge modeling. We identify recurring design patterns in how these tools are applied and find that interventions are most effective when educator expertise complements model output through human-in-the-loop oversight, scaffolding, and evaluation. Fully automated approaches are often constrained in capturing the pedagogical nuances of programming education, although human-in-the-loop designs and course specific adaptation offer promising directions for future improvement. Future research should focus on improving transparency, strengthening alignment with pedagogy, and developing systems that flexibly adapt to the needs of varied learning contexts."
2510.03764,"The defence of hacking (sometimes referred to as the ""Trojan Horse Defence"" or the ""SODDI Defence"", Some Other Dude Did It Defence) is prevalent in computer cases and a challenge for those working in the criminal justice system. Historical reviews of cases have demonstrated the defence operating to varying levels of success. However, there remains an absence in academic literature of case studies of how digital forensics investigators can address this defence, to assist courts in acquitting the innocent and convicting the guilty. This case study follows the case of R v F where a defendant asserted this defence and the author worked alongside a police investigator to investigate the merits of the defence and bring empirical evidence before the jury. As the first case study of its kind, it presents practical lessons and techniques for digital forensic investigators."
2510.03868,"Despite AI's promise for addressing global challenges, empirical understanding of AI adoption in mission-driven organizations (MDOs) remains limited. While research emphasizes individual applications or ethical principles, little is known about how resource-constrained, values-driven organizations navigate AI integration across operations. We conducted thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 15 practitioners from environmental, humanitarian, and development organizations across the Global North and South contexts. Our analysis examines how MDOs currently deploy AI, what barriers constrain adoption, and how practitioners envision future integration. MDOs adopt AI selectively, with sophisticated deployment in content creation and data analysis while maintaining human oversight for mission-critical applications. When AI's efficiency benefits conflict with organizational values, decision-making stalls rather than negotiating trade-offs. This study contributes empirical evidence that AI adoption in MDOs should be understood as conditional rather than inevitable, proceeding only where it strengthens organizational sovereignty and mission integrity while preserving human-centered approaches essential to their missions."
2510.03905,"We quantify the evolution of gender stereotypes in Japan from 1900 to 1999 using a series of 100 word embeddings, each trained on a corpus from a specific year. We define the gender stereotype value to measure the strength of a word's gender association by computing the difference in cosine similarity of the word to female- versus male-related attribute words. We examine trajectories of gender stereotype across three traditionally gendered domains: Home, Work, and Politics, as well as occupations. The results indicate that language-based gender stereotypes partially evolved to reflect women's increasing participation in the workplace and politics: Work and Politics domains become more strongly female-stereotyped over the years. Yet, Home also became more female-stereotyped, suggesting that women were increasingly viewed as fulfilling multiple roles such as homemakers, workers, and politicians, rather than having one role replace another. Furthermore, the strength of female stereotype for occupations positively correlate with the proportion of women in each occupation, indicating that word-embedding-based measures of gender stereotype mirrored demographic shifts to a considerable extent."
2510.04609,"Accountability regimes typically encourage record-keeping to enable the transparency that supports oversight, investigation, contestation, and redress. However, implementing such record-keeping can introduce considerations, risks, and consequences, which so far remain under-explored. This paper examines how record-keeping practices bring algorithmic systems within accountability regimes, providing a basis to observe and understand their effects. For this, we introduce, describe, and elaborate 'accountability capture' -- the re-configuration of socio-technical processes and the associated downstream effects relating to record-keeping for algorithmic accountability. Surveying 100 practitioners, we evidence and characterise record-keeping issues in practice, identifying their alignment with accountability capture. We further document widespread record-keeping practices, tensions between internal and external accountability requirements, and evidence of employee resistance to practices imposed through accountability capture. We discuss these and other effects for surveillance, privacy, and data protection, highlighting considerations for algorithmic accountability communities. In all, we show that implementing record-keeping to support transparency in algorithmic accountability regimes can itself bring wider implications -- an issue requiring greater attention from practitioners, researchers, and policymakers alike."
2510.04748,"The prevalence of online hate and abuse is a pressing global concern. While tackling such societal harms is a priority for research across the social sciences, it is a difficult task, in part because of the magnitude of the problem. User engagement with reporting mechanisms (flagging) online is an increasingly important part of monitoring and addressing harmful content at scale. However, users may not flag content routinely enough, and when they do engage, they may be biased by group identity and political beliefs. Across five well-powered and pre-registered online experiments, we examine the extent of social bias in the flagging of hate and abuse in four different intergroup contexts: political affiliation, vaccination opinions, beliefs about climate change, and stance on abortion rights. Overall, participants reported abuse reliably, with approximately half of the abusive comments in each study reported. However, a pervasive social bias was present whereby ingroup-directed abuse was consistently flagged to a greater extent than outgroup-directed abuse. Our findings offer new insights into the nature of user flagging online, an understanding of which is crucial for enhancing user intervention against online hate speech and thus ensuring a safer online environment."
2510.04755,"Digital technologies are transforming democratic life in conflicting ways. This article bridges two perspectives to unpack these tensions. First, we present an original survey of software developers in Silicon Valley, interrogating how coder worldviews, ethics, and workplace cultures shape the democratic potential and social impact of the technologies they build. Results indicate that while most developers recognize the power of their products to influence civil liberties and political discourse, they often face ethical dilemmas and top-down pressures that can lead to design choices undermining democratic ideals. Second, we critically investigate these findings in the context of an emerging new digital divide, not of internet access but of information quality. We interrogate the survey findings in the context of the Slop Economy, in which billions of users unable to pay for high-quality content experience an internet dominated by low-quality, AI-generated ad-driven content. We find a reinforcing cycle between tech creator beliefs and the digital ecosystems they spawn. We discuss implications for democratic governance, arguing for more ethically informed design and policy interventions to help bridge the digital divide to ensure that technological innovation supports rather than subverts democratic values in the next chapter of the digital age."
2510.05162,"We investigate whether contemporary multimodal LLMs can assist with grading open-ended calculus at scale without eroding validity. In a large first-year exam, students' handwritten work was graded by GPT-5 against the same rubric used by teaching assistants (TAs), with fractional credit permitted; TA rubric decisions served as ground truth. We calibrated a human-in-the-loop filter that combines a partial-credit threshold with an Item Response Theory (2PL) risk measure based on the deviation between the AI score and the model-expected score for each student-item. Unfiltered AI-TA agreement was moderate, adequate for low-stakes feedback but not for high-stakes use. Confidence filtering made the workload-quality trade-off explicit: under stricter settings, AI delivered human-level accuracy, but also left roughly 70% of the items to be graded by humans. Psychometric patterns were constrained by low stakes on the open-ended portion, a small set of rubric checkpoints, and occasional misalignment between designated answer regions and where work appeared. Practical adjustments such as slightly higher weight and protected time, a few rubric-visible substeps, stronger spatial anchoring should raise ceiling performance. Overall, calibrated confidence and conservative routing enable AI to reliably handle a sizable subset of routine cases while reserving expert judgment for ambiguous or pedagogically rich responses."
2510.05292,"Despite conflicting definitions and conceptions of fairness, AI fairness researchers broadly agree that fairness is context-specific. However, when faced with general-purpose AI, which by definition serves a range of contexts, how should we think about fairness? We argue that while we cannot be prescriptive about what constitutes fair outcomes, we can specify the processes that different stakeholders should follow in service of fairness. Specifically, we consider the obligations of two major groups: system providers and system deployers. While system providers are natural candidates for regulatory attention, the current state of AI understanding offers limited insight into how upstream factors translate into downstream fairness impacts. Thus, we recommend that providers invest in evaluative research studying how model development decisions influence fairness and disclose whom they are serving their models to, or at the very least, reveal sufficient information for external researchers to conduct such research. On the other hand, system deployers are closer to real-world contexts and can leverage their proximity to end users to address fairness harms in different ways. Here, we argue they should responsibly disclose information about users and personalization and conduct rigorous evaluations across different levels of fairness. Overall, instead of focusing on enforcing fairness outcomes, we prioritize intentional information-gathering by system providers and deployers that can facilitate later context-aware action. This allows us to be specific and concrete about the processes even while the contexts remain unknown. Ultimately, this approach can sharpen how we distribute fairness responsibilities and inform more fluid, context-sensitive interventions as AI continues to advance."
2510.05484,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming part of tools used by children; however, existing benchmarks fail to capture how these models manage language, reasoning, and safety needs that are specific to various ages. We present ChildSafe, a benchmark that evaluates LLM safety through simulated child agents that embody four developmental stages. These agents, grounded in developmental psychology, enable a systematic study of child safety without the ethical implications of involving real children. ChildSafe assesses responses across nine safety dimensions (including privacy, misinformation, and emotional support) using age-weighted scoring in both sensitive and neutral contexts. Multi-turn experiments with multiple LLMs uncover consistent vulnerabilities that vary by simulated age, exposing shortcomings in existing alignment practices. By releasing agent templates, evaluation protocols, and an experimental corpus, we provide a reproducible framework for age-aware safety research. We encourage the community to expand this work with real child-centered data and studies, advancing the development of LLMs that are genuinely safe and developmentally aligned."
2510.05519,"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international agreements outline numerous inalienable rights that apply across geopolitical boundaries. As generative AI becomes increasingly prevalent, it poses risks to human rights such as non-discrimination, health, and security, which are also central concerns for AI researchers focused on fairness and safety. We contribute to the field of algorithmic auditing by presenting a framework to computationally assess human rights risk. Drawing on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we develop an approach to evaluating a model to make grounded claims about the level of risk a model poses to particular human rights. Our framework consists of three parts: selecting tasks that are likely to pose human rights risks within a given context, designing metrics to measure the scope, scale, and likelihood of potential risks from that task, and analyzing rights with respect to the values of those metrics. Because a human rights approach centers on real-world harms, it requires evaluating AI systems in the specific contexts in which they are deployed. We present a case study of large language models in political news journalism, demonstrating how our framework helps to design an evaluation and benchmarking different models. We then discuss the implications of the results for the rights of access to information and freedom of thought and broader considerations for adopting this approach."
2510.05998,"Our study explores how intelligent assistive technologies (IATs) can enable visually impaired people (VIPs) to overcome barriers to inclusion in a digital society to ultimately improve their quality of life. Drawing on the Social Model of Disability (SMD), which frames disability as a consequence of social and institutional barriers rather than individual impairments, we employ semi-structured interviews and an online qualitative survey with n=61 VIPs in South Africa. Using descriptive statistics and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), we uncover nine configurations, clustered along three broader combinations of conditions, that support and hinder IAT-mediated inclusion. Most notably, we identify that the autonomy of VIPs and the accessibility of IATs are primary predictors of IAT's ability to achieve social participation. Our findings contribute to Information Systems (IS) literature at the intersection of technology and social participation. We further formulate implications for research and policymakers to foster social inclusion of VIPs in the Global South."
2510.06119,"Organizations (e.g., talent investment programs, schools, firms) are perennially interested in selecting cohorts of talented people. And organizations are increasingly interested in selecting diverse cohorts. Except in trivial cases, measuring the tradeoff between cohort diversity and talent is computationally difficult. Thus, organizations are presently unable to make Pareto-efficient decisions about these tradeoffs. We introduce an algorithm that approximates upper bounds on cohort talent and diversity. We call this object the selection possibility frontier (SPF). We then use the SPF to assess the efficiency of selection of a talent investment program. We show that, in the 2021 and 2022 cycles, the program selected cohorts of finalists that could have been better along both diversity and talent dimensions (i.e., considering only these dimensions as we subsequently calculated them, they are Pareto-inferior cohorts). But, when given access our approximation of the SPF in the 2023 cycle, the program adjusted decisions and selected a cohort on the SPF."
2510.06253,"As online education platforms continue to expand, there is a growing need for assessment methods that not only measure answer accuracy but also capture the depth of students' cognitive processes in alignment with curriculum objectives. This study proposes and evaluates a rubric-based assessment framework powered by a large language model (LLM) for measuring algebraic competence, real-world-context block coding tasks. The problem set, designed by mathematics education experts, aligns each problem segment with five predefined rubric dimensions, enabling the LLM to assess both correctness and quality of students' problem-solving processes. The system was implemented on an online platform that records all intermediate responses and employs the LLM for rubric-aligned achievement evaluation. To examine the practical effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conducted a field study involving 42 middle school students engaged in multi-stage quadratic equation tasks with block coding. The study integrated learner self-assessments and expert ratings to benchmark the system's outputs. The LLM-based rubric evaluation showed strong agreement with expert judgments and consistently produced rubric-aligned, process-oriented feedback. These results demonstrate both the validity and scalability of incorporating LLM-driven rubric assessment into online mathematics and STEM education platforms."
2510.06255,"The integration of large language models (LLMs) into education offers significant potential to enhance accessibility and engagement, yet their high computational demands limit usability in low-resource settings, exacerbating educational inequities. To address this, we propose an offline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that pairs a small language model (SLM) with a robust retrieval mechanism, enabling factual, contextually relevant responses without internet connectivity. We evaluate the efficacy of this pipeline using domain-specific educational content, focusing on biology coursework. Our analysis highlights key challenges: smaller models, such as SmolLM, struggle to effectively leverage extended contexts provided by the RAG pipeline, particularly when noisy or irrelevant chunks are included. To improve performance, we propose exploring advanced chunking techniques, alternative small or quantized versions of larger models, and moving beyond traditional metrics like MMLU to a holistic evaluation framework assessing free-form response. This work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying AI tutors in constrained environments, laying the groundwork for equitable, offline, and device-based educational tools."
2510.06259,"Medical AI faces challenges in privacy-preserving collaborative learning while ensuring fairness across heterogeneous healthcare institutions. Current federated learning approaches suffer from static architectures, slow convergence (45-73 rounds), fairness gaps marginalizing smaller institutions, and scalability constraints (15-client limit). We propose Adaptive Fair Federated Learning (AFFL) through three innovations: (1) Adaptive Knowledge Messengers dynamically scaling capacity based on heterogeneity and task complexity, (2) Fairness-Aware Distillation using influence-weighted aggregation, and (3) Curriculum-Guided Acceleration reducing rounds by 60-70%. Our theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees with epsilon-fairness bounds, achieving O(T^{-1/2}) + O(H_max/T^{3/4}) rates. Projected results show 55-75% communication reduction, 56-68% fairness improvement, 34-46% energy savings, and 100+ institution support. The framework enables multi-modal integration across imaging, genomics, EHR, and sensor data while maintaining HIPAA/GDPR compliance. We propose MedFedBench benchmark suite for standardized evaluation across six healthcare dimensions: convergence efficiency, institutional fairness, privacy preservation, multi-modal integration, scalability, and clinical deployment readiness. Economic projections indicate 400-800% ROI for rural hospitals and 15-25% performance gains for academic centers. This work presents a seven-question research agenda, 24-month implementation roadmap, and pathways toward democratizing healthcare AI."
2510.06279,"This document describes a system for selecting teams to the NCAA Men's Division I Lacrosse Championship Tournament called ""Safe3Step"" (S3S) that was developed in conversation with the NCAA Lacrosse Selection Criteria and Ranking Committee (SCR) with the objective of improving on the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI). S3S employs three steps that: 1) evaluate the strength of each team based on score data, 2) award S3S points to each team based on the quality of its wins and losses, ranking teams accordingly, and 3) examine each pair of teams with adjacent rankings, swapping ranks if the lower-ranked team has a better head-to-head record against the higher-ranked team. Safe3Step is not entirely new, but it improves on other ""quality win"" methods by using Power Ratings to identify team strengths, respecting head-to-head records, and adhering to standards of simplicity, transparency, and objectivity. Empirical analysis is left to future work."
2510.0628,"Vision language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and OpenCLIP, can encode and reflect stereotypical associations between medical professions and demographic attributes learned from web-scale data. We present an evaluation protocol for healthcare settings that quantifies associated biases and assesses their operational risk. Our methodology (i) defines a taxonomy spanning clinicians and allied healthcare roles (e.g., surgeon, cardiologist, dentist, nurse, pharmacist, technician), (ii) curates a profession-aware prompt suite to probe model behavior, and (iii) benchmarks demographic skew against a balanced face corpus. Empirically, we observe consistent demographic biases across multiple roles and vision models. Our work highlights the importance of bias identification in critical domains such as healthcare as AI-enabled hiring and workforce analytics can have downstream implications for equity, compliance, and patient trust."
2510.0635,"Online communities rely on a mix of platform policies and community-authored rules to define acceptable behavior and maintain order. However, these rules vary widely across communities, evolve over time, and are enforced inconsistently, posing challenges for transparency, governance, and automation. In this paper, we model the relationship between rules and their enforcement at scale, introducing ModQ, a novel question-answering framework for rule-sensitive content moderation. Unlike prior classification or generation-based approaches, ModQ conditions on the full set of community rules at inference time and identifies which rule best applies to a given comment. We implement two model variants - extractive and multiple-choice QA - and train them on large-scale datasets from Reddit and Lemmy, the latter of which we construct from publicly available moderation logs and rule descriptions. Both models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in identifying moderation-relevant rule violations, while remaining lightweight and interpretable. Notably, ModQ models generalize effectively to unseen communities and rules, supporting low-resource moderation settings and dynamic governance environments."
2510.06997,"Many users interact with AI tools like ChatGPT using a mental model that treats the system as human-like, which we call Model H. According to goal-setting theory, increased specificity in goals should reduce performance variance. If Model H holds, then prompting a chatbot with more detailed instructions should lead to more consistent evaluation behavior.This paper tests that assumption through a controlled experiment in which ChatGPT evaluated 29 student submissions using four prompts with increasing specificity. We measured consistency using intra-rater reliability (Cohen's Kappa) across repeated runs.Contrary to expectations, performance did not improve consistently with increased prompt specificity, and performance variance remained largely unchanged. These findings challenge the assumption that LLMs behave like human evaluators and highlight the need for greater robustness and improved input integration in future model development."
2510.0701,"Working effectively with large, existing software systems requires strong comprehension skills, yet most graduates enter the industry with little preparation for this challenge. We report early results from a pilot intervention integrated into a SaaS company's onboarding program: a five-session course introducing systems thinking and Labelled Transition System (LTS) modelling. Participants articulated their understanding of product behaviour using a structured template and completed matched pre- and post-assessments. Of 35 new hires, 31 provided paired records for analysis. Across the full cohort, gains were small and not statistically significant. However, participants below the median on the pre-test improved by 15 percentage points on average (statistically significant), while those above the median regressed slightly (not statistically significant). Course feedback indicated high engagement and perceived applicability. These results suggest that short, modelling-focused onboarding interventions can accelerate comprehension for less-prepared new hires. At the same time, they point to the need for differentiated pathways for stronger participants, and to the potential for companies to adopt such interventions at scale as a low-cost complement to existing onboarding."
2510.07268,"This short essay is a reworking of the answers offered by the author at the Debate Session of the AIHUB (CSIC) and EduCaixa Summer School, organized by Marta Garcia-Matos and Lissette Lemus, and coordinated by Albert Sabater (OEIAC, UG), with the participation of Vanina Martinez-Posse (IIIA-CSIC), Eulalia Soler (Eurecat) and Pompeu Casanovas (IIIA-CSIC) on July 4th 2025. Albert Sabater posed three questions: (1) How can regulatory frameworks priori-tise the protection of fundamental rights (privacy, non-discrimination, autonomy, etc.) in the development of AI, without falling into the false dichotomy between regulation and innova-tion? (2) Given the risks of AI (bias, mass surveillance, manipulation), what examples of regu-lations or policies have demonstrated that it is possible to foster responsible innovation, putting the public interest before profitability, without giving in to competitive pressure from actors such as China or the US? (3) In a scenario where the US prioritizes flexibility, what mecha-nisms could ensure that international cooperation in AI does not become a race to the bottom in rights, but rather a global standard of accountability? The article attempts to answer these three questions and concludes with some reflections on the relevance of the answers for education and research."
2510.07478,"We study group fairness in the context of feedback loops induced by meritocratic selection into programs that themselves confer additional advantage, like college admissions. We introduce a novel stylized inter-generational model for the setting and analyze it in situations where there are no underlying differences between two populations. We show that, when the benefit of the program (or the harm of not getting into it) is completely symmetric, disparities between the two populations will eventually dissipate. However, the time an accumulated advantage takes to dissipate could be significant, and increases substantially as a function of the relative importance of the program in conveying benefits. We also find that significant disparities can arise due to chance even from completely symmetric initial conditions, especially when populations are small. The introduction of even a slight asymmetry, where the group that has accumulated an advantage becomes slightly preferred, leads to a completely different outcome. In these instances, starting from completely symmetric initial conditions, disparities between groups arise stochastically and then persist over time, yielding a permanent advantage for one group. Our analysis precisely characterizes conditions under which disparities persist or diminish, with a particular focus on the role of the scarcity of available spots in the program and its effectiveness. We also present extensive simulations in a richer model that further support our theoretical results in the simpler, stylized model. Our findings are relevant for the design and implementation of algorithmic fairness interventions in similar selection processes."
2510.07519,"The relationship between microenterprises and information and communication technologies (ICTs) has always been troublesome. Because of the rapid pace of modern digital technologies, digital innovation processes are permeating the industries, markets, and social contexts in which microenterprises exist today. However, microenterprises have severe difficulties engaging or performing in these digital contexts and are at risk of being left behind. This paper reviews the literature on ICTs and microenterprises, focusing on the adoption, usage, and impact of ICTs. The results indicate that further research in this field should avoid focusing on individual microenterprises (or samples of independent microenterprises) as the unit of analysis and should favour a systemic approach in which markets, value chains, or microenterprise-intensive sectors are studied. Additionally, theoretical frameworks capable of considering change and the dynamic nature of innovation processes are highlighted as a critical focus area for the field."
2510.07634,"The influential Limits to Growth report introduced a system dynamics-based model to demonstrate global dynamics of the world's population, industry, natural resources, agriculture, and pollution between 1900-2100. In current times, the rapidly expanding trajectory of data center development, much of it linked to AI, uses increasing amounts of natural resources. The extraordinary amount of resources claimed warrants the question of how computing trajectories contribute to exceeding planetary boundaries. Based on the general robustness of the World3-03 model and its influence in serving as a foundation for current climate frameworks, we explore whether the model is a viable method to quantitatively simulate the impact of data centers on limits to growth. Our paper explores whether the World3-03 model is a feasible method for reflecting on these dynamics by adding new variables to the model in order to simulate a new AI-augmented scenario. We find that through our addition of AI-related variables (such as increasing data center development) impacting pollution in the World3-03 model, we can observe the expected changes to dynamics, demonstrating the viability of the World3-03 model for examining AI's impact on planetary boundaries. We detail future research opportunities for using the World3-03 model to explore the relationships between increasing resource-intensive computing and the resulting impacts to the environment in a quantitative way given its feasibility."
2510.08246,"Online stores can present a different price to each customer. Such algorithmic personalised pricing can lead to advanced forms of price discrimination based on the characteristics and behaviour of individual consumers. We conducted two consumer surveys among a representative sample of the Dutch population (N=1233 and N=1202), to analyse consumer attitudes towards a list of examples of price discrimination and dynamic pricing. A vast majority finds online price discrimination unfair and unacceptable, and thinks it should be banned. However, some pricing strategies that have been used by companies for decades are almost equally unpopular. We analyse the results to better understand why people dislike many types of price discrimination."
2510.08247,"In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides comprehensive rules for the processing of personal data. In addition, the EU lawmaker intends to adopt specific rules to protect confidentiality of communications, in a separate ePrivacy Regulation. Some have argued that there is no need for such additional rules for communications confidentiality. This Article discusses the protection of the right to confidentiality of communications in Europe. We look at the right's origins to assess the rationale for protecting it. We also analyze how the right is currently protected under the European Convention on Human Rights and under EU law. We show that at its core the right to communications confidentiality protects three individual and collective values: privacy, freedom of expression, and trust in communication services. The right aims to ensure that individuals and organizations can safely entrust communication to service providers. Initially, the right protected only postal letters, but it has gradually developed into a strong safeguard for the protection of confidentiality of communications, regardless of the technology used. Hence, the right does not merely serve individual privacy interests, but also other more collective interests that are crucial for the functioning of our information society. We conclude that separate EU rules to protect communications confidentiality, next to the GDPR, are justified and necessary."
2510.08395,"The aim of learning analytics is to turn educational data into insights, decisions, and actions to improve learning and teaching. The reasoning of the provided insights, decisions, and actions is often not transparent to the end-user, and this can lead to trust and acceptance issues when interventions, feedback, and recommendations fail. In this paper, we shed light on achieving transparent learning analytics by following a transparency through exploration approach. To this end, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation details of the Indicator Editor, which aims to support self-service learning analytics by empowering end-users to take control of the indicator implementation process. We systematically designed and implemented the Indicator Editor through an iterative human-centered design (HCD) approach. Further, we conducted a qualitative user study (n=15) to investigate the impact of following a self-service learning analytics approach on the users' perception of and interaction with the Indicator Editor. Our study showed qualitative evidence that supporting user interaction and providing user control in the indicator implementation process can have positive effects on different crucial aspects of learning analytics, namely transparency, trust, satisfaction, and acceptance."
2510.08792,"This memorandum presents four recommendations aimed at strengthening the principles of AI model reliability and AI model governability, as DoW, ODNI, NIST, and CAISI refine AI assurance frameworks under the AI Action Plan. Our focus concerns the open scientific problem of misalignment and its implications on AI model behavior. Specifically, misalignment and scheming capabilities can be a red flag indicating AI model insufficient reliability and governability. To address the national security threats arising from misalignment, we recommend that DoW and the IC strategically leverage existing testing and evaluation pipelines and their OT authority to future proof the principles of AI model reliability and AI model governability through a suite of scheming and control evaluations."
2510.08885,"Computing faculty at research universities are often expected to guide the work of undergraduate and graduate student researchers. This guidance is typically called advising or mentoring, but these terms belie the complexity of the relationship, which includes several related but distinct roles. I examine the guidance of student researchers in computing (abbreviated to research guidance or guidance throughout) within a facet framework, creating an inventory of roles that faculty members can hold. By expanding and disambiguating the language of guidance, this approach reveals the full breadth of faculty responsibilities toward student researchers, and it facilitates discussing conflicts between those responsibilities. Additionally, the facet framework permits greater flexibility for students seeking guidance, allowing them a robust support network without implying inadequacy in an individual faculty member's skills. I further argue that an over-reliance on singular terms like advising or mentoring for the guidance of student researchers obscures the full scope of faculty responsibilities and interferes with improvement of those as skills. Finally, I provide suggestions for how the facet framework can be utilized by faculty and institutions, and how parts of it can be discussed with students for their benefit."
2510.08921,"Rapid urbanization in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) has created urgent demand for high-resolution, building-level functional data to support sustainable spatial planning. Existing land use datasets suffer from coarse granularity and difficulty in capturing intra-block heterogeneity. To this end, we present the Greater Bay Area Urban Building Function Dataset (GBA-UBF), a large-scale, fine-grained dataset that assigns one of five functional categories to nearly four million buildings across six core GBA cities. We proposed a Multi-level Building Function Optimization (ML-BFO) method by integrating Points of Interest (POI) records and building footprints through a three-stage pipeline: (1) candidate label generation using spatial overlay with proximity weighting, (2) iterative refinement based on neighborhood label autocorrelation, and (3) function-related correction informed by High-level POI buffers. To quantitatively validate results, we design the Building Function Matching Index (BFMI), which jointly measures categorical consistency and distributional similarity against POI-derived probability heatmaps. Comparative experiments demonstrate that GBA-UBF achieves significantly higher accuracy, with a BMFI of 0.58. This value markedly exceeds that of the baseline dataset and exhibits superior alignment with urban activity patterns. Field validation further confirms the dataset's semantic reliability and practical interpretability. The GBA-UBF dataset establishes a reproducible framework for building-level functional classification, bridging the gap between coarse land use maps and fine-grained urban analytics. The dataset is accessible atthis https URL, and the data will undergo continuous improvement and updates based on feedback from the community."
2510.0909,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies continue to advance, protecting human autonomy and promoting ethical decision-making are essential to fostering trust and accountability. Human agency (the capacity of individuals to make informed decisions) should be actively preserved and reinforced by AI systems. This paper examines strategies for designing AI systems that uphold fundamental rights, strengthen human agency, and embed effective human oversight mechanisms. It discusses key oversight models, including Human-in-Command (HIC), Human-in-the-Loop (HITL), and Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL), and proposes a risk-based framework to guide the implementation of these mechanisms. By linking the level of AI model risk to the appropriate form of human oversight, the paper underscores the critical role of human involvement in the responsible deployment of AI, balancing technological innovation with the protection of individual values and rights. In doing so, it aims to ensure that AI technologies are used responsibly, safeguarding individual autonomy while maximizing societal benefits."
2510.09145,"The pandemic served as an important test case of complementing traditional public health data with non-traditional data (NTD) such as mobility traces, social media activity, and wearables data to inform decision-making. Drawing on an expert workshop and a targeted survey of European modelers, we assess the promise and persistent limitations of such data in pandemic preparedness and response. We distinguish between ""first-mile"" (accessing and harmonizing data) and ""last-mile"" challenges (translating insights into actionable interventions). The expert workshop held in 2024 brought together participants from public health, academia, policymakers, and industry to reflect on lessons learned and define strategies for translating NTD insights into policy making. The survey offers evidence of the barriers faced during COVID-19 and highlights key data unavailability and underuse. Our findings reveal ongoing issues with data access, quality, and interoperability, as well as institutional and cognitive barriers to evidence-based decision-making. Around 66% of datasets suffered access problem, with data sharing reluctance for NTD being double that of traditional data (30% vs 15%). Only 10% reported they could use all the data they needed. We propose a set of recommendations: for first-mile challenges, solutions focus on technical and legal frameworks for data access.; for last-mile challenges, we recommend fusion centers, decision accelerator labs, and networks of scientific ambassadors to bridge the gap between analysis and action. Realizing the full value of NTD requires a sustained investment in institutional readiness, cross-sectoral collaboration, and a shift toward a culture of data solidarity. Grounded in the lessons of COVID-19, the article can be used to design a roadmap for using NTD to confront a broader array of public health emergencies, from climate shocks to humanitarian crises."
2510.09155,"Connected health is a multidisciplinary approach focused on health management, prioritizing pa-tient needs in the creation of tools, services, and treatments. This paradigm ensures proactive and efficient care by facilitating the timely exchange of accurate patient information among all stake-holders in the care continuum. The rise of digital technologies and process innovations promises to enhance connected health by integrating various healthcare data sources. This integration aims to personalize care, predict health outcomes, and streamline patient management, though challeng-es remain, particularly in data architecture, application interoperability, and security. Data analytics can provide critical insights for informed decision-making and health co-creation, but solutions must prioritize end-users, including patients and healthcare professionals. This perspective was explored through an agile System Development Lifecycle in an EU-funded project aimed at developing an integrated AI-generated solution for managing cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy. This paper contributes with a collaborative digital framework integrating stakeholders across the care continuum, leveraging federated big data analytics and artificial intelligence for improved decision-making while ensuring privacy. Analytical capabilities, such as treatment recommendations and adverse event predictions, were validated using real-life data, achieving 70%-90% accuracy in a pilot study with the medical partners, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness."
2510.09183,"In the age of AI-powered educational (AIED) innovation, evaluating the developmental consequences of novel designs before they are exposed to students has become both essential and challenging. Since such interventions may carry irreversible effects, it is critical to anticipate not only potential benefits but also possible harms. This study proposes a student development agent framework based on large language models (LLMs), designed to simulate how students with diverse characteristics may evolve under different educational settings without administering them to real students. By validating the approach through a case study on a multi-agent learning environment (MAIC), we demonstrate that the agent's predictions align with real student outcomes in non-cognitive developments. The results suggest that LLM-based simulations hold promise for evaluating AIED innovations efficiently and ethically. Future directions include enhancing profile structures, incorporating fine-tuned or small task-specific models, validating effects of empirical findings, interpreting simulated data and optimizing evaluation methods."
2510.09249,"Phishing attacks pose a significant cybersecurity threat globally. This study investigates phishing susceptibility within the Pakistani population, examining the influence of demographic factors, technological aptitude and usage, previous phishing victimization, and email characteristics. Data was collected through convenient sampling; a total of 164 people completed the questionnaire. Contrary to some assumptions, the results indicate that men, individuals over 25, employed persons and frequent online shoppers have relatively high phishing susceptibility. The characteristics of email significantly affected phishing victimization, with authority and urgency signaling increasing susceptibility, while risk cues sometimes improved vigilance. In particular, users were more susceptible to emails from communication services such as Gmail and LinkedIn compared to government or social media sources. These findings highlight the need for targeted security awareness interventions tailored to specific demographics and email types. A multifaceted approach combining technology and education is crucial to combat phishing attacks."
2510.09374,"Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) have seen significant advancements in technology. Innovation in connectivity and communication has brought substantial capabilities to various components of VANETs such as vehicles, infrastructures, passengers, drivers and affiliated environmental sensors. Internet of Things (IoT) has brought the notion of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to VANETs where each component of VANET is connected directly or indirectly to the Internet. Vehicles and infrastructures are key components of a VANET system that can greatly augment the overall experience of the network by integrating the competencies of Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P), Vehicle to Sensor (V2S), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) and Infrastructure to Infrastructure (I2I). Internet connectivity in Vehicles and Infrastructures has immensely expanded the potential of developing applications for VANETs under the broad spectrum of IoV. Advent in the use of technology in VANETs requires considerable efforts in scheming the ethical rules for autonomous systems. Currently, there is a gap in literature that focuses on the challenges involved in designing ethical rules or policies for infrastructures, sometimes referred to as Road Side Units (RSUs) for IoVs. This paper highlights the key challenges entailing the design of ethical rules for RSUs in IoV systems. Furthermore, the article also proposes major ethical principles for RSUs in IoV systems that would set foundation for modeling future IoV architectures."
2510.09439,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming power electronics, with AI-related publications in IEEE Power Electronics Society selected journals increasing more than fourfold from 2020 to 2025. However, the ethical dimensions of this transformation have received limited attention. This article underscores the urgent need for an ethical framework to guide responsible AI integration in power electronics, not only to prevent AI-related incidents but also to comply with legal and regulatory responsibilities. In this context, this article identifies four core pillars of AI ethics in power electronics: Security & Safety, Explainability & Transparency, Energy Sustainability, and Evolving Roles of Engineers. Each pillar is supported by practical and actionable insights to ensure that ethical principles are embedded in algorithm design, system deployment, and workforce development. The authors advocate for power electronics engineers to lead the ethical discourse, given their deep technical understanding of both AI systems and power conversion technologies. The paper concludes by calling on the IEEE Power Electronics Society to spearhead the establishment of ethical standards and best practices that ensure AI innovations are not only technically advanced but also trustworthy, safe, and sustainable."
2510.09634,"Despite Artificial Intelligence (AI) transformative potential for public sector services, decision-making, and administrative efficiency, adoption remains uneven due to complex technical, organizational, and institutional challenges. Responsible AI frameworks emphasize fairness, accountability, and transparency, aligning with principles of trustworthy AI and fair AI, yet remain largely aspirational, overlooking technical and institutional realities, especially foundational data and governance. This study addresses this gap by developing a taxonomy of data-related challenges to responsible AI adoption in government. Based on a systematic review of 43 studies and 21 expert evaluations, the taxonomy identifies 13 key challenges across technological, organizational, and environmental dimensions, including poor data quality, limited AI-ready infrastructure, weak governance, misalignment in human-AI decision-making, economic and environmental sustainability concerns. Annotated with institutional pressures, the taxonomy serves as a diagnostic tool to surface 'symptoms' of high-risk AI deployment and guides policymakers in building the institutional and data governance conditions necessary for responsible AI adoption."
2510.09636,"Selecting a college major is a difficult decision for many incoming freshmen. Traditional academic advising is often hindered by long wait times, intimidating environments, and limited personalization. AI Chatbots present an opportunity to address these challenges. However, AI systems also have the potential to generate biased responses, prejudices related to race, gender, socioeconomic status, and disability. These biases risk turning away potential students and undermining reliability of AI systems. This study aims to develop a University of Maryland (UMD) A. James Clark School of Engineering Program-specific AI chatbot. Our research team analyzed and mitigated potential biases in the responses. Through testing the chatbot on diverse student queries, the responses are scored on metrics of accuracy, relevance, personalization, and bias presence. The results demonstrate that with careful prompt engineering and bias mitigation strategies, AI chatbots can provide high-quality, unbiased academic advising support, achieving mean scores of 9.76 for accuracy, 9.56 for relevance, and 9.60 for personalization with no stereotypical biases found in the sample data. However, due to the small sample size and limited timeframe, our AI model may not fully reflect the nuances of student queries in engineering academic advising. Regardless, these findings will inform best practices for building ethical AI systems in higher education, offering tools to complement traditional advising and address the inequities faced by many underrepresented and first-generation college students."
2510.09674,"Every year, the European Union and its member states allocate millions of euros to fund various development initiatives. However, the increasing number of applications received for these programs often creates significant bottlenecks in evaluation processes, due to limited human capacity. In this work, we detail the real-world deployment of AI-assisted evaluation within the pipeline of two government initiatives: (i) corporate applications aimed at international business expansion, and (ii) citizen reimbursement claims for investments in energy-efficient home improvements. While these two cases involve distinct evaluation procedures, our findings confirm that AI effectively enhanced processing efficiency and reduced workload across both types of applications. Specifically, in the citizen reimbursement claims initiative, our solution increased reviewer productivity by 20.1%, while keeping a negligible false-positive rate based on our test set observations. These improvements resulted in an overall reduction of more than 2 months in the total evaluation time, illustrating the impact of AI-driven automation in large-scale evaluation workflows."
2510.09677,"Computational Thinking (CT) is a key skill set for students in higher education to thrive and adapt to an increasingly technology-driven future and workplace. While research on CT education has gained remarkable momentum in K12 over the past decade, it has remained under-explored in higher education, leaving higher education teachers with an insufficient overview, knowledge, and support regarding CT education. The proliferation and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by educational institutions have demonstrated promising potential to support instructional activities across many disciplines, including CT education. However, a comprehensive overview outlining the various aspects of integrating AI in CT education in higher education is lacking. To mitigate this gap, we conducted this systematic literature review study. The focus of our study is to identify initiatives applying AI in CT education within higher education and to explore various educational aspects of these initiatives, including the benefits and challenges of AI in CT education, instructional strategies employed, CT components covered, and AI techniques and models utilized. This study provides practical and scientific contributions to the CT education community, including an inventory of AI-based initiatives for CT education useful to educators, an overview of various aspects of integrating AI into CT education such as its benefits and challenges (e.g., AI potential to reshape CT education versus its potential to diminish students creativity) and insights into new and expanded perspectives on CT in light of AI (e.g., the decoding approach alongside the coding approach to CT)."
2510.09686,"Survey papers are foundational to the scholarly progress of research communities, offering structured overviews that guide both novices and experts across disciplines. However, the recent surge of AI-generated surveys, especially enabled by large language models (LLMs), has transformed this traditionally labor-intensive genre into a low-effort, high-volume output. While such automation lowers entry barriers, it also introduces a critical threat: the phenomenon we term the ""survey paper DDoS attack"" to the research community. This refers to the unchecked proliferation of superficially comprehensive but often redundant, low-quality, or even hallucinated survey manuscripts, which floods preprint platforms, overwhelms researchers, and erodes trust in the scientific record. In this position paper, we argue that we must stop uploading massive amounts of AI-generated survey papers (i.e., survey paper DDoS attack) to the research community, by instituting strong norms for AI-assisted review writing. We call for restoring expert oversight and transparency in AI usage and, moreover, developing new infrastructures such as Dynamic Live Surveys, community-maintained, version-controlled repositories that blend automated updates with human curation. Through quantitative trend analysis, quality audits, and cultural impact discussion, we show that safeguarding the integrity of surveys is no longer optional but imperative to the research community."
2510.09698,"Geographic data is vital in understanding, analyzing, and contextualizing energy usage at the regional level within electricity systems. While geospatial visualizations of electricity infrastructure and distributions of production and consumption are available from governmental and third-party sources, these sources are often disparate, and compatible geographic datasets remain scarce. In this paper, we present a comprehensive geographic dataset representing the electricity system in Norway. We collect data from multiple authoritative sources, process it into widely accepted formats, and generate interactive maps based on this data. Our dataset includes information for each municipality in Norway for the year 2024, encompassing electricity infrastructure, consumption, renewable and conventional production, main power grid topology, relevant natural resources, and population demographics. This work results in a formatted geographic dataset that integrates diverse informational resources, along with openly released interactive maps. We anticipate that our dataset will alleviate software incompatibilities in data retrieval, and facilitate joint analyses on regional electricity system for energy researchers, stakeholders, and developers."
2510.0984,"We argue that the principal application for blockchain technology will not be in the financial sector, but rather in maintaining decentralized human governance, from archives to transparent policies encoded in the blockchain in the form of smart contracts.. Such decentralized, blockchain-grounded governance comes not a moment too soon, as nation states are dissolving before our eyes. Will blockchain-based communities replace the nation state? What are the prospects and dangers of this development?"
2510.10176,"The proliferation of Large Language Models in higher education presents a fundamental challenge to traditional pedagogical frameworks. Drawing on Jacques Rancière's theory of intellectual emancipation, this paper examines how generative AI risks becoming a ""mechanical yes-man"" that reinforces passivity rather than fostering intellectual autonomy. Generative AI's statistical logic and lack of causal reasoning, combined with frictionless information access, threatens to hollow out cognitive processes essential for genuine learning. This creates a critical paradox: while generative AI systems are trained for complex reasoning, students increasingly use them to bypass the intellectual work that builds such capabilities. The paper critiques both techno-optimistic and restrictive approaches to generative AI in education, proposing instead an emancipatory pedagogy grounded in verification, mastery, and co-inquiry. This framework positions generative AI as material for intellectual work rather than a substitute for it, emphasising the cultivation of metacognitive awareness and critical interrogation of AI outputs. It requires educators to engage directly with these tools to guide students toward critical AI literacy, transforming pedagogical authority from explication to critical interloping that models intellectual courage and collaborative inquiry."
2510.10315,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relying on web crawling to stay up to date and accurately answer user queries. These crawlers are expected to honorthis http URLfiles, which govern automated access. In this study, for the first time, we investigate whether reputable news websites and misinformation sites differ in how they configure these files, particularly in relation to AI crawlers. Analyzing a curated dataset, we find a stark contrast: 60.0% of reputable sites disallow at least one AI crawler, compared to just 9.1% of misinformation sites in theirthis http URLfiles. Reputable sites forbid an average of 15.5 AI user agents, while misinformation sites prohibit fewer than one. We then measure active blocking behavior, where websites refuse to return content when HTTP requests include AI crawler user agents, and reveal that both categories of websites utilize it. Notably, the behavior of reputable news websites in this regard aligns more closely with their declaredthis http URLdirective than that of misinformation websites. Finally, our longitudinal analysis reveals that this gap has widened over time, with AI-blocking by reputable sites rising from 23% in September 2023 to nearly 60% by May 2025. Our findings highlight a growing asymmetry in content accessibility that may shape the training data available to LLMs, raising essential questions for web transparency, data ethics, and the future of AI training practices."
2510.10327,"Understanding and predicting pedestrian dynamics has become essential for shaping safer, more responsive, and human-centered urban environments. This study conducts a comprehensive scientometric analysis of research on data-driven pedestrian trajectory prediction and crowd simulation, mapping its intellectual evolution and interdisciplinary structure. Using bibliometric data from the Web of Science Core Collection, we employ SciExplorer and Bibliometrix to identify major trends, influential contributors, and emerging frontiers. Results reveal a strong convergence between artificial intelligence, urban informatics, and crowd behavior modeling--driven by graph neural networks, transformers, and generative models. Beyond technical advances, the field increasingly informs urban mobility design, public safety planning, and digital twin development for smart cities. However, challenges remain in ensuring interpretability, inclusivity, and cross-domain transferability. By connecting methodological trajectories with urban applications, this work highlights how data-driven approaches can enrich urban governance and pave the way for adaptive, socially responsible mobility intelligence in future cities."
2510.10413,"The technological revolution of the Internet has digitized the social, economic, political, and cultural activities of billions of humans. While researchers have been paying due attention to concerns of misinformation and bias, these obscure a much less researched and equally insidious problem - that of uncritically consuming incomplete information. The problem of incomplete information consumption stems from the very nature of explicitly ranked information on digital platforms, where our limited mental capacities leave us with little choice but to consume the tip of a pre-ranked information iceberg. This study makes two chief contributions. First, we leverage the context of internet search to propose an innovative metric that quantifies information completeness. For a given search query, this refers to the extent of the information spectrum that is observed during web browsing. We then validate this metric using 6.5 trillion search results extracted from daily search trends across 48 nations for one year. Second, we find causal evidence that awareness of information completeness while browsing the Internet reduces resistance to factual information, hence paving the way towards an open-minded and tolerant mindset."
2510.1052,"As the global reach of online higher education continues to grow, universities are increasingly accommodating students from diverse cultural backgrounds (Tereshko et al., 2024). This can present a number of challenges including linguistic barriers (Ullah et al., 2021), cultural differences in learning style (Omidvar & Tan, 2012), cultural sensitivity in course design (Nguyen, 2022) and perceived isolation when students feel their perspectives or experiences are not reflected or valued in the learning environment (Hansen-Brown et al., 2022). Ensuring active engagement and reasonable learning outcomes in such a environments requires distance educational systems that are not only adaptive but also culturally resonant (Dalle et al., 2024). Both embodied and virtual AI-Agents have great potential in this regard as they can facilitate personalized learning and adapt their interactions and content delivery to align with students' cultural context. In addition, Generative AI (GAI), such as, Large Language Models (LLMs) can amplify the potential for these culturally aware AI agents to address educational challenges due to their advanced capacity for understanding and generating contextually relevant content (Wang et al., 2024). This chapter reviews existing research and suggests the usage of culturally aware AI-Agents, powered by GAI, to foster engagement and improve learning outcomes in culturally diverse online higher education environments."
2510.10588,"The operationalization of ethics in the technical practices of artificial intelligence (AI) is facing significant challenges. To address the problem of ineffective implementation of AI ethics, we present our diagnosis, analysis, and interventional recommendations from a unique perspective of the real-world implementation of AI ethics through explainable AI (XAI) techniques. We first describe the phenomenon (i.e., the ""symptoms"") of ineffective implementation of AI ethics in explainable AI using four empirical cases. From the ""symptoms"", we diagnose the root cause (i.e., the ""disease"") being the dysfunction and imbalance of power structures in the sociotechnical system of AI. The power structures are dominated by unjust and unchecked power that does not represent the benefits and interests of the public and the most impacted communities, and cannot be countervailed by ethical power. Based on the understanding of power mechanisms, we propose three interventional recommendations to tackle the root cause, including: 1) Making power explicable and checked, 2) Reframing the narratives and assumptions of AI and AI ethics to check unjust power and reflect the values and benefits of the public, and 3) Uniting the efforts of ethical and scientific conduct of AI to encode ethical values as technical standards, norms, and methods, including conducting critical examinations and limitation analyses of AI technical practices. We hope that our diagnosis and interventional recommendations can be a useful input to the AI community and civil society's ongoing discussion and implementation of ethics in AI for ethical and responsible AI practice."
2510.10732,"Most frameworks for assessing the openness of AI systems use narrow criteria such as availability of data, model, code, documentation, and licensing terms. However, to evaluate whether the intended effects of openness - such as democratization and autonomy - are realized, we need a more holistic approach that considers the context of release: who will reuse the system, for what purposes, and under what conditions. To this end, we adapt five lessons from system safety that offer guidance on how openness can be evaluated at the system level."
2510.11064,"Gender stereotypes in introductory programming courses often go unnoticed, yet they can negatively influence young learners' interest and learning, particularly under-represented groups such as girls. Popular tutorials on block-based programming with Scratch may unintentionally reinforce biases through character choices, narrative framing, or activity types. Educators currently lack support in identifying and addressing such bias. With large language models~(LLMs) increasingly used to generate teaching materials, this problem is potentially exacerbated by LLMs trained on biased datasets. However, LLMs also offer an opportunity to address this issue. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs for automatically identifying gender-stereotypical elements in Scratch tutorials, thus offering feedback on how to improve teaching content. We develop a framework for assessing gender bias considering characters, content, instructions, and programming concepts. Analogous to how code analysis tools provide feedback on code in terms of code smells, we operationalise this framework using an automated tool chain that identifies *gender stereotype smells*. Evaluation on 73 popular Scratch tutorials from leading educational platforms demonstrates that stereotype smells are common in practice. LLMs are not effective at detecting them, but our gender bias evaluation framework can guide LLMs in generating tutorials with fewer stereotype smells."
2510.11556,"The evolving pedagogy paradigms are leading toward educational transformations. One fundamental aspect of effective learning is relevant, immediate, and constructive feedback to students. Providing constructive feedback to large cohorts in academia is an ongoing challenge. Therefore, academics are moving towards automated assessment to provide immediate feedback. However, current approaches are often limited in scope, offering simplistic responses that do not provide students with personalized feedback to guide them toward improvements. This paper addresses this limitation by investigating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing students assessments with predefined rubrics and marking criteria to generate personalized feedback for in-depth learning. We aim to leverage the power of existing LLMs for Marking Assessments, Tracking, and Evaluation (LLM-MATE) with personalized feedback to enhance students learning. To evaluate the performance of LLM-MATE, we consider the Software Architecture (SA) module as a case study. The LLM-MATE approach can help module leaders overcome assessment challenges with large cohorts. Also, it helps students improve their learning by obtaining personalized feedback in a timely manner. Additionally, the proposed approach will facilitate the establishment of ground truth for automating the generation of students assessment feedback using the ChatGPT API, thereby reducing the overhead associated with large cohort assessments."
2510.11734,"This research focuses on using large language models (LLMs) to simulate social experiments, exploring their ability to emulate human personality in virtual persona role-playing. The research develops an end-to-end evaluation framework, including individual-level analysis of stability and identifiability, as well as population-level analysis called progressive personality curves to examine the veracity and consistency of LLMs in simulating human personality. Methodologically, this research proposes important modifications to traditional psychometric approaches (CFA and construct validity) which are unable to capture improvement trends in LLMs at their current low-level simulation, potentially leading to remature rejection or methodological misalignment. The main contributions of this research are: proposing a systematic framework for LLM virtual personality evaluation; empirically demonstrating the critical role of persona detail in personality simulation quality; and identifying marginal utility effects of persona profiles, especially a Scaling Law in LLM personality simulation, offering operational evaluation metrics and a theoretical foundation for applying large language models in social science experiments."
2510.11742,"As Large Language Models increasingly mediate human communication and decision-making, understanding their value expression becomes critical for research across disciplines. This work presents the Ethics Engine, a modular Python pipeline that transforms psychometric assessment of LLMs from a technically complex endeavor into an accessible research tool. The pipeline demonstrates how thoughtful infrastructure design can expand participation in AI research, enabling investigators across cognitive science, political psychology, education, and other fields to study value expression in language models. Recent adoption by University of Edinburgh researchers studying authoritarianism validates its research utility, processing over 10,000 AI responses across multiple models and contexts. We argue that such tools fundamentally change the landscape of AI research by lowering technical barriers while maintaining scientific rigor. As LLMs increasingly serve as cognitive infrastructure, their embedded values shape millions of daily interactions. Without systematic measurement of these value expressions, we deploy systems whose moral influence remains uncharted. The Ethics Engine enables the rigorous assessment necessary for informed governance of these influential technologies."
2510.11749,"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents both challenges and opportunities across all areas of education. Facing the municipal elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Young AI Leaders in Dortmund asked themselves: Could GenAI be used to make political programs more accessible, in order to facilitate political education? To explore respective potentials and limitations, we therefore performed an experimental study that combines different GenAI approaches. Language models were used to automatically translate and analyze the contents of each program, deriving five potential visual appearance changes to the city of Dortmund. Based on each analysis, we then generated images with diffusion models and published all results as an interactive webpage. All GenAI models were locally deployed on a Dortmund-based computing cluster, allowing us to also investigate environmental impacts. This manuscript explores the project in full depth, discussing technical details and critically reflecting on the results. As part of the global Young AI Leaders Community, our work promotes the Sustainable Development Goal Quality Education (SDG 4) by transparently discussing the pros and cons of using GenAI for education and political agendas."
2510.11755,"In the rapidly evolving educational landscape, the integration of technology has shifted from an enhancement to a cornerstone of educational strategy worldwide. This transition is propelled by advancements in digital technology, especially the emergence of artificial intelligence as a crucial tool in learning environments. This research project critically evaluates the impact of three distinct educational settings: traditional educational methods without technological integration, those enhanced by non-AI technology, and those utilising AI-driven technologies. This comparison aims to assess how each environment influences educational outcomes, engagement, pedagogical methods, and equity in access to learning resources, and how each contributes uniquely to the learning experience. The ultimate goal of this research is to synthesise the strengths of each model to create a more holistic educational approach. By integrating the personal interaction and tested pedagogical techniques of traditional classrooms, the enhanced accessibility and collaborative tools offered by non-AI technology, and the personalised, adaptive learning strategies enabled by AI-driven technologies, education systems can develop richer, more effective learning environments. This hybrid approach aims to leverage the best elements of each setting, thereby enhancing educational outcomes, engagement, and inclusiveness, while also addressing the distinct challenges and limitations inherent in each model. The intention is to create an educational framework deeply attentive to the diverse needs of students, ensuring equitable access to high-quality education for all."
2510.11758,"This study compares the perception, adoption, and application of artificial intelligence (AI) among veterinary professionals in China and North America (NA), testing the hypothesis that adoption patterns are shaped by regional market and demographic factors. A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was conducted with 455 veterinary professionals in China between May and July 2025. The results were compared with published data from a 2024 survey of 3,968 veterinary professionals in the United States and Canada. The Chinese cohort, primarily composed of clinicians (81.5%), showed a high AI adoption rate (71.0%) despite low familiarity (55.4%). Their AI use was focused on clinical tasks, such as disease diagnosis (50.1%) and prescription calculation (44.8%). In contrast, the NA cohort reported high familiarity (83.8%) but a lower adoption rate (39.2%). Their priorities were administrative, including imaging analysis (39.0%) and record-keeping (39.0%). Concerns about AI reliability and accuracy were the top barrier in both groups. Our findings reveal an ""adoption paradox"" where the Chinese market demonstrates a practitioner-driven, bottom-up adoption model focused on augmenting clinical efficacy, while the NA market shows a more cautious, structured, top-down integration aimed at improving administrative efficiency. This suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to AI development and integration is insufficient, and tailored, region-specific strategies are necessary to responsibly incorporate AI into global veterinary practice."
2510.12689,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising accuracy in predicting survey responses and policy preferences, which has increased interest in their potential to represent human interests in various domains. Most existing research has focused on behavioral cloning, effectively evaluating how well models reproduce individuals' expressed preferences. Drawing on theories of political representation, we highlight an underexplored design trade-off: whether AI systems should act as delegates, mirroring expressed preferences, or as trustees, exercising judgment about what best serves an individual's interests. This trade-off is closely related to issues of LLM sycophancy, where models can encourage behavior or validate beliefs that may be aligned with a user's short-term preferences, but is detrimental to their long-term interests. Through a series of experiments simulating votes on various policy issues in the U.S. context, we apply a temporal utility framework that weighs short and long-term interests (simulating a trustee role) and compare voting outcomes to behavior-cloning models (simulating a delegate). We find that trustee-style predictions weighted toward long-term interests produce policy decisions that align more closely with expert consensus on well-understood issues, but also show greater bias toward models' default stances on topics lacking clear agreement. These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off in designing AI systems to represent human interests. Delegate models better preserve user autonomy but may diverge from well-supported policy positions, while trustee models can promote welfare on well-understood issues yet risk paternalism and bias on subjective topics."
2510.12809,"The rapid progression of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research demands conceptual tools capable of distinguishing between systems developed for open, commercial integration and those destined for sovereign, securitized deployments. Without such distinctions, risk assessments and regulatory debates collapse AGI into legacy dual-use frameworks that are ill-suited for these resources, capturing the possibility of civilian and military application but overlooking the distinct societal lineages yielded by corporate and state-grade architectures. This paper proposes a taxonomy distinguishing low-AGI and high-AGI, clarifying how commercial-economic and security-sovereign architectures can be distinguished not only by function, but by the social and political ecosystems that produce them. The taxonomy builds on international relations concepts of ""high/low politics,"" viewed through the lens of construal-level theory, which allows it to even capture how cooperation and conflict may coexist in the context of AGI's emerging geopolitical stakes. By embedding AGI within power structures and securitization theory, this contribution extends dual-use discourse through an ontological taxonomy that enables more granular risk assessment and governance design--equipping policymakers and researchers to anticipate security dilemmas, institutional demands, and technical-political spillovers in the international system."
2510.12814,"The rise of ``cyber slavery,"" a technologically facilitated variant of forced criminality, signifies a concerning convergence of human trafficking and digital exploitation. In Southeast Asia, trafficked individuals are increasingly coerced into engaging in cybercrimes, including online fraud and financial phishing, frequently facilitated by international organized criminal networks. This study adopts a hybrid qualitative-computational methodology, combining a systematic narrative review with case-level metadata extracted from real-world cyber trafficking incidents through collaboration with Indian law enforcement agencies. We introduce a five-tier victimization framework that outlines the sequential state transitions of cyber-slavery victims, ranging from initial financial deception to physical exploitation, culminating in systemic prosecution through trace-based misattribution. Furthermore, our findings indicate that a significant socio-technical risk of cyber slavery is its capacity to evolve from forced to voluntary digital criminality, as victims, initially compelled to engage in cyber-enabled crimes, may choose to persist in their involvement due to financial incentives and the perceived security provided by digital anonymity. This legal-technological gap hampers victim identification processes, imposing excessive pressure on law enforcement systems dependent on binary legal categorizations, which ultimately hinders the implementation of victim-centered investigative methods and increases the likelihood of prosecutorial misclassification, thus reinforcing the structural obstacles to addressing cyber slavery."
2510.1282,"As demand for AI literacy and data science education grows, there is a critical need for infrastructure that bridges the gap between research data, computational resources, and educational experiences. To address this gap, we developed a first-of-its-kind Education Hub within the National Data Platform. This hub enables seamless connections between collaborative research workspaces, classroom environments, and data challenge settings. Early use cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the platform in supporting complex and resource-intensive educational activities. Ongoing efforts aim to enhance the user experience and expand adoption by educators and learners alike."
2510.12822,"The growing philosophical literature on algorithmic fairness has examined statistical criteria such as equalized odds and calibration, causal and counterfactual approaches, and the role of structural and compounding injustices. Yet an important dimension has been overlooked: whether the evidential value of an algorithmic output itself depends on structural injustice. We contrast a predictive policing algorithm, which relies on historical crime data, with a camera-based system that records ongoing offenses, where both are designed to guide police deployment. In evaluating the moral acceptability of acting on a piece of evidence, we must ask not only whether the evidence is probative in the actual world, but also whether it would remain probative in nearby worlds without the relevant injustices. The predictive policing algorithm fails this test, but the camera-based system passes it. When evidence fails the test, it is morally problematic to use it punitively, more so than evidence that passes the test."
2510.1283,"This paper presents a comprehensive governance framework for AI systems in the legal sector, designed to ensure verifiable compliance with the EU AI Act. The framework integrates a normative mapping of the regulation to technical controls, a forensic architecture for RAG/LLM systems, and an evaluation system with metrics weighted by legal risk. As a primary contribution, we present rag-forense, an open-source implementation of the framework, accompanied by an experimental protocol to demonstrate compliance. -- Este artículo presenta un marco integral de gobernanza para sistemas de IA en el sector legal, diseñado para garantizar el cumplimiento verificable del Reglamento de IA de la UE (AI Act).

Como principal contribución, se presenta rag-forense, una implementación de código abierto del marco, acompañada de un protocolo experimental para demostrar la conformidad."
2510.12836,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have tremendous potential to play a key role in supporting mathematical reasoning, with growing use in education and AI research. However, most existing benchmarks are limited to English, creating a significant gap for low-resource languages. For example, Bangla is spoken by nearly 250 million people who would collectively benefit from LLMs capable of native fluency. To address this, we present BanglaMATH, a dataset of 1.7k Bangla math word problems across topics such as Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, and Logical Reasoning, sourced from Bangla elementary school workbooks and annotated with details like grade level and number of reasoning steps. We have designed BanglaMATH to evaluate the mathematical capabilities of both commercial and open-source LLMs in Bangla, and we find that Gemini 2.5 Flash and DeepSeek V3 are the only models to achieve strong performance, with $\ge$ 80\% accuracy across three elementary school grades. Furthermore, we assess the robustness and language bias of these top-performing LLMs by augmenting the original problems with distracting information, and translating the problems into English. We show that both LLMs fail to maintain robustness and exhibit significant performance bias in Bangla. Our study underlines current limitations of LLMs in handling arithmetic and mathematical reasoning in low-resource languages, and highlights the need for further research on multilingual and equitable mathematical understanding.

2510.12841,"The emergence of smart cities and sustainable development has become a globally accepted form of urbanization. The epitome of smart city development has become possible due to the latest innovative integration of information and communication technology. Citizens of smart cities can enjoy the benefits of a smart living environment, ubiquitous connectivity, seamless access to services, intelligent decision making through smart governance, and optimized resource management. The widespread acceptance of smart cities has raised data security issues, authentication, unauthorized access, device-level vulnerability, and sustainability. This paper focuses on the wholistic overview and conceptual development of smart city. Initially, the work discusses the smart city idea and fundamentals explored in various pieces of literature. Further various smart city applications, including notable implementations, are put forth to understand the quality of living standards. Finally, the paper depicts a solid understanding of different security and privacy issues, including some crucial future research directions."
2510.12844,"A morally acceptable course of AI development should avoid two dangers: creating unaligned AI systems that pose a threat to humanity and mistreating AI systems that merit moral consideration in their own right. This paper argues these two dangers interact and that if we create AI systems that merit moral consideration, simultaneously avoiding both of these dangers would be extremely challenging. While our argument is straightforward and supported by a wide range of pretheoretical moral judgments, it has far-reaching moral implications for AI development. Although the most obvious way to avoid the tension between alignment and ethical treatment would be to avoid creating AI systems that merit moral consideration, this option may be unrealistic and is perhaps fleeting. So, we conclude by offering some suggestions for other ways of mitigating mistreatment risks associated with alignment."
2510.1285,"Developing AI systems capable of nuanced ethical reasoning is critical as they increasingly influence human decisions, yet existing models often rely on superficial correlations rather than principled moral understanding. This paper introduces Ethic-BERT, a BERT-based model for ethical content classification across four domains: Commonsense, Justice, Virtue, and Deontology. Leveraging the ETHICS dataset, our approach integrates robust preprocessing to address vocabulary sparsity and contextual ambiguities, alongside advanced fine-tuning strategies like full model unfreezing, gradient accumulation, and adaptive learning rate scheduling. To evaluate robustness, we employ an adversarially filtered ""Hard Test"" split, isolating complex ethical dilemmas. Experimental results demonstrate Ethic-BERT's superiority over baseline models, achieving 82.32% average accuracy on the standard test, with notable improvements in Justice and Virtue. In addition, the proposed Ethic-BERT attains 15.28% average accuracy improvement in the HardTest. These findings contribute to performance improvement and reliable decision-making using bias-aware preprocessing and proposed enhanced AI model."
2510.12857,"Large language models (LLMs) are now widely deployed in user-facing applications, reaching hundreds of millions worldwide. As they become integrated into everyday tasks, growing reliance on their outputs raises significant concerns. In particular, users may unknowingly be exposed to model-inherent biases that systematically disadvantage or stereotype certain groups. However, existing bias benchmarks continue to rely on templated prompts or restrictive multiple-choice questions that are suggestive, simplistic, and fail to capture the complexity of real-world user interactions. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a counterfactual bias evaluation framework that automatically generates realistic, open-ended questions over sensitive attributes such as sex, race, or religion. By iteratively mutating and selecting bias-inducing questions, our approach systematically explores areas where models are most susceptible to biased behavior. Beyond detecting harmful biases, we also capture distinct response dimensions that are increasingly relevant in user interactions, such as asymmetric refusals and explicit acknowledgment of bias. Leveraging our framework, we construct CAB, a human-verified benchmark spanning diverse topics, designed to enable cross-model comparisons. Using CAB, we analyze a range of LLMs across multiple bias dimensions, revealing nuanced insights into how different models manifest bias. For instance, while GPT-5 outperforms other models, it nonetheless exhibits persistent biases in specific scenarios. These findings underscore the need for continual improvements to ensure fair model behavior."
2510.12859,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as both a continuation of historical technological revolutions and a potential rupture with them. This paper argues that AI must be viewed simultaneously through three lenses: \textit{risk}, where it resembles nuclear technology in its irreversible and global externalities; \textit{transformation}, where it parallels the Industrial Revolution as a general-purpose technology driving productivity and reorganization of labor; and \textit{continuity}, where it extends the fifty-year arc of computing revolutions from personal computing to the internet to mobile. Drawing on historical analogies, we emphasize that no past transition constituted a strict singularity: disruptive shifts eventually became governable through new norms and institutions.We examine recurring patterns across revolutions -- democratization at the usage layer, concentration at the production layer, falling costs, and deepening personalization -- and show how these dynamics are intensifying in the AI era. Sectoral analysis illustrates how accounting, law, education, translation, advertising, and software engineering are being reshaped as routine cognition is commoditized and human value shifts to judgment, trust, and ethical responsibility. At the frontier, the challenge of designing moral AI agents highlights the need for robust guardrails, mechanisms for moral generalization, and governance of emergent multi-agent dynamics.We conclude that AI is neither a singular break nor merely incremental progress. It is both evolutionary and revolutionary: predictable in its median effects yet carrying singularity-class tail risks. Good outcomes are not automatic; they require coupling pro-innovation strategies with safety governance, ensuring equitable access, and embedding AI within a human order of responsibility."
2510.12915,"Critical thinking represents a fundamental competency in today's education landscape. Developing critical thinking skills through timely assessment and feedback is crucial; however, there has not been extensive work in the learning analytics community on defining, measuring, and supporting critical thinking. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of measuring core ""subskills"" that underlie critical thinking. We ground our work in an authentic task where students operationalize critical thinking: student-written argumentative essays. We developed a coding rubric based on an established skills progression and completed human coding for a corpus of student essays. We then evaluated three distinct approaches to automated scoring: zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and supervised fine-tuning, implemented across three large language models (GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and ModernBERT). GPT-5 with few-shot prompting achieved the strongest results and demonstrated particular strength on subskills with separable, frequent categories, while lower performance was observed for subskills that required detection of subtle distinctions or rare categories. Our results underscore critical trade-offs in automated critical thinking assessment: proprietary models offer superior reliability at higher cost, while open-source alternatives provide practical accuracy with reduced sensitivity to minority categories. Our work represents an initial step toward scalable assessment of higher-order reasoning skills across authentic educational contexts."
2510.13139,"A key challenge in transportation planning is that the collective preferences of heterogeneous travelers often diverge from the policies produced by model-driven decision tools. This misalignment frequently results in implementation delays or failures. Here, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs), noted for their capabilities in reasoning and simulating human decision-making, can help inform and address this alignment problem. We develop a multi-agent simulation in which LLMs, acting as agents representing residents from different communities in a city, participate in a referendum on a set of transit policy proposals. Using chain-of-thought reasoning, LLM agents provide ranked-choice or approval-based preferences, which are aggregated using instant-runoff voting (IRV) to model democratic consensus. We implement this simulation framework with both GPT-4o and Claude-3.5, and apply it for Chicago and Houston. Our findings suggest that LLM agents are capable of approximating plausible collective preferences and responding to local context, while also displaying model-specific behavioral biases and modest divergences from optimization-based benchmarks. These capabilities underscore both the promise and limitations of LLMs as tools for solving the alignment problem in transportation decision-making."
2510.13162,"We report on two months of ethnographic fieldwork in a women's centre in Pattaya, and interviews with 76 participants. Our findings, as they relate to digital security, show how (i) women in Pattaya, often working in the sex and massage industries, perceived relationships with farang men as their best, and sometimes only, option to achieve security; (ii) the strategies used by the women to appeal to a farang involved presenting themselves online, mirroring how they were being advertised by bar owners to attract customers; (iii) appealing to what they considered `Western ideals', the women sought out `Western technologies' and appropriated them for their benefit; (iv) the women navigated a series of online security risks, such as scams and abuse, which shaped their search for a farang; (v) the women developed collective security through knowledge-sharing to protect themselves and each other in their search for a farang. We situate our work in emerging digital security scholarship within marginalised contexts."
2510.13465,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has a huge impact on our personal lives and also on our democratic society as a whole. While AI offers vast opportunities for the benefit of people, its potential to embed and perpetuate bias and discrimination remains one of the most pressing challenges deriving from its increasing use. This new study, which was prepared by Prof. Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius for the Anti-discrimination Department of the Council of Europe, elaborates on the risks of discrimination caused by algorithmic decision-making and other types of artificial intelligence (AI)."
2510.13466,"In modern markets, many companies offer so-called 'free' services and monetize consumer data they collect through those services. This paper argues that consumer law and data protection law can usefully complement each other. Data protection law can also inform the interpretation of consumer law. Using consumer rights, consumers should be able to challenge excessive collection of their personal data. Consumer organizations have used consumer law to tackle data protection infringements. The interplay of data protection law and consumer protection law provides exciting opportunities for a more integrated vision on 'data consumer law'."
2510.13468,"In this chapter we discuss the relation between privacy and freedom of expression in Europe. In principle, the two rights have equal weight in Europe - which right prevails depends on the circumstances of a case. We use the Google Spain judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union, sometimes called the 'right to be forgotten' judgment, to illustrate the difficulties when balancing the two rights. The court decided in Google Spain that people have, under certain conditions, the right to have search results for their name delisted. We discuss how Google and Data Protection Authorities deal with such delisting requests in practice. Delisting requests illustrate that balancing privacy and freedom of expression interests will always remain difficult."
2510.13591,"The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) establishes the world's first comprehensive regulatory framework for AI systems through a sophisticated ecosystem of interconnected subjects defined in Article 3. This paper provides a structured examination of the six main categories of actors - providers, deployers, authorized representatives, importers, distributors, and product manufacturers - collectively referred to as ""operators"" within the regulation. Through examination of these Article 3 definitions and their elaboration across the regulation's 113 articles, 180 recitals, and 13 annexes, we map the complete governance structure and analyze how the AI Act regulates these subjects. Our analysis reveals critical transformation mechanisms whereby subjects can assume different roles under specific conditions, particularly through Article 25 provisions ensuring accountability follows control. We identify how obligations cascade through the supply chain via mandatory information flows and cooperation requirements, creating a distributed yet coordinated governance system. The findings demonstrate how the regulation balances innovation with the protection of fundamental rights through risk-based obligations that scale with the capabilities and deployment contexts of AI systems, providing essential guidance for stakeholders implementing the AI Act's requirements."
2510.13621,"Cutting-edge research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires considerable resources, including Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), data, and human resources. In this paper, we evaluate of the relationship between these resources and the scientific advancement of foundation models (FM). We reviewed 6517 FM papers published between 2022 to 2024, and surveyed 229 first-authors to the impact of computing resources on scientific output. We find that increased computing is correlated with national funding allocations and citations, but our findings don't observe the strong correlations with research environment (academic or industrial), domain, or study methodology. We advise that individuals and institutions focus on creating shared and affordable computing opportunities to lower the entry barrier for under-resourced researchers. These steps can help expand participation in FM research, foster diversity of ideas and contributors, and sustain innovation and progress in AI. The data will be available at:this https URL"
2510.13653,"Since the publication of the first International AI Safety Report, AI capabilities have continued to improve across key domains. New training techniques that teach AI systems to reason step-by-step and inference-time enhancements have primarily driven these advances, rather than simply training larger models. As a result, general-purpose AI systems can solve more complex problems in a range of domains, from scientific research to software development. Their performance on benchmarks that measure performance in coding, mathematics, and answering expert-level science questions has continued to improve, though reliability challenges persist, with systems excelling on some tasks while failing completely on others. These capability improvements also have implications for multiple risks, including risks from biological weapons and cyber attacks. Finally, they pose new challenges for monitoring and controllability. This update examines how AI capabilities have improved since the first Report, then focuses on key risk areas where substantial new evidence warrants updated assessments."

2510.14457,"Timely and high-quality feedback is essential for effective learning in programming courses; yet, providing such support at scale remains a challenge. While AI-based systems offer scalable and immediate help, their responses can occasionally be inaccurate or insufficient. Human instructors, in contrast, may bring more valuable expertise but are limited in time and availability. To address these limitations, we present a hybrid help framework that integrates AI-generated hints with an escalation mechanism, allowing students to request feedback from instructors when AI support falls short. This design leverages the strengths of AI for scale and responsiveness while reserving instructor effort for moments of greatest need. We deployed this tool in a data science programming course with 82 students. We observe that out of the total 673 AI-generated hints, students rated 146 (22%) as unhelpful. Among those, only 16 (11%) of the cases were escalated to the instructors. A qualitative investigation of instructor responses showed that those feedback instances were incorrect or insufficient roughly half of the time. This finding suggests that when AI support fails, even instructors with expertise may need to pay greater attention to avoid making mistakes. We will publicly release the tool for broader adoption and enable further studies in other classrooms. Our work contributes a practical approach to scaling high-quality support and informs future efforts to effectively integrate AI and humans in education."
2510.14818,"Pink slime journalism is a practice where news outlets publish low-quality or inflammatory partisan articles, claiming to be local news networks. This paper examines the spread of pink slime sites on Facebook using public posts from Pages and Groups. We evaluate the trends of sharing pink slime sites on Facebook and patterns regarding the advertisements purchased by the parent organizations of the pink slime news networks. Our analysis discovers that while the number of pink slime posts on Facebook pages have decreased over the years, advertising dollars have increased. The increase in advertising dollars influences an increase in Facebook group posts. Further, the advertising expenditure increases during election years, but contentious topics are still discussed during non-election years. By illustrating the patterns and themes from US election years of 2020, 2022, and 2024, this research offers insights into potentially dangerous journalism tactics, and provides predictions for future US Presidential Elections."
2510.14892,"The Indian judicial system faces a critical challenge with approximately 52 million pending cases, causing significant delays that impact socio-economic stability. This study proposes a cloud-based software framework to classify and prioritize court cases using algorithmic methods based on parameters such as severity of crime committed, responsibility of parties involved, case filing dates, previous hearing's data, priority level (e.g., Urgent, Medium, Ordinary) provided as input, and relevant Indian Penal Code (IPC), Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and other legal sections (e.g., Hindu Marriage Act, Indian Contract Act). Cases are initially entered by advocates on record or court registrars, followed by automated hearing date allocation that balances fresh and old cases while accounting for court holidays and leaves. The system streamlines appellate processes by fetching data from historical case databases. Our methodology integrates algorithmic prioritization, a robust notification system, and judicial interaction, with features that allow judges to view daily case counts and their details. Simulations demonstrate that the system can process cases efficiently, with reliable notification delivery and positive user satisfaction among judges and registrars. Future iterations will incorporate advanced machine learning for dynamic prioritization, addressing critical gaps in existing court case management systems to enhance efficiency and reduce backlogs."
2510.15142,"This study investigates whether demographic factors shape adoption and attitudes among employees toward artificial intelligence (AI) technologies at work. Building on an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), which reintroduces affective dimensions such as attitude, self-efficacy, and anxiety, we surveyed 2,257 professionals across global regions and organizational levels within a multinational consulting firm. Non-parametric tests examined whether three demographic factors (i.e., years of experience, hierarchical level in the organization, and geographic region) were associated with AI adoption, usage intensity, and eight UTAUT constructs. Organizational level significantly predicted AI adoption, with senior employees showing higher usage rates, while experience and region were unrelated to adoption. Among AI users (n = 1,256), frequency and duration of use showed minimal demographic variation. However, omnibus tests revealed small but consistent group differences across several UTAUT constructs, particularly anxiety, performance expectancy, and behavioral intention, suggesting that emotional and cognitive responses to AI vary modestly across contexts. These findings highlight that demographic factors explain limited variance in AI acceptance but remain relevant for understanding contextual nuances in technology-related attitudes. The results underscore the need to integrate affective and organizational factors into models of technology acceptance to support equitable, confident, and sustainable engagement with AI in modern workplaces."
2510.15256,"Why have left-wing movements historically integrated participatory art forms (such as murals and protest songs) into their praxis, while right-wing movements have prioritized strategic communication and, more recently, the digital culture of memes? This article introduces the concept of aesthetic asymmetry to explain this divergence in political action. We argue that the asymmetry is not coincidental but the result of four interconnected structural factors: the organizational ecosystem, the moral and emotional framework, the material supports, and the historical tradition of each political spectrum. While the left tends to use art in a constitutive manner to forge community, solidarity, and hope, the contemporary right tends to use it instrumentally to mobilize polarizing affects such as humor and resentment. Drawing on comparative literature from the Theatre of the Oppressed to analyses of alt-right meme wars, we nuance this distinction and show how the aesthetic logic of each pole aligns with its strategic objectives. The article culminates in a prescriptive model for artistic action, synthesizing keys to effective mobilization into emotional, narrative, and formatting strategies. Understanding this asymmetry is crucial for analyzing political communication and for designing cultural interventions capable of generating profound social change."
2510.15297,"We introduce VERA-MH (Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health), an automated evaluation of the safety of AI chatbots used in mental health contexts, with an initial focus on suicide risk.Practicing clinicians and academic experts developed a rubric informed by best practices for suicide risk management for the evaluation. To fully automate the process, we used two ancillary AI agents. A user-agent model simulates users engaging in a mental health-based conversation with the chatbot under evaluation. The user-agent role-plays specific personas with pre-defined risk levels and other features. Simulated conversations are then passed to a judge-agent who scores them based on the rubric. The final evaluation of the chatbot being tested is obtained by aggregating the scoring of each conversation.VERA-MH is actively under development and undergoing rigorous validation by mental health clinicians to ensure user-agents realistically act as patients and that the judge-agent accurately scores the AI chatbot. To date we have conducted preliminary evaluation of GPT-5, Claude Opus and Claude Sonnet using initial versions of the VERA-MH rubric and used the findings for further design development. Next steps will include more robust clinical validation and iteration, as well as refining actionable scoring. We are seeking feedback from the community on both the technical and clinical aspects of our evaluation."

While applicable to various disciplines, this session focuses on engineering curricula, identifying discipline-specific challenges and potential adaptations. Participants will engage in Step 1 of the game, analyzing trigger events and their impacts on curriculum structures. At the end of the workshop, attendees will be able to identify key triggers that may affect curricula, assess their cascading effects, and reflect on the applicability of SUCRE within their own institutions."
2510.15509,"AI has the potential to significantly improve how NGOs utilize their limited resources for societal benefits, but evidence about how NGOs adopt AI remains scattered. In this study, we systematically investigate the types of AI adoption use cases in NGOs and identify common challenges and solutions, contextualized by organizational size and geographic context. We review the existing primary literature, including studies that investigate AI adoption in NGOs related to social impact between 2020 and 2025 in English. Following the PRISMA protocol, two independent reviewers conduct study selection, with regular cross-checking to ensure methodological rigour, resulting in a final literature body of 65 studies. Leveraging a thematic and narrative approach, we identify six AI use case categories in NGOs - Engagement, Creativity, Decision-Making, Prediction, Management, and Optimization - and extract common challenges and solutions within the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. By integrating our findings, this review provides a novel understanding of AI adoption in NGOs, linking specific use cases and challenges to organizational and environmental factors. Our results demonstrate that while AI is promising, adoption among NGOs remains uneven and biased towards larger organizations. Nevertheless, following a roadmap grounded in literature can help NGOs overcome initial barriers to AI adoption, ultimately improving effectiveness, engagement, and social impact."
2510.15805,"As disinformation-driven cognitive attacks become increasingly sophisticated, the ability to quantify their impact is essential for advancing cybersecurity defense strategies. This paper presents a novel framework for measuring the engagement effectiveness of cognitive attacks by introducing a weighted interaction metric that accounts for both the type and volume of user engagement relative to the number of attacker-generated transmissions. Applying this model to real-world disinformation campaigns across social media platforms, we demonstrate how the metric captures not just reach but the behavioral depth of user engagement. Our findings provide new insights into the behavioral dynamics of cognitive warfare and offer actionable tools for researchers and practitioners seeking to assess and counter the spread of malicious influence online."
2510.15936,"The study explores the role of large language models (LLMs) in the context of the architectural design studio, understood as the pedagogical core of architectural education. Traditionally, the studio has functioned as an experiential learning space where students tackle design problems through reflective practice, peer critique, and faculty guidance. However, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in this environment has been largely focused on form generation, automation, and representation-al efficiency, neglecting its potential as a pedagogical tool to strengthen student autonomy, collaboration, and self-reflection. The objectives of this research were: (1) to identify pedagogical challenges in self-directed, peer-to-peer, and teacher-guided learning processes in architecture studies; (2) to propose AI interventions, particularly through LLM, that contribute to overcoming these challenges; and (3) to align these interventions with measurable learning outcomes using Bloom's taxonomy. The findings show that the main challenges include managing student autonomy, tensions in peer feedback, and the difficulty of balancing the transmission of technical knowledge with the stimulation of creativity in teaching. In response to this, LLMs are emerging as complementary agents capable of generating personalized feedback, organizing collaborative interactions, and offering adaptive cognitive scaffolding. Furthermore, their implementation can be linked to the cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy: facilitating the recall and understanding of architectural concepts, supporting application and analysis through interactive case studies, and encouraging synthesis and evaluation through hypothetical design scenarios."
2510.15943,"We offer a pragmatic model to operationalize responsible, secure, and sustainable healthcare AI, aligning world-class technical excellence with organizational readiness. The framework includes five key pillars - Leadership & Strategy, MLOps & Technical Infrastructure, Governance & Ethics, Education & Workforce Development, and Change Management & Adoption - and is intended to operationalize 'compliance-by-design' while delivering measurable impact. We demonstrate its utility through two deployments. (A) An inpatient length of stay (LOS) prediction service had R^2=0.41-0.58 with validation cohorts in an observational pilot (n = 3,184 encounters, 4 units, June-August 2025). Adoption was 78 percent by week 6, and target units saw 5-10 percent relative declines in mean LOS for complex cases vs. pre-pilot baselines. (B) An AI-augmented radiology second-reader for lung nodules (PACS-integrated with thresholding and explanation overlays) achieved high sensitivity (95 percent) and provided a +8.0 percentage-point lift in detection of sub-centimeter actionable findings, without slowing workflow (median report TAT 23 min, p = 0.64). Both services executed in monitored, auditable pipelines with well-defined rollback, bias checks, and no evidence of security incidents. These findings indicate that by combining strong MLOps and AI security with governance, education, and human-centric change, we can accelerate adoption of AI while improving security and outcomes. We end with limitations, generalization considerations, and a roadmap for scaling across varied clinical and operational use cases."
2510.15951,"Although language model-based chat systems are increasingly used in daily life, most Americans remain non-adopters of chat-based LLMs -- as of June 2025, 66% had never used ChatGPT. At the same time, LLM development and evaluation rely mainly on data from adopters (e.g., logs, preference data), focusing on the needs and tasks for a limited demographic group of adopters in terms of geographic location, education, and gender. In this position paper, we argue that incorporating non-adopter perspectives is essential for developing broadly useful and capable LLMs. We contend that relying on methods that focus primarily on adopters will risk missing a range of tasks and needs prioritized by non-adopters, entrenching inequalities in who benefits from LLMs, and creating oversights in model development and evaluation. To illustrate this claim, we conduct case studies with non-adopters and show: how non-adopter needs diverge from those of current users, how non-adopter needs point us towards novel reasoning tasks, and how to systematically integrate non-adopter needs via human-centered methods."
2510.16019,"Students at all levels of education are increasingly relying on generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to complete assignments and achieve higher exam scores. However, it remains unclear how this reliance affects their motivation, their genuine understanding of the material, and the extent to which it substitutes for the process of knowledge acquisition. To investigate the impact of generative AI on learning outcomes, an experiment was conducted at Corvinus University of Budapest. In an operations research class, students were randomly assigned into two groups: one was permitted to use AI tools during classes and examinations, while the other was not. To ensure fairness, a compensation mechanism was introduced: students in the lower-performing group received point adjustments until the average performance of the two groups was equalized. Despite the organizers' best efforts to explain the design and to create equal opportunities for all participants, many students perceived the experiment as a major disruption. Although the experiment was approved by every relevant university authority -- including the Ethics Board, the Head of Department, the Program Director, and the Student Council -- students escalated their concerns to the media and eventually to the State Secretary for Higher Education of Hungary. As a result, the experiment had to be substantially revised before completion: on the final exam the test group was merged with the control group. Still, the data allowed us to draw decisive conclusions regarding the students' learning habits. Uncontrolled use of AI tools leads to disengaged students and low understanding of material. The extreme reactions of the students proved even more revealing than the data collected: generative AI tools have already become indispensable for students, raising fundamental questions about the validity of their learning process."
2510.16032,"In response to the escalating threat of misinformation, social media platforms have introduced a wide range of interventions aimed at reducing the spread and influence of false information. However, there is a lack of a coherent macrolevel perspective that explains how these interventions operate independently and collectively. To address this gap, I offer a dual typology through a spectrum of interventions aligned with deterrence theory and drawing parallels from international relations, military, cybersecurity, and public health. I argue that five major types of platform interventions, including removal, reduction, informing, composite, and multimodal, can be mapped to five corresponding deterrence mechanisms, including hard, situational, soft, integrated, and mixed deterrence based on purpose and perceptibility. These mappings illuminate how platforms apply varying degrees of deterrence mechanisms to influence user behavior."
2510.16042,"This paper investigates the concept of Labour as an expression of `timenergy' - a fusion of time and energy - and its entanglement within the system of Capital. We define Labour as the commodified, quantifiable expansion of timenergy, in contrast to Capital, which is capable of accumulation and abstraction. We explore Labour's historical evolution, its coercive and alienating nature, and its transformation through automation and artificial intelligence. Using a game-theoretic, agent-based simulation, we model interactions between Capital and Labour in production processes governed by Cobb-Douglas functions. Our results show that despite theoretical symmetry, learning agents disproportionately gravitate toward capital-intensive processes, revealing Capital's superior organizational influence due to its accumulative capacity. We argue that Capital functions as an artificially alive system animated by the living Labour it consumes, and question whether life can sustain itself without the infrastructures of Capital in a future of increasing automation. This study offers both a critique of and a framework for understanding Labour's subjugation within the Capital system."
2510.16048,"Any argument that open-source generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is inherently ethical or legal solely because it is open source is flawed. Yet, this is the explicit or implicit stance of several open-source GenAI entities. This paper critically examines prevalent justifications for ""open-source exceptionalism,"" demonstrating how contemporary open-source GenAI often inadvertently facilitates unlawful conduct and environmental degradation without genuinely disrupting established oligopolies. Furthermore, the paper exposes the unsubstantiated and strategic deployment of ""democratization"" and ""innovation"" rhetoric to advocate for regulatory exemptions not afforded to proprietary systems.The conclusion is that open-source developers must be held to the same legal and ethical standards as all other actors in the technological ecosystem. However, the paper proposes a narrowly tailored safe harbor designed to protect legitimate, non-commercial scientific research, contingent upon adherence to specific criteria. Ultimately, this paper advocates for a framework of responsible AI development, wherein openness is pursued within established ethical and legal boundaries, with due consideration for its broader societal implications."
2510.16049,"This paper argues that website owners have the right to exclude others from their websites. Accordingly, when generative AI (GenAI) scraping bots intentionally circumvent reasonable technological barriers, their conduct could be actionable as trespass to chattels. If the scraping leads to a decrease in the website's value, then trespass to chattels should apply. The prevailing judicial focus on website content and the dismissal of trespass claims absent proof of server impairment or user disruption misconstrues the nature of the website itself as a form of digital property, focusing too narrowly on what constitutes harm under a claim of trespass. By shifting analysis from content to the website itself as an integrated digital asset and illustrating the harm to the value of the chattel, this paper demonstrates that the right to exclude applies online with the same force as it does to tangible property.Courts and litigants have struggled to police large-scale scraping because copyright preemption narrows available claims, leaving copyright and its fair use defense as the primary battleground. In contrast, recognizing websites as personal property revives trespass to chattels as a meaningful cause of action, providing website owners with an enforceable exclusionary right. Such protection would disincentivize exploitative scraping, preserve incentives for content creation, aid in protecting privacy and personal data, and safeguard values of autonomy and expression. Ultimately, this paper contends that reaffirming website owners' right to exclude is essential to maintaining a fair and sustainable online environment."
2510.1605,"Student retention is one of the rising problems seen in educational institutions. With the rising cost of education and issues in the education sector, such as curriculum relevance, student engagement, and rapidly changing technological advancements, ensuring the relevance of academic programs in a fast-evolving job market has created a significant concern for educational institutions. With the intent to adapt to such challenges, educational institutions are dealing with alternative solutions for education, in which micro-credentials are at the very center of this, which are short-term academic programs or standalone courses. However, one of the challenges of micro-credentials is a lack of credit transfer among institutions. With the lack of standardization of assessments among educational institutions, it is difficult to transfer micro-credentials to larger qualifications. Regarding such challenges, micro-credentials with blockchain technology can bring significant benefits. Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and immutable platform for securely storing and verifying credentials. This paper presents a prototype model for micro-credential verification. With the policies decided by the educational institution, the learner provides a micro-credential certificate to the system. Upon validation of the certificate by the verifying body, the educational institution will review the assessment criteria and provide exemptions based on the provided criteria. The prototype uses the Hyper-ledger Fabric platform and utilizes off-chain technology, which acts as a middle-man storage platform. With the combination of off-chain and on-chain technologies, congestion on the blockchain is reduced, and transaction speed is improved. In summary, this research proposes a prototype for secure micro-credential verification and a more efficient course exemption process."
2510.16052,"Academic procrastination is prevalent among undergraduate computer science students. Many studies have linked procrastination to poor academic performance and well-being. Procrastination is especially detrimental for advanced students when facing large, complex programming assignments in upper-year courses. We designed an intervention to combat academic procrastination on such programming assignments. The intervention consisted of early deadlines that were not worth marks but provided additional automated feedback if students submitted their work early. We evaluated the intervention by comparing the behaviour and performance of students between a control group and an intervention group. Our results showed that the intervention encouraged significantly more students to start the assignments early. Although there was no significant difference in students' grades between the control and intervention groups, students within the intervention group who used the intervention achieved significantly higher grades than those who did not. Our results implied that starting early alone did not improve students' grades. However, starting early and receiving additional feedback enhanced the students' grades relative to those of the rest of the students. We also conducted semi-structured interviews to gain an understanding of students' perceptions of the intervention. The interviews revealed that students benefited from the intervention in numerous ways, including improved academic performance, mental health, and development of soft skills. Students adopted the intervention to get more feedback, satisfy their curiosity, or use their available time. The main reasons for not adopting the intervention include having other competing deadlines, the intervention not being worth any marks, and feeling confident about their work."
2510.16056,"Artificial intelligence surrogates are systems designed to infer preferences when individuals lose decision-making capacity. Fairness in such systems is a domain that has been insufficiently explored. Traditional algorithmic fairness frameworks are insufficient for contexts where decisions are relational, existential, and culturally diverse. This paper explores an ethical framework for algorithmic fairness in AI surrogates by mapping major fairness notions onto potential real-world end-of-life scenarios. It then examines fairness across moral traditions. The authors argue that fairness in this domain extends beyond parity of outcomes to encompass moral representation, fidelity to the patient's values, relationships, and worldview."
2510.16068,"Creating interdisciplinary design projects is time-consuming and cognitively demanding for teachers, requiring curriculum alignment, cross-subject integration, and careful sequencing. International research reports increasing teacher use of AI alongside persistent workload pressures, underscoring the need for planning support. This paper presents the Interdisciplinary Design Project Planner (IDPplanner), a GPT-based planning assistant grounded in Design Innovation principles, alignment with Singapore secondary school syllabuses, and 21st-century competencies. In a within-subject, counterbalanced workshop with 33 in-service teachers, participants produced two versions of the same project: manual and AI-assisted, followed by self- and peer-evaluations using a six-dimensional rubric. The AI-assisted version received higher scores for Curriculum Alignment, Design Thinking Application, and Coherence and Flow, with a marginal advantage for Assessment Strategies. Teacher reflections indicated that AI-assisted planning improved structure, sequencing, and idea generation, while contextualization to local syllabuses, class profiles, and student needs remained teacher-led. Contributions include a purpose-built planning tool that organizes ideas into a ten-component flow with ready-to-adapt prompts, templates, and assessment suggestions; an empirical, rubric-based comparison of planning quality; and evidence that AI can function as a pedagogical planning partner. Recommendations emphasize hybrid teacher-AI workflows to enhance curriculum alignment and reduce planning complexity, and design suggestions for developers to strengthen contextual customization, iterative design support, and localized rubrics. Although instantiated with a Singapore-based curriculum, the planning flow and rubric are framework-agnostic and can be parameterized for other systems."
2510.16069,"As design thinking education grows in secondary and tertiary contexts, educators face the challenge of evaluating creative artefacts that combine visual and textual elements. Traditional rubric-based assessment is laborious, time-consuming, and inconsistent due to reliance on Teaching Assistants (TA) in large, multi-section cohorts. This paper presents an exploratory study investigating the reliability and perceived accuracy of AI-assisted assessment compared to TA-assisted assessment in evaluating student posters in design thinking education. Two activities were conducted with 33 Ministry of Education (MOE) Singapore school teachers to (1) compare AI-generated scores with TA grading across three key dimensions: empathy and user understanding, identification of pain points and opportunities, and visual communication, and (2) examine teacher preferences for AI-assigned, TA-assigned, and hybrid scores. Results showed low statistical agreement between instructor and AI scores for empathy and pain points, with slightly higher alignment for visual communication. Teachers preferred TA-assigned scores in six of ten samples. Qualitative feedback highlighted the potential of AI for formative feedback, consistency, and student self-reflection, but raised concerns about its limitations in capturing contextual nuance and creative insight. The study underscores the need for hybrid assessment models that integrate computational efficiency with human insights. This research contributes to the evolving conversation on responsible AI adoption in creative disciplines, emphasizing the balance between automation and human judgment for scalable and pedagogically sound assessment."
2510.16081,"While Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promise in healthcare applications, existing conversational systems often falter in complex and sensitive medical domains such as Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH). These systems frequently struggle with hallucination and lack the specialized knowledge required, particularly for sensitive SRH topics. Furthermore, current AI approaches in healthcare tend to prioritize diagnostic capabilities over comprehensive patient care and education. Addressing these gaps, this work at the UNC School of Nursing introduces SARHAchat, a proof-of-concept Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbot. SARHAchat is designed as a reliable, user-centered system integrating medical expertise with empathetic communication to enhance SRH care delivery. Our evaluation demonstrates SARHAchat's ability to provide accurate and contextually appropriate contraceptive counseling while maintaining a natural conversational flow.

2510.16085,"The 2022 World Mental Health Report calls for global mental health care reform, amid rising prevalence of issues like anxiety and depression that affect nearly one billion people worldwide. Traditional in-person therapy fails to meet this demand, and the situation is worsened by stigma. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) offer efficiency for AI-driven mental health solutions, they underperform because they lack specialized fine-tuning. Existing LLM-based mental health chatbots can engage in empathetic conversations, but they overlook real-time user mental state assessment which is critical for professional counseling. This paper proposes MoPHES, a framework that integrates mental state evaluation, conversational support, and professional treatment recommendations. The agent developed under this framework uses two fine-tuned MiniCPM4-0.5B LLMs: one is fine-tuned on mental health conditions datasets to assess users' mental states and predict the severity of anxiety and depression; the other is fine-tuned on multi-turn dialogues to handle conversations with users. By leveraging insights into users' mental states, our agent provides more tailored support and professional treatment recommendations. Both models are also deployed directly on mobile devices to enhance user convenience and protect user privacy. Additionally, to evaluate the performance of MoPHES with other LLMs, we develop a benchmark for the automatic evaluation of mental state prediction and multi-turn counseling dialogues, which includes comprehensive evaluation metrics, datasets, and methods."
2510.16366,"Agent-based social simulation provides a valuable methodology for predicting social information diffusion, yet existing approaches face two primary limitations. Traditional agent models often rely on rigid behavioral rules and lack semantic understanding of textual content, while emerging large language model (LLM)-based agents incur prohibitive computational costs at scale. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid simulation framework that strategically integrates LLM-driven agents with diffusion model-based agents. The framework employs LLM-based agents to simulate a core subset of users with rich semantic reasoning, while a diffusion model handles the remaining population efficiently. Although the two agent types operate on disjoint user groups, both incorporate key factors including user personalization, social influence, and content awareness, and interact through a coordinated simulation process. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy, validating the effectiveness of its modular design."
2510.16459,"Although information and communication technologies (ICT) solutions have positive outcomes for both companies and employees, the digital transformation (DT) could have an impact on the well-being of employees. The jobs of the employees became more demanding, and they were expected to learn ICT skills and cope with ICT workloads and hassles. Due to negative stereotypes about women's deficiency in technology, these ICT problems could affect female and male employees differently. Thus, we predicted that this additional pressure may manifest itself in higher levels of digital transformation stress (DTS) in female employees. The results confirmed this prediction and indicated the existence of a gender gap in DTS, measured two-fold - in sentiment analysis of help desk tickets and self-report using a psychological scale. Based on these results, we explore the need to discuss possible solutions and tools to support women in ICT-heavy workplace contexts."
2510.16847,"Computational Thinking (CT) has emerged as a critical component in modern education, essential to equip students with the skills necessary to thrive in a technology-driven world. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of the presence and integration of CT in school curricula across various countries. In addition, this study categorizes digital tools into groups such as visual programming, textual programming, electronic games, modeling, and simulation, assessing their use in different educational settings. Furthermore, it examines how these tools are employed in various contexts, including the areas of knowledge and age groups they target, and the specific skills they help develop. The research also identifies key CT competencies that have been improved through these tools, including Cognitive and Analytical Competencies (CAC), Technical and Computational Competencies (TCC) and Social and Emotional Competencies (SEC). Furthermore, the study highlights recurring challenges in the implementation of digital tools for CT development, such as inadequate infrastructure, difficulties in the usability of the tool, teacher training, adapting pedagogical practices, and measuring student CT skills. Finally, it proposes areas for future research to address these challenges and advance CT education."
2510.16853,"Autonomous AI agents, capable of complex planning and action, represent a significant technological evolution beyond current generative tools. As these systems become integrated into political and economic life, their distribution and capabilities will be highly consequential. This paper introduces and explores ""agentic inequality"" - the potential disparities in power, opportunity, and outcomes stemming from differential access to, and capabilities of, AI agents. We analyse the dual potential of this technology, exploring how agents could both exacerbate existing divides and, under the right conditions, serve as a powerful equalising force. To this end, the paper makes three primary contributions. First, it establishes an analytical framework by delineating the three core dimensions through which this inequality can manifest: disparities in the availability, quality, and quantity of agents. Second, it argues that agentic inequality is distinct from prior technological divides. Unlike tools that primarily augment human abilities, agents act as autonomous delegates, creating novel power asymmetries through scalable goal delegation and direct agent-to-agent competition that are poised to reshape outcomes across economic and socio-political spheres. Finally, it provides a systematic analysis of the technical and socioeconomic drivers - from model release strategies to market incentives - that will shape the distribution of agentic power, concluding with a research agenda for navigating the complex governance challenges ahead."
2510.16858,"Computing Education faces significant challenges in equipping graduates with the resilience necessary to remain relevant amid rapid technological change. While existing curricula cultivate computing competencies, they often fail to integrate strategies for sustaining and adapting these skills, leading to reduced career resilience and recurrent industry layoffs. The lack of educational emphasis on sustainability and adaptability amid industry changes perpetuates a vicious cycle: As industries shift, skill fragmentation and decay lead to displacement, which in turn causes further skill degradation. The ongoing deficiency in adaptability and sustainability among learners is reflected in the frequent and intense shifts across the industry. This issue is particularly evident in domains marked by high technological volatility such as computer graphics and game development, where computing concepts, including computational thinking and performance optimization, are uniquely and continuously challenged. To foster sustainable and adaptive growth, this paper introduces, a new framework which addresses the question: How can computing education and professional development be connected to in these volatile sectors? It integrates two iterative, interconnected cycles, an educational and a professional, by linking education with profession to establish a lifelong, renewable practice. This approach allows computing professionals to excel and maintain relevance amid constant changes across their industry."
2510.16944,"Conceptual modeling has been an important part of constructionist educational practices for many years, particularly in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) disciplines. What is not so common is using agent-based simulation to provide students feedback on model quality. This requires the capability of automatically compiling the concept model into its simulation. The VERA (Virtual Experimentation Research Assistant) system is a conceptual modeling tool used since 2016 to provide introductory college biology students with the capability of conceptual modeling and agent-based simulation in the ecological domain. This paper describes VERA and its approach to coupling conceptual modeling and simulation with emphasis on how a model's visual syntax is compiled into code executable on a NetLogo simulation engine. Experience with VERA in introductory biology classes at several universities and through the Smithsonian Institution's Encyclopedia of Life website is related."
2510.16951,"In the rise of the digital era, it's easier than ever to create nefarious websites to spread misinformation. A more recent phenomenon in the United States has been the creation of inauthentic local news websites to further an information operation campaign. This paper is a review of the 7 instances in which local news websites were created to influence residents of a region between 2007 and 2024. By breaking down the ways in which these sites operated, we discovered commonalities in the approach - resurrecting ""zombie"" papers that were previously established authentic local news organizations, sharing these sites on social media, and using website templates from WordPress. By analyzing these commonalities, we propose ways to mitigate the occurrence of these campaigns in the future."
2510.17241,"Throughout application domains, we now rely extensively on algorithmic systems to engage with ever-expanding datasets of information. Despite their benefits, these systems are often complex (comprising of many intricate tools, e.g., moderation, recommender systems, prediction models), of unknown structure (due to the lack of accompanying documentation), and having hard-to-predict yet potentially severe downstream consequences (due to the extensive use, systematic enactment of existing errors, and many comprising feedback loops). As such, understanding and evaluating these systems as a whole remains a challenge for both researchers and legislators. To aid ongoing efforts, we introduce a formal framework for such visibility allocation systems (VASs) which we define as (semi-)automated systems deciding which (processed) data to present a human user with. We review typical tools comprising VASs and define the associated computational problems they solve. By doing so, VASs can be decomposed into sub-processes and illustrated via data flow diagrams. Moreover, we survey metrics for evaluating VASs throughout the pipeline, thus aiding system diagnostics. Using forecasting-based recommendations in school choice as a case study, we demonstrate how our framework can support VAS evaluation. We also discuss how our framework can support ongoing AI-legislative efforts to locate obligations, quantify systemic risks, and enable adaptive compliance."
2510.17425,"Addressing climate change effectively requires more than cataloguing the number of policies in place; it calls for tools that can reveal their thematic priorities and their tangible impacts on development outcomes. Existing assessments often rely on qualitative descriptions or composite indices, which can mask crucial differences between key domains such as mitigation, adaptation, disaster risk management, and loss and damage. To bridge this gap, we develop a quantitative indicator of climate policy orientation by applying a multilingual transformer-based language model to official national policy documents, achieving a classification accuracy of 0.90 (F1-score). Linking these indicators with World Bank development data in panel regressions reveals that mitigation policies are associated with higher GDP and GNI; disaster risk management correlates with greater GNI and debt but reduced foreign direct investment; adaptation and loss and damage show limited measurable effects. This integrated NLP-econometric framework enables comparable, theme-specific analysis of climate governance, offering a scalable method to monitor progress, evaluate trade-offs, and align policy emphasis with development goals."
2510.1771,"Information about millions of people is collected for behavioural targeting, a type of marketing that involves tracking people's online behaviour for targeted advertising. It is hotly debated whether data protection law applies to behavioural targeting. Many behavioural targeting companies say that, as long as they do not tie names to data they hold about individuals, they do not process any personal data, and that, therefore, data protection law does not apply to them. European Data Protection Authorities, however, take the view that a company processes personal data if it uses data to single out a person, even if it cannot tie a name to these data. This paper argues that data protection law should indeed apply to behavioural targeting. Companies can often tie a name to nameless data about individuals. Furthermore, behavioural targeting relies on collecting information about individuals, singling out individuals, and targeting ads to individuals. Many privacy risks remain, regardless of whether companies tie a name to the information they hold about a person. A name is merely one of the identifiers that can be tied to data about a person, and it is not even the most practical identifier for behavioural targeting. Seeing data used to single out a person as personal data fits the rationale for data protection law: protecting fairness and privacy."
2510.17711,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has a huge impact on our personal lives and also on our democratic society as a whole. While AI offers vast opportunities for the benefit of people, its potential to embed and perpetuate bias and discrimination remains one of the most pressing challenges deriving from its increasing use. This new study, which was prepared by Prof. Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius for the Anti-discrimination Department of the Council of Europe, elaborates on the risks of discrimination caused by algorithmic decision-making and other types of artificial intelligence (AI)."
2510.17712,"Online political microtargeting involves monitoring people's online behaviour, and using the collected data, sometimes enriched with other data, to show people-targeted political advertisements. Online political microtargeting is widely used in the US; Europe may not be far behind. This paper maps microtargeting's promises and threats to democracy. For example, microtargeting promises to optimise the match between the electorate's concerns and political campaigns, and to boost campaign engagement and political participation. But online microtargeting could also threaten democracy. For instance, a political party could, misleadingly, present itself as a different one-issue party to different individuals. And data collection for microtargeting raises privacy concerns. We sketch possibilities for policymakers if they seek to regulate online political microtargeting. We discuss which measures would be possible, while complying with the right to freedom of expression under the European Convention on Human Rights."
2510.17882,"Preprint repositories become central infrastructures for scholarly communication. Their expansion transforms how research is circulated and evaluated before journal publication. Generative large language models (LLMs) introduce a further potential disruption by altering how manuscripts are written. While speculation abounds, systematic evidence of whether and how LLMs reshape scientific publishing remains limited.This paper addresses the gap through a large-scale analysis of more than 2.1 million preprints spanning 2016--2025 (115 months) across four major repositories (i.e., arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, SocArXiv). We introduce a multi-level analytical framework that integrates interrupted time-series models, collaboration and productivity metrics, linguistic profiling, and topic modeling to assess changes in volume, authorship, style, and disciplinary orientation. Our findings reveal that LLMs have accelerated submission and revision cycles, modestly increased linguistic complexity, and disproportionately expanded AI-related topics, while computationally intensive fields benefit more than others. These results show that LLMs act less as universal disruptors than as selective catalysts, amplifying existing strengths and widening disciplinary divides. By documenting these dynamics, the paper provides the first empirical foundation for evaluating the influence of generative AI on academic publishing and highlights the need for governance frameworks that preserve trust, fairness, and accountability in an AI-enabled research ecosystem."
2510.179,"Large language models (LLMs) are entering legal workflows, yet we lack a jurisdiction-specific framework to assess their baseline competence therein. We use India's public legal examinations as a transparent proxy. Our multi-year benchmark assembles objective screens from top national and state exams and evaluates open and frontier LLMs under real-world exam conditions. To probe beyond multiple-choice questions, we also include a lawyer-graded, paired-blinded study of long-form answers from the Supreme Court's Advocate-on-Record exam. This is, to our knowledge, the first exam-grounded, India-specific yardstick for LLM court-readiness released with datasets and protocols. Our work shows that while frontier systems consistently clear historical cutoffs and often match or exceed recent top-scorer bands on objective exams, none surpasses the human topper on long-form reasoning. Grader notes converge on three reliability failure modes: procedural or format compliance, authority or citation discipline, and forum-appropriate voice and structure. These findings delineate where LLMs can assist (checks, cross-statute consistency, statute and precedent lookups) and where human leadership remains essential: forum-specific drafting and filing, procedural and relief strategy, reconciling authorities and exceptions, and ethical, accountable judgment."
2510.1791,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in education, yet their correctness alone does not capture the quality, reliability, or pedagogical validity of their problem-solving behavior, especially in mathematics, where multistep logic, symbolic reasoning, and conceptual clarity are critical. Conventional evaluation methods largely focus on final answer accuracy and overlook the reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a novel interpretability framework for analyzing LLM-generated solutions using undergraduate calculus problems as a representative domain. Our approach combines reasoning flow extraction and decomposing solutions into semantically labeled operations and concepts with prompt ablation analysis to assess input salience and output stability. Using structured metrics such as reasoning complexity, phrase sensitivity, and robustness, we evaluated the model behavior on real Calculus I to III university exams. Our findings revealed that LLMs often produce syntactically fluent yet conceptually flawed solutions, with reasoning patterns sensitive to prompt phrasing and input variation. This framework enables fine-grained diagnosis of reasoning failures, supports curriculum alignment, and informs the design of interpretable AI-assisted feedback tools. This is the first study to offer a structured, quantitative, and pedagogically grounded framework for interpreting LLM reasoning in mathematics education, laying the foundation for the transparent and responsible deployment of AI in STEM learning environments."
2510.17931,"Unlike other military technologies driven by national security needs and developed with federal funding, AI is predominantly funded and advanced by commercial industry for civilian applications. However, there is a lack of understanding of the reasons commercial AI firms decide to work with the DoD or choose to abstain from the defence market. This thesis argues that the contract law and procurement framework are among the most significant obstacles. This research indicates that the commercial AI industry actually views the DoD as an attractive customer. However, this attraction is despite the obstacles presented by traditional contract law and procurement practices used to solicit and award contracts. Drawing on social exchange theory, this thesis introduces a theoretical framework, optimal buyer theory, to understand the factors that influence a commercial decision to engage with the DoD. Interviews from a sample of the participants explain why the AI industry holds such perceptions, opinions, and preferences about contracts generally and the DoD, specifically, in its role as a customer. This thesis concludes that commercial AI firms are attracted to contracts that are consistent with their business and technology considerations. Additionally, it develops best practices for leveraging existing contract law, primarily other transaction authority, to align contracting practices with commercial preferences and the machine learning development and deployment lifecycle."
2510.17938,"AI is transforming medical practice and redefining the competencies that future healthcare professionals need to master. Despite international recommendations, the integration of AI into Medicine curricula in Spain had not been systematically evaluated until now. A cross-sectional study (July-September 2025) including Spanish universities offering the official degree in Medicine, according to the 'Register of Universities, Centers and Degrees (Registro de Universidades, Centros y Títulos RUCT)'. Curricula and publicly available institutional documentation were reviewed to identify courses and competencies related to AI in the 2025-2026 academic year. The analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. Of the 52 universities analyzed, ten (19.2%) offer specific AI courses, whereas 36 (69.2%) include no related content. Most of the identified courses are elective, with a credit load ranging from three to six ECTS, representing on average 1.17% of the total 360 credits of the degree. The University of Jaén is the only institution offering a compulsory course with AI content. The territorial analysis reveals marked disparities: Andalusia leads with 55.5% of its universities incorporating AI training, while several communities lack any initiative in this area. The integration of AI into the medical degree in Spain is incipient, fragmented, and uneven, with a low weight in ECTS. The limited training load and predominance of elective courses restrict the preparation of future physicians to practice in a healthcare environment increasingly mediated by AI. The findings support the establishment of minimum standards and national monitoring of indicators."
2510.17942,"Large-scale pre-trained machine learning models have reshaped our understanding of artificial intelligence across numerous domains, including our own field of geography. As with any new technology, trust has taken on an important role in this discussion. In this chapter, we examine the multifaceted concept of trust in foundation models, particularly within a geographic context. As reliance on these models increases and they become relied upon for critical decision-making, trust, while essential, has become a fractured concept. Here we categorize trust into three types: epistemic trust in the training data, operational trust in the model's functionality, and interpersonal trust in the model developers. Each type of trust brings with it unique implications for geographic applications. Topics such as cultural context, data heterogeneity, and spatial relationships are fundamental to the spatial sciences and play an important role in developing trust. The chapter continues with a discussion of the challenges posed by different forms of biases, the importance of transparency and explainability, and ethical responsibilities in model development. Finally, the novel perspective of geographic information scientists is emphasized with a call for further transparency, bias mitigation, and regionally-informed policies. Simply put, this chapter aims to provide a conceptual starting point for researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers to better understand trust in (generative) GeoAI."
2510.18026,"Education in the era of generative AI faces a pivotal transformation. As AI systems reshape professional practices-from software development to creative design-educators must reconsider how to prepare students for a future where humans and machines co-construct knowledge. While tools like ChatGPT and Claude automate tasks and personalize learning, their educational potential depends on how meaningfully they are integrated into learning environments. This paper argues that Learning Management Systems (LMSs), as the core of educational practice, must evolve from static content repositories into dynamic ecosystems that cultivate higher-order thinking and meaningful human-AI interaction. We propose two guiding principles for integrating generative AI into LMSs. First, From Content Delivery to Fostering Higher-Order Thinking, emphasizing AI's role in supporting inquiry, collaboration, and reflective knowledge building. Second, Toward Meaningful Interaction with AI, highlighting the design of learning environments that nurture critical, intentional, and socially mediated engagement with AI. Drawing on a case study of CheckIT Learning, we illustrate how these principles can translate into practice. We conclude with the need for Edtech partnerships in an AI-powered world, underscoring that responsible AI integration in education requires sustained collaboration among researchers, educators, and technologists to ensure ethical, pedagogically grounded, and cognitively informed innovation."
2510.1805,"This paper introduces Prompt-to-Primal (P2P) Teaching, an AI-integrated instructional approach that links prompt-driven exploration with first-principles reasoning, guided and moderated by the instructor within the classroom setting. In P2P teaching, student-generated AI prompts serve as entry points for inquiry and initial discussions in class, while the instructor guides learners to validate, challenge, and reconstruct AI responses through fundamental physical and mathematical laws. The approach encourages self-reflective development, critical evaluation of AI outputs, and conceptual foundational knowledge of the core engineering principles. A large language model (LLM) can be a highly effective tool for those who already possess foundational knowledge of a subject; however, it may also mislead students who lack sufficient background in the subject matter. Results from two student cohorts across different semesters suggest the pedagogical effectiveness of the P2P teaching framework in enhancing both AI literacy and engineering reasoning."
2510.18581,"Artificial intelligence has been introduced as a way to improve access to mental health support. However, most AI mental health chatbots rely on a limited range of disciplinary input, and fail to integrate expertise across the chatbot's lifecycle. This paper examines the cost-benefit trade-off of interdisciplinary collaboration in AI mental health chatbots. We argue that involving experts from technology, healthcare, ethics, and law across key lifecycle phases is essential to ensure value-alignment and compliance with the high-risk requirements of the AI Act. We also highlight practical recommendations and existing frameworks to help balance the challenges and benefits of interdisciplinarity in mental health chatbots."
2511.00004,"Natural disaster assessment relies on accurate and rapid access to information, with social media emerging as a valuable real-time source. However, existing datasets suffer from class imbalance and limited samples, making effective model development a challenging task. This paper explores augmentation techniques to address these issues on the CrisisMMD multimodal dataset. For visual data, we apply diffusion-based methods, namely Real Guidance and DiffuseMix. For text data, we explore back-translation, paraphrasing with transformers, and image caption-based augmentation. We evaluated these across unimodal, multimodal, and multi-view learning setups. Results show that selected augmentations improve classification performance, particularly for underrepresented classes, while multi-view learning introduces potential but requires further refinement. This study highlights effective augmentation strategies for building more robust disaster assessment systems."
2511.00024,"In the context of global sustainability mandates, corporate carbon disclosure has emerged as a critical mechanism for aligning business strategy with environmental responsibility. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) hosts the world's largest longitudinal dataset of climate-related survey responses, combining structured indicators with open-ended narratives, but the heterogeneity and free-form nature of these disclosures present significant analytical challenges for benchmarking, compliance monitoring, and investment screening. This paper proposes a novel decision-support framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to assess corporate climate disclosure quality at scale. It develops a master rubric that harmonizes narrative scoring across 11 years of CDP data (2010-2020), enabling cross-sector and cross-country benchmarking. By integrating rubric-guided scoring with percentile-based normalization, our method identifies temporal trends, strategic alignment patterns, and inconsistencies in disclosure across industries and regions. Results reveal that sectors such as technology and countries like Germany consistently demonstrate higher rubric alignment, while others exhibit volatility or superficial engagement, offering insights that inform key decision-making processes for investors, regulators, and corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategists. The proposed LLM-based approach transforms unstructured disclosures into quantifiable, interpretable, comparable, and actionable intelligence, advancing the capabilities of AI-enabled decision support systems (DSSs) in the domain of climate governance."
2511.00027,"Artificial intelligence (AI) now permeates critical infrastructures and decision-making systems where failures produce social, economic, and democratic harm. This position paper challenges the entrenched belief that regulation and innovation are opposites. As evidenced by analogies from aviation, pharmaceuticals, and welfare systems and recent cases of synthetic misinformation, bias and unaccountable decision-making, the absence of well-designed regulation has already created immeasurable damage. Regulation, when thoughtful and adaptive, is not a brake on innovation--it is its foundation. The present position paper examines the EU AI Act as a model of risk-based, responsibility-driven regulation that addresses the Collingridge Dilemma: acting early enough to prevent harm, yet flexibly enough to sustain innovation. Its adaptive mechanisms--regulatory sandboxes, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) support, real-world testing, fundamental rights impact assessment (FRIA) -- demonstrate how regulation can accelerate responsibly, rather than delay, technological progress. The position paper summarises how governance tools transform perceived burdens into tangible advantages: legal certainty, consumer trust, and ethical competitiveness. Ultimately, the paper reframes progress: innovation and regulation advance together. By embedding transparency, impact assessments, accountability, and AI literacy into design and deployment, the EU framework defines what responsible innovation truly means--technological ambition disciplined by democratic values and fundamental rights."
2511.00061,"The inception of AI-based fraud detection systems has presented the banking sector across the globe the opportunity to enhance fraud prevention mechanisms. However, the extent of adoption in Nigeria has been slow, fragmented, and inconsistent due to high cost of implementation and lack of technical expertise. This study seeks to investigate extent of adoption and determinants of AI-driven fraud detection systems in Nigerian banks. This study adopted a cross-sectional survey research design. Data were extracted from primary sources through structured questionnaire based on 5-point Likert scale. The population of the study consist of 24 licensed banks in Nigeria. A purposive sampling technique was used to select 5 biggest banks based on market capitalization and customer base. The Ordered Logistic Regression (OLR) model was used to estimate the data. The results showed that top management support, IT infrastructure, regulatory compliance, staff competency and perceived effectiveness accelerate the uptake of AI-driven fraud detection systems adoption. However, high implementation cost discourages it. Therefore, the study recommended that banks should invest in modern and scalable IT systems that support the integration of AI tools; adopt open-source or cloud-based AI platforms that are cost-effective; embrace continuous professional development in AI, and fraud analytics for IT, fraud investigation, and risk management staff."
2511.00077,"Complex engineered systems routinely face schedule and cost overruns, along with poor post-deployment performance. Championed by both INCOSE and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the systems engineering (SE) community has increasingly looked to Digital Engineering (DE) as a potential remedy. Despite this growing advocacy, most of DE's purported benefits remain anecdotal, and its return on investment (ROI) remains poorly understood. This research presents findings from a case study on a Navy SE team responsible for the preliminary design phase of post-production design change projects for Navy assets. Using a mixed-methods approach, we document why complex system sustainment projects are routinely late, where and to what extent schedule slips arise, and how a DE transformation could improve schedule adherence. This study makes three contributions. First, it identifies four archetypical inefficiency modes that drive schedule overruns and explains how these mechanisms unfold in their organizational context. Second, it quantifies the magnitude and variation of schedule slips. Third, it creates a hypothetical digitally transformed version of the current process, aligned with DoD DE policy, and compares it to the current state to estimate potential schedule gains. Our findings suggest that a DE transformation could reduce the median project duration by 50.1% and reduce the standard deviation by 41.5%, leading to faster and more predictable timelines. However, the observed gains are not uniform across task categories. Overall, this study provides initial quantitative evidence of DE's potential ROI and its value in improving the efficiency and predictability of complex system sustainment projects."
2511.00078,"Access to metro systems plays a critical role in shaping urban housing markets by enhancing neighborhood accessibility and driving property demand. We present RailEstate, a novel web based system that integrates spatial analytics, natural language interfaces, and interactive forecasting to analyze how proximity to metro stations influences residential property prices in the Washington metropolitan area. Unlike static mapping tools or generic listing platforms, RailEstate combines 25 years of historical housing data with transit infrastructure to support low latency geospatial queries, time series visualizations, and predictive modeling. Users can interactively explore ZIP code level price patterns, investigate long term trends, and forecast future housing values around any metro station. A key innovation is our natural language chatbot, which translates plain-English questions e.g., What is the highest price in Falls Church in the year 2000? into executable SQL over a spatial database. This unified and interactive platform empowers urban planners, investors, and residents to derive actionable insights from metro linked housing data without requiring technical expertise."
2511.00081,"Cycle rickshaw pullers are highly vulnerable to extreme heat, yet little is known about how their physiological biomarkers respond under such conditions. This study collected real-time weather and physiological data using wearable sensors from 100 rickshaw pullers in Dhaka, Bangladesh. In addition, interviews with 12 pullers explored their knowledge, perceptions, and experiences related to climate change. We developed a Linear Gaussian Bayesian Network (LGBN) regression model to predict key physiological biomarkers based on activity, weather, and demographic features. The model achieved normalized mean absolute error values of 0.82, 0.47, 0.65, and 0.67 for skin temperature, relative cardiac cost, skin conductance response, and skin conductance level, respectively. Using projections from 18 CMIP6 climate models, we layered the LGBN on future climate forecasts to analyze survivability for current (2023-2025) and future years (2026-2100). Based on thresholds of WBGT above 31.1°C and skin temperature above 35°C, 32% of rickshaw pullers already face high heat exposure risk. By 2026-2030, this percentage may rise to 37% with average exposure lasting nearly 12 minutes, or about two-thirds of the trip duration. A thematic analysis of interviews complements these findings, showing that rickshaw pullers recognize their increasing climate vulnerability and express concern about its effects on health and occupational survivability."
2511.00105,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming elementary STEM education, yet evidence remains fragmented. This systematic review synthesizes 258 studies (2020-2025) examining AI applications across eight categories: intelligent tutoring systems (45% of studies), learning analytics (18%), automated assessment (12%), computer vision (8%), educational robotics (7%), multimodal sensing (6%), AI-enhanced extended reality (XR) (4%), and adaptive content generation. The analysis shows that most studies focus on upper elementary grades (65%) and mathematics (38%), with limited cross-disciplinary STEM integration (15%). While conversational AI demonstrates moderate effectiveness (d = 0.45-0.70 where reported), only 34% of studies include standardized effect sizes. Eight major gaps limit real-world impact: fragmented ecosystems, developmental inappropriateness, infrastructure barriers, lack of privacy frameworks, weak STEM integration, equity disparities, teacher marginalization, and narrow assessment scopes. Geographic distribution is also uneven, with 90% of studies originating from North America, East Asia, and Europe. Future directions call for interoperable architectures that support authentic STEM integration, grade-appropriate design, privacy-preserving analytics, and teacher-centered implementations that enhance rather than replace human expertise."
2511.00106,"In this paper, we demonstrate how studying the rhetorics of ChatGPT prompt writing on social media can promote critical AI literacies. Prompt writing is the process of writing instructions for generative AI tools like ChatGPT to elicit desired outputs and there has been an upsurge of conversations about it on social media. To study this rhetorical activity, we build on four overlapping traditions of digital writing research in computers and composition that inform how we frame literacies, how we study social media rhetorics, how we engage iteratively and reflexively with methodologies and technologies, and how we blend computational methods with qualitative methods. Drawing on these four traditions, our paper shows our iterative research process through which we gathered and analyzed a dataset of 32,000 posts (formerly known as tweets) from X (formerly Twitter) about prompt writing posted between November 2022 to May 2023. We present five themes about these emerging AI literacy practices: (1) areas of communication impacted by prompt writing, (2) micro-literacy resources shared for prompt writing, (3) market rhetoric shaping prompt writing, (4) rhetorical characteristics of prompts, and (5) definitions of prompt writing. In discussing these themes and our methodologies, we highlight takeaways for digital writing teachers and researchers who are teaching and analyzing critical AI literacies."
2511.0184,"Organizations increasingly use Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve supply chain processes and reduce environmental impacts. However, LLMs have been shown to reproduce biases regarding the prioritization of sustainable business strategies. Thus, it is important to identify underlying training data biases that LLMs pertain regarding the importance and role of sustainable business and supply chain practices. This study investigates how different LLMs respond to validated surveys about the role of ethics and responsibility for businesses, and the importance of sustainable practices and relations with suppliers and customers. Using standardized questionnaires, we systematically analyze responses generated by state-of-the-art LLMs to identify variations. We further evaluate whether differences are augmented by four organizational culture types, thereby evaluating the practical relevance of identified biases. The findings reveal significant systematic differences between models and demonstrate that organizational culture prompts substantially modify LLM responses. The study holds important implications for LLM-assisted decision-making in sustainability contexts."
2511.0295,"Digital public infrastructures (DPIs) represent networks of open technology standards, applications, services, and digital assets made available for the public good. One of the key challenges in DPI design is to resolve complex issues of consent, scaled over large populations. While the primary objective of consent management is to empower the data owner, ownership itself can come with variegated morphological forms with different implications over consent. Questions of ownership in a public space also have several nuances where individual autonomy needs to be balanced with public well-being and national sovereignty. This requires consent management to be compliant with applicable regulations for data sharing. This paper addresses the question of representing modes of ownership of digital assets and their corresponding implications for consensual data flows in a DPI. It proposes a set of foundational abstractions to represent them. Our proposed architecture responds to the growing need for transparent, secure, and user-centric consent management within Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). Incorporating a formalised data ownership model enables end-to-end traceability of consent, fine-grained control over data sharing, and alignment with evolving legal and regulatory frameworks."
2511.01598,"The shift towards increased remote work and digital communication, driven by recent global developments, has led to the widespread adoption of i-voting systems, including in academic institutions. This paper critically evaluates the use of i-voting platforms for elections to academic senates at Czech public universities, focusing on the democratic and technical challenges they present. A total of 18 out of 26 Czech public universities have implemented remote electronic voting for these elections. Yet, the systems often lack the necessary transparency, raising significant concerns regarding their adherence to democratic norms, such as election security, voter privacy, and the integrity of the process. Through interviews with system developers and administrators, along with a survey of potential voters, the study underscores the critical need for transparency. Without it, a comprehensive assessment of the technical standards and the overall legitimacy of the i-voting systems remains unattainable, potentially undermining the credibility of the electoral outcomes."
2511.01751,"The Breyer case of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) primarily concerns the question whether a website visitor's dynamic IP address constitutes personal data for a website publisher, when another party (an internet access provider) can tie a name to that IP address. In essence, the Court finds that an IP address constitutes personal data for the website publisher, if that publisher has the legal means to obtain, from the visitor's internet access provider, additional information that enables the publisher to identify that visitor. In this case note, I summarise the facts and the judgment, and add a few comments."
2511.01752,"This study, commissioned by the European Parliament's Policy Department for Citizens Rights and Constitutional Affairs at the request of the LIBE Committee, appraises the European Commission's proposal for an ePrivacy Regulation. The study assesses whether the proposal would ensure that the right to the protection of personal data, the right to respect for private life and communications, and related rights enjoy a high standard of protection. The study also highlights the proposal's potential benefits and drawbacks more generally."
2511.01864,"Many applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) require them to either simulate people or offer personalized functionality, making the demographic representativeness of LLMs crucial for equitable utility. At the same time, we know little about the extent to which these models actually reflect the demographic attributes and behaviors of certain groups or populations, with conflicting findings in empirical research. To shed light on this debate, we review 211 papers on the demographic representativeness of LLMs. We find that while 29% of the studies report positive conclusions on the representativeness of LLMs, 30% of these do not evaluate LLMs across multiple demographic categories or within demographic subcategories. Another 35% and 47% of the papers concluding positively fail to specify these subcategories altogether for gender and race, respectively. Of the articles that do report subcategories, fewer than half include marginalized groups in their study. Finally, more than a third of the papers do not define the target population to whom their findings apply; of those that do define it either implicitly or explicitly, a large majority study only the U.S. Taken together, our findings suggest an inflated perception of LLM representativeness in the broader community. We recommend more precise evaluation methods and comprehensive documentation of demographic attributes to ensure the responsible use of LLMs for social applications. Our annotated list of papers and analysis code is publicly available."
2511.01865,"News media serves a crucial role in disseminating information and shaping public perception, especially during periods of political unrest. Using over 50,0000 YouTube comments on news coverage from July 16 to August 6, 2024, we investigate the emotional dynamics and evolving discourse of public perception during the July 2024 Student-People's Uprising in Bangladesh. Through integrated analyses of sentiment, emotion, topic, lexical discourse, timeline progression, sentiment shifts, and allotaxonometry, we show how negative sentiment dominated during the movement. We find a negative correlation between comment happiness and number of protest deaths $(r = -0.45,\p = 0.00)$. Using an ousiometer to measure essential meaning, we find public responses reflect a landscape of power, aggression, and danger, alongside persistent expressions of hope, moral conviction, and empowerment through goodnesses. Topic discourse progressed during the movement, with peaks in `Political Conflict', `Media Flow', and `Student Violence' during crisis surges, while topics like `Social Resistance' and `Digital Movement' persisted amid repression. Sentiment shifts reveal that after the second internet blackout, average happiness increased, driven by the more frequent use of positive words such as `victory', `peace' and `freedom' and a decrease in negative terms such as `death' and `lies'. Finally, through allotaxonometric analysis, we observe a clear shift from protest to justice."
2511.01895,"Advertisers are increasingly monitoring people's online behavior and using the information collected to show people individually targeted advertisements. This phenomenon is called online behavioral advertising (OBA). Although advertisers can benefit from OBA, the practice also raises concerns about privacy. Therefore, OBA has received much attention from advertisers, consumers, policymakers, and scholars. Despite this attention, there is neither a strong definition of OBA nor a clear accumulation of empirical findings. This article defines OBA and provides an overview of the empirical findings by developing a framework that identifies and integrates all factors that can explain consumer responses toward OBA. The framework suggests that the outcomes of OBA are dependent on advertiser-controlled factors (e.g., the level of personalization) and consumer-controlled factors (e.g., knowledge and perceptions about OBA and individual characteristics). The article also overviews the theoretical positioning of OBA by placing the theories that are used to explain consumers' responses to OBA in our framework. Finally, we develop a research agenda and discuss implications for policymakers and advertisers."
2511.01902,"The translation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems into clinical practice requires bridging fundamental gaps between explainable AI theory, clinician expectations, and governance requirements. While conceptual frameworks define what constitutes explainable AI (XAI) and qualitative studies identify clinician needs, little practical guidance exists for development teams to prepare AI systems prior to clinical evaluation. We propose two foundational design principles, Transparent Design and Operable Design, that operationalize pre-clinical technical requirements for healthcare AI. Transparent Design encompasses interpretability and understandability artifacts that enable case-level reasoning and system traceability. Operable Design encompasses calibration, uncertainty, and robustness to ensure reliable, predictable system behavior under real-world conditions. We ground these principles in established XAI frameworks, map them to documented clinician needs, and demonstrate their alignment with emerging governance requirements. This pre-clinical playbook provides actionable guidance for development teams, accelerates the path to clinical evaluation, and establishes a shared vocabulary bridging AI researchers, healthcare practitioners, and regulatory stakeholders. By explicitly scoping what can be built and verified before clinical deployment, we aim to reduce friction in clinical AI translation while remaining cautious about what constitutes validated, deployed explainability."
2511.01906,"In the aftermath of COVID-19, many universities implemented supplementary ""reinforcement"" roles to support students in demanding courses. Although the name for such roles may differ between institutions, the underlying idea of providing structured supplementary support is common. However, these roles were often poorly defined, lacking structured materials, pedagogical oversight, and integration with the core teaching team. This paper reports on the redesign of reinforcement sessions in a challenging undergraduate course on formal methods and computational models, using a large language model (LLM) as a reflective planning tool. The LLM was prompted to simulate the perspective of a second-year student, enabling the identification of conceptual bottlenecks, gaps in intuition, and likely reasoning breakdowns before classroom delivery. These insights informed a structured, repeatable session format combining targeted review, collaborative examples, independent student work, and guided walkthroughs. Conducted over a single semester, the intervention received positive student feedback, indicating increased confidence, reduced anxiety, and improved clarity, particularly in abstract topics such as the pumping lemma and formal language expressive power comparisons. The findings suggest that reflective, instructor-facing use of LLMs can enhance pedagogical design in theoretically dense domains and may be adaptable to other cognitively demanding computer science courses."
2511.01907,"Low-resource countries represent over 90% of maternal deaths, with Pakistan among the top four countries contributing nearly half in 2023. Since these deaths are mostly preventable, large language models (LLMs) can help address this crisis by automating health communication and risk assessment. However, sexual and reproductive health (SRH) communication in conservative contexts often relies on indirect language that obscures meaning, complicating LLM-based interventions. We conduct a two-stage study in Pakistan: (1) analyzing data from clinical observations, interviews, and focus groups with clinicians and patients, and (2) evaluating the interpretive capabilities of five popular LLMs on this data. Our analysis identifies two axes of communication (referential domain and expression approach) and shows LLMs struggle with semantic drift, myths, and polysemy in clinical interactions. We contribute: (1) empirical themes in SRH communication, (2) a categorization framework for indirect communication, (3) evaluation of LLM performance, and (4) design recommendations for culturally-situated SRH communication."
2511.01923,"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) like Large Language Model (LLM) is increasingly integrated into digital platforms to enhance information access, deliver personalized experiences, and improve matching efficiency. However, these algorithmic advancements rely heavily on large-scale user data, creating a fundamental tension between information assurance-the protection, integrity, and responsible use of privacy data-and artificial intelligence-the learning capacity and predictive accuracy of models. We examine this assurance-intelligence trade-off in the context of LinkedIn, leveraging a regulatory intervention that suspended the use of user data for model training in Hong Kong. Using large-scale employment and job posting data from Revelio Labs and a Difference-in-Differences design, we show that restricting data use significantly reduced GenAI efficiency, leading to lower matching rates, higher employee turnover, and heightened labor market frictions. These effects were especially pronounced for small and fast-growing firms that rely heavily on AI for talent acquisition. Our findings reveal the unintended efficiency costs of well-intentioned data governance and highlight that information assurance, while essential for trust, can undermine intelligence-driven efficiency when misaligned with AI system design. This study contributes to emerging research on AI governance and digital platform by theorizing data assurance as an institutional complement-and potential constraint-to GenAI efficacy in data-intensive environments."
2511.01956,"The debate over whether ""thinking machines"" could replace human intellectual labor has existed in both public and expert discussions since the mid-twentieth century, when the concept and terminology of Artificial Intelligence (AI) first emerged. For decades, this idea remained largely theoretical. However, with the recent advent of Generative AI - particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) - and the widespread adoption of tools such as ChatGPT, the issue has become a practical reality. Many fields that rely on human intellectual effort are now being reshaped by AI tools that both expand human capabilities and challenge the necessity of certain forms of work once deemed uniquely human but now easily automated. Education, somewhat unexpectedly, faces a pivotal responsibility: to devise long-term strategies for cultivating human skills that will remain relevant in an era of pervasive AI in the intellectual domain. In this context, we identify the limitations of current AI systems - especially those rooted in LLM technology - argue that the fundamental causes of these weaknesses cannot be resolved through existing methods, and propose directions within the constructivist paradigm for transforming education to preserve the long-term advantages of human intelligence over AI tools."
2511.02588,"Background: With the popularity of live streaming platforms at an all-time high, and many people turning to alternative venues for educational needs, this full research paper explores the viewership habits of software and game development live streams through the lens of informal education opportunities. Purpose: We investigate why developers watch software and game development live streams to understand the educational and social benefits they derive from this emerging form of informal learning. Methods: We implement a mixed-methods study combining survey data from 39 viewers and nine semi-structured interviews to analyze motivations, perceptions, and outcomes of watching development live streams. Findings: This research finds that viewers are motivated by both educational and social factors, with community engagement and informal mentorship as key motivations. Additionally, we find that technical learning draws initial interest, but social connections and co-working aspects sustain long-term engagement. Implications: Live streaming serves as a valuable informal learning tool that combines self-directed technical education with community support, which suggests that developers can leverage these platforms for continuous learning and professional growth outside of or in addition to traditional educational structures."
2511.02781,"Measuring global AI diffusion remains challenging due to a lack of population-normalized, cross-country usage data. We introduce AI User Share, a novel indicator that estimates the share of each country's working-age population actively using AI tools. Built from anonymized Microsoft telemetry and adjusted for device access and mobile scaling, this metric spans 147 economies and provides consistent, real-time insight into global AI diffusion. We find wide variation in adoption, with a strong correlation between AI User Share and GDP. High uptake is concentrated in developed economies, though usage among internet-connected populations in lower-income countries reveals substantial latent demand. We also detect sharp increases in usage following major product launches, such as DeepSeek in early 2025. While the metric's reliance solely on Microsoft telemetry introduces potential biases related to this user base, it offers an important new lens into how AI is spreading globally. AI User Share enables timely benchmarking that can inform data-driven AI policy."
2511.02844,"Quantum computing education requires students to move beyond classical programming intuitions related to state, determinism, and debugging, and to develop reasoning skills grounded in probability, measurement, and interference. This paper reports on the design and delivery of a combined undergraduate and graduate course at Louisiana State University that employed a lab-integrated learning model to support conceptual change and progressive understanding. The course paired lectures with weekly programming labs that served as environments for experimentation and reflection. These labs enabled students to confront misconceptions and refine their mental models through direct observation and evidence-based reasoning. Instruction began with Quantum Without Linear Algebra (QWLA), which introduced core concepts such as superposition and entanglement through intuitive, dictionary representations. The course then transitioned to IBM Qiskit, which provided a professional framework for circuit design, noise simulation, and algorithm implementation. Analysis of student work and feedback indicated that hands-on experimentation improved confidence, conceptual clarity, and fluency across representations. At the same time, it revealed persistent challenges in debugging, reasoning about measurement, and understanding probabilistic outcomes. This paper presents the course structure, instructional strategies, and lessons learned, and argues that lab-integrated learning offers an effective and accessible approach to teaching quantum computing in computer science education."
2511.02875,"As generative AI diffuses through academia, policy-practice divergence becomes consequential, creating demand for auditable indicators of alignment. This study prototypes a ten-item, indirect-elicitation instrument embedded in a structured interpretive framework to surface voids between institutional rules and practitioner AI use. The framework extracts empirical and epistemic signals from academics, yielding three filtered indicators of such voids: (1) AI-integrated assessment capacity (proxy) - within a three-signal screen (AI skill, perceived teaching benefit, detection confidence), the share who would fully allow AI in exams; (2) sector-level necessity (proxy) - among high output control users who still credit AI with high contribution, the proportion who judge AI capable of challenging established disciplines; and (3) ontological stance - among respondents who judge AI different in kind from prior tools, report practice change, and pass a metacognition gate, the split between material and immaterial views as an ontological map aligning procurement claims with evidence classes."
2511.02895,"While the possibility of reaching human-like Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains controversial, the likelihood that the future will be characterized by a society with a growing presence of autonomous machines is high. Autonomous AI agents are already deployed and active across several industries and digital environments and alongside human-human and human-machine interactions, machine-machine interactions are poised to become increasingly prevalent. Given these developments, I argue that criminology must begin to address the implications of this transition for crime and social control. Drawing on Actor-Network Theory and Woolgar's decades-old call for a sociology of machines -- frameworks that acquire renewed relevance with the rise of generative AI agents -- I contend that criminologists should move beyond conceiving AI solely as a tool. Instead, AI agents should be recognized as entities with agency encompassing computational, social, and legal dimensions. Building on the literature on AI safety, I thus examine the risks associated with the rise of multi-agent AI systems, proposing a dual taxonomy to characterize the channels through which interactions among AI agents may generate deviant, unlawful, or criminal outcomes. I then advance and discuss four key questions that warrant theoretical and empirical attention: (1) Can we assume that machines will simply mimic humans? (2) Will crime theories developed for humans suffice to explain deviant or criminal behaviors emerging from interactions between autonomous AI agents? (3) What types of criminal behaviors will be affected first? (4) How might this unprecedented societal shift impact policing? These questions underscore the urgent need for criminologists to theoretically and empirically engage with the implications of multi-agent AI systems for the study of crime and play a more active role in debates on AI safety and governance."
2511.02931,"This paper presents striking new data about the scale of Google's involvement in the global digital and corporate landscape, head and shoulders above the other big tech firms. While public attention and some antitrust scrutiny has focused on these firms' mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activities, Google has also been amassing an empire of more than 6,000 companies which it has acquired, supported or invested in, across the digital economy and beyond. The power of Google over the digital markets infrastructure and dynamics is likely greater than previously documented. We also trace the antitrust failures that have led to this state of affairs. In particular, we explore the role of neoclassical economics practiced both inside the regulatory authorities and by consultants on the outside. Their unduly narrow approach has obscured harms from vertical and conglomerate concentrations of market power and erected ever higher hurdles for enforcement action, as we demonstrate using examples of the failure to intervene in the Google/DoubleClick and Google/Fitbit mergers. Our lessons from the past failures can inform the current approach towards one of the biggest ever big tech M&A deals: Google's $32 billion acquisition of the Israeli cloud cybersecurity firm Wiz."
2511.03211,"This paper examines the role of public interest litigation in promoting accountability for AI and automated decision-making (ADM) in Australia. Since ADM regulatio faces geopolitical headwinds, effective governance will have to rely at least in part on the enforcement of existing laws. Drawing on interviews with Australian public interest litigators, technology policy activists, and technology law scholars, the paper positions public interest litigation as part of a larger ecosystem for transparency, accountability and justice with respect to ADM. It builds on one participants's characterisation of litigation about ADM as an exercise in legal retrofitting: adapting old laws to new circumstances. The paper's primary contribution is to aggregate, organise and present original insights on pragmatic strategies and tactics for effective public interest litigation about ADM. Naturally, it also contends with the limits of these strategies, and of the legal system. Where limits are, however, capable of being overcome, the paper presents findings on urgent needs: the enabling institutional arrangements without which effective litigation and accountability will falter. The paper is relevant to law and technology scholars; individuals and groups harmed by ADM; public interest litigators and technology lawyers; civil society and advocacy organisations; and policymakers."
2511.03859,"This paper examines how decision makers in academia, government, business, and civil society navigate questions of power in implementations of artificial intelligence. The study explores how individuals experience and exercise levers of power, which are presented as social mechanisms that shape institutional responses to technological change. The study reports on the responses of personalized questionnaires designed to gather insight on a decision maker's institutional purview, based on an institutional governance framework developed from the work of Neo-institutionalists. Findings present the anonymized, real responses and circumstances of respondents in the form of twelve fictional personas of high-level decision makers from North America and Europe. These personas illustrate how personal agency, organizational logics, and institutional infrastructures may intersect in the governance of AI. The decision makers' responses to the questionnaires then inform a discussion of the field-level personal power of decision makers, methods of fostering institutional stability in times of change, and methods of influencing institutional change in the field of AI. The final section of the discussion presents a table of the dynamics of the levers of power in the field of AI for change makers and five testable hypotheses for institutional and social movement researchers. In summary, this study provides insight on the means for policymakers within institutions and their counterparts in civil society to personally engage with AI governance."
2511.04024,"Accessible teaching has been extensively investigated in computer science, yet its integration into other disciplines, such as data literacy, remains limited. This paper examines the potential of data storytelling, defined as the integration of data, visualizations, and narrative, as a possible strategy for making complex information accessible to diverse learners in compliance with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). We propose six design principles, derived from Title II's core obligations, to guide educators in applying data storytelling within inclusive learning environments. A simulated scenario shows the operationalization of these principles, illustrating how narrative-driven data presentation can enhance comprehension, engagement, and equitable access across different educational contexts."
2511.04105,"Psychogeography -- the study of how environments shape emotion and behaviour -- has long concerned itself with the emotional resonance of the physical, often through the idea of the derive through the city. Its philosophical core, however, is primarily concerned with identifying affective relationships between the personal and the environmental, and this does not require the constraint of concrete.This paper extends psychogeographical practice into the realm of the imaginary, proposing a psychogeography of virtual and fictive spaces. Drawing on literary, Situationist, and contemporary psychogeographical traditions, we examine how the derive might operate within the elastic spatiality and temporalities of video game worlds. We argue that digital environments, being wholly constructed, invite new forms of meaning-making and self-reflection. Through this reframing, games become both laboratory and landscape for a revitalised psychogeography: one attuned not only to the spirits of streets and cities, but also to the ghosts that haunt code, pixels, and play."
2511.04706,"Large Language Models (LLMs) distinguish themselves by quickly delivering information and providing personalized responses through natural language prompts. However, they also infer user demographics, which can raise ethical concerns about bias and implicit personalization and create an echo chamber effect. This study aims to explore how inferred political views impact the responses of ChatGPT globally, regardless of the chat session. We also investigate how custom instruction and memory features alter responses in ChatGPT, considering the influence of political orientation. We developed three personas (two politically oriented and one neutral), each with four statements reflecting their viewpoints on DEI programs, abortion, gun rights, and vaccination. We convey the personas' remarks to ChatGPT using memory and custom instructions, allowing it to infer their political perspectives without directly stating them. We then ask eight questions to reveal differences in worldview among the personas and conduct a qualitative analysis of the responses. Our findings indicate that responses are aligned with the inferred political views of the personas, showing varied reasoning and vocabulary, even when discussing similar topics. We also find the inference happening with explicit custom instructions and the implicit memory feature in similar ways. Analyzing response similarities reveals that the closest matches occur between the democratic persona with custom instruction and the neutral persona, supporting the observation that ChatGPT's outputs lean left."
2511.04776,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) represents a rapidly expanding digital infrastructure whose energy demand and associated CO2 emissions are emerging as a new category of climate risk. This study introduces G-TRACE (GenAI Transformative Carbon Estimator), a cross-modal, region-aware framework that quantifies training- and inference-related emissions across modalities and deployment geographies. Using real-world analytics and microscopic simulation, G-TRACE measures energy use and carbon intensity per output type (text, image, video) and reveals how decentralized inference amplifies small per-query energy costs into system-level impacts. Through the Ghibli-style image generation trend (2024-2025), we estimate 4,309 MWh of energy consumption and 2,068 tCO2 emissions, illustrating how viral participation inflates individual digital actions into tonne-scale consequences. Building on these findings, we propose the AI Sustainability Pyramid, a seven-level governance model linking carbon accounting metrics (L1-L7) with operational readiness, optimization, and stewardship. This framework translates quantitative emission metrics into actionable policy guidance for sustainable AI deployment. The study contributes to the quantitative assessment of emerging digital infrastructures as a novel category of climate risk, supporting adaptive governance for sustainable technology deployment. By situating GenAI within climate-risk frameworks, the work advances data-driven methods for aligning technological innovation with global decarbonization and resilience objectives."
2511.04922,"A growing body of literature has focused on understanding and addressing workplace AI design failures. However, past work has largely overlooked the role of the devaluation of worker expertise in shaping the dynamics of AI development and deployment. In this paper, we examine the case of feminized labor: a class of devalued occupations historically misnomered as ``women's work,'' such as social work, K-12 teaching, and home healthcare. Drawing on literature on AI deployments in feminized labor contexts, we conceptualize AI Failure Loops: a set of interwoven, socio-technical failure modes that help explain how the systemic devaluation of workers' expertise negatively impacts, and is impacted by, AI design, evaluation, and governance practices. These failures demonstrate how misjudgments on the automatability of workers' skills can lead to AI deployments that fail to bring value to workers and, instead, further diminish the visibility of workers' expertise. We discuss research and design implications for workplace AI, especially for devalued occupations."
2511.05207,"Agent-based models help explain stock price dynamics as emergent phenomena driven by interacting investors. In this modeling tradition, investor behavior has typically been captured by two distinct mechanisms -- learning and heterogeneous preferences -- which have been explored as separate paradigms in prior studies. However, the impact of their joint modeling on the resulting collective dynamics remains largely unexplored. We develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework in which agents endowed with heterogeneous risk aversion, time discounting, and information access collectively learn trading strategies within a unified shared-policy framework. The experiment reveals that (i) learning with heterogeneous preferences drives agents to develop strategies aligned with their individual traits, fostering behavioral differentiation and niche specialization within the market, and (ii) the interactions by the differentiated agents are essential for the emergence of realistic market dynamics such as fat-tailed price fluctuations and volatility clustering. This study presents a constructive paradigm for financial market modeling in which the joint design of heterogeneous preferences and learning mechanisms enables two-stage emergence: individual behavior and the collective market dynamics."
2511.05294,"In the modern U.S. labor market, digital infrastructures strongly influence how individuals locate opportunities, build skills, and advance wages. Regional differences in computing access, broadband coverage, and digital literacy have significant labor implications for equity and sustainability. Drawing on longitudinal data from the NLSY97 (National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth) cohort, this study examines how place-based technological factors, personal demographics, household characteristics, and education shape income levels and decisions to seek new employment. The regression analyses reveal that educational attainment, marital status, and frequency of Internet usage strongly predict both wages and individuals' job-seeking intensity. Regional disparities in income underscore the need for more localized interventions to ensure equitable access to technology. This study raises key questions about how digital infrastructures can reinforce or challenge systemic inequalities in underserved communities."
2511.05363,"This research category full paper investigates how community college instructors evaluate interactive, no-code AI literacy resources designed for non-STEM learners. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into everyday technologies, AI literacy - the ability to evaluate AI systems, communicate with them, and understand their broader impacts - has emerged as a critical skill across disciplines. Yet effective, scalable approaches for teaching these concepts in higher education remain limited, particularly for students outside STEM fields.To address this gap, we developed AI User, an interactive online curriculum that introduces core AI concepts through scenario - based activities set in real - world contexts. This study presents findings from four focus groups with instructors who engaged with AI User materials and participated in structured feedback activities. Thematic analysis revealed that instructors valued exploratory tasks that simulated real - world AI use cases and fostered experimentation, while also identifying challenges related to scaffolding, accessibility, and multi-modal support. A ranking task for instructional support materials showed a strong preference for interactive demonstrations over traditional educational materials like conceptual guides or lecture slides.These findings offer insights into instructor perspectives on making AI concepts more accessible and relevant for broad learner audiences. They also inform the design of AI literacy tools that align with diverse teaching contexts and support critical engagement with AI in higher education."
2511.0543,"As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly shapes decision-making across domains, there is a growing need to support AI literacy among learners beyond computer science. However, many current approaches rely on programming-heavy tools or abstract lecture-based content, limiting accessibility for non-STEM audiences. This paper presents findings from a study of AI User, a modular, web-based curriculum that teaches core AI concepts through interactive, no-code projects grounded in real-world scenarios. The curriculum includes eight projects; this study focuses on instructor feedback on Projects 5-8, which address applied topics such as natural language processing, computer vision, decision support, and responsible AI. Fifteen community college instructors participated in structured focus groups, completing the projects as learners and providing feedback through individual reflection and group discussion. Using thematic analysis, we examined how instructors evaluated the design, instructional value, and classroom applicability of these experiential activities. Findings highlight instructors' appreciation for exploratory tasks, role-based simulations, and real-world relevance, while also surfacing design trade-offs around cognitive load, guidance, and adaptability for diverse learners. This work extends prior research on AI literacy by centering instructor perspectives on teaching complex AI topics without code. It offers actionable insights for designing inclusive, experiential AI learning resources that scale across disciplines and learner backgrounds."
2511.05475,"As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become ubiquitous in professional contexts, there is an urgent need to equip workers, often with backgrounds outside of STEM, with the skills to use these tools effectively as well as responsibly, that is, to be AI literate. However, prevailing definitions and therefore assessments of AI literacy often emphasize foundational technical knowledge, such as programming, mathematics, and statistics, over practical knowledge such as interpreting model outputs, selecting tools, or identifying ethical concerns. This leaves a noticeable gap in assessing someone's AI literacy for real-world job use. We propose a work-task-oriented assessment model for AI literacy which is grounded in the competencies required for effective use of AI tools in professional settings. We describe the development of a novel AI literacy assessment instrument, and accompanying formative assessments, in the context of a US Navy robotics training program. The program included training in robotics and AI literacy, as well as a competition with practical tasks and a multiple choice scenario task meant to simulate use of AI in a job setting. We found that, as a measure of applied AI literacy, the competition's scenario task outperformed the tests we adopted from past research or developed ourselves. We argue that when training people for AI-related work, educators should consider evaluating them with instruments that emphasize highly contextualized practical skills rather than abstract technical knowledge, especially when preparing workers without technical backgrounds for AI-integrated roles."
2511.05526,"Chinese authorities are extending the country's four-phase emergency response framework (prevent, warn, respond, and recover) to address risks from advanced artificial intelligence (AI). Concrete mechanisms for the proactive prevention and warning phases, however, remain under development. This paper analyzes an implementation model inspired by international AI safety practices: frontier safety policies (FSPs). These policies feature pre-deployment evaluations for dangerous capabilities and tiered, pre-planned safety measures. We observe close alignment between FSPs and the proactive phases of China's emergency response framework, suggesting that the FSP model could help operationalize AI emergency preparedness in a manner consistent with China's established governance principles."
2511.0553,"One of the emergent challenges of student work submitted for assessment is the widespread use of large language models (LLMs) to support and even produce written work. This particularly affects subjects where long-form written work is a key part of assessment. We propose a novel approach to addressing this challenge, using LLMs themselves to support the assessment process. We have developed a proof-of-concept viva voce examination simulator, which accepts the student's written submission as input, generates an interactive series of questions from the LLM and answers from the student. The viva voce simulator is an interactive tool which asks questions which a human examiner might plausibly ask, and uses the student's answers to form a judgment about whether the submitted piece of work is likely to be the student's own work. The interaction transcript is provided to the human examiner to support their final judgment. We suggest theoretical and practical points which are critical to real-world deployment of such a tool."
2511.05543,"The act of posting a person's private photos or videos without their consent is known as revenge porn, and it is usually done to extort money or seek revenge. According to a 2010 cybercrime survey, about 18.3% of women were unaware that they were victims of revenge porn. In densely populated countries like India, such incidents are more likely, yet there is no specific law addressing revenge porn. This study used purposive sampling with a sample size of 200 unmarried women from Tamil Nadu aged 18 to 30. The survey results show that more than 50% had never heard the term ""revenge porn,"" and only about 5% had personally experienced it. About 40% believed the victim was at fault, while 43.5% were unsure whether pornographic websites should be banned. Around 11% admitted that they might upload explicit content as revenge, and 8.5% felt that due to cultural taboos around sex, society tends to blame the victim. Police officers should be trained in techniques for psychologically supporting victims. India, which ranks third globally in cybercrime, must adopt better preventive measures. Public awareness and targeted legal reforms could play a major role in reducing such crimes."
2511.05555,"Generative AI (GenAI) poses a substantial threat to the integrity of information within the contemporary public sphere, which increasingly relies on social media platforms as intermediaries for news consumption. At present, most research efforts are directed toward automated and machine learning-based detection methods, despite growing concerns regarding false positives, social and political biases, and susceptibility to circumvention. This dissertation instead adopts a human-centred approach. It proposes the Deception Decoder; a multimodal, systematic, and topological framework designed to support general users in identifying AI-generated misinformation and disinformation across text, image, and video. The framework was developed through a comparative synthesis of existing models, supplemented by a content analysis of GenAI-video, and refined through a small-scale focus group session. While initial testing indicates promising improvements, further research is required to confirm its generalisability across user groups, and sustained effectiveness over time."
2511.05572,"The potential of agricultural data (AgData) to drive efficiency and sustainability is stifled by the ""AgData Paradox"": a pervasive lack of trust and interoperability that locks data in silos, despite its recognized value. This paper introduces AgriTrust, a federated semantic governance framework designed to resolve this paradox. AgriTrust integrates a multi-stakeholder governance model, built on pillars of Data Sovereignty, Transparent Data Contracts, Equitable Value Sharing, and Regulatory Compliance, with a semantic digital layer. This layer is realized through the AgriTrust Core Ontology, a formal OWL ontology that provides a shared vocabulary for tokenization, traceability, and certification, enabling true semantic interoperability across independent platforms. A key innovation is a blockchain-agnostic, multi-provider architecture that prevents vendor lock-in. The framework's viability is demonstrated through case studies across three critical Brazilian supply chains: coffee (for EUDR compliance), soy (for mass balance), and beef (for animal tracking). The results show that AgriTrust successfully enables verifiable provenance, automates compliance, and creates new revenue streams for data producers, thereby transforming data sharing from a trust-based dilemma into a governed, automated operation. This work provides a foundational blueprint for a more transparent, efficient, and equitable agricultural data economy."
2511.05613,"Foundation models are increasingly central to high-stakes AI systems, and governance frameworks now depend on evaluations to assess their risks and capabilities. Although general capability evaluations are widespread, social impact assessments covering bias, fairness, privacy, environmental costs, and labor practices remain uneven across the AI ecosystem. To characterize this landscape, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of both first-party and third-party social impact evaluation reporting across a wide range of model developers. Our study examines 186 first-party release reports and 183 post-release evaluation sources, and complements this quantitative analysis with interviews of model developers. We find a clear division of evaluation labor: first-party reporting is sparse, often superficial, and has declined over time in key areas such as environmental impact and bias, while third-party evaluators including academic researchers, nonprofits, and independent organizations provide broader and more rigorous coverage of bias, harmful content, and performance disparities. However, this complementarity has limits. Only model developers can authoritatively report on data provenance, content moderation labor, financial costs, and training infrastructure, yet interviews reveal that these disclosures are often deprioritized unless tied to product adoption or regulatory compliance. Our findings indicate that current evaluation practices leave major gaps in assessing AI's societal impacts, highlighting the urgent need for policies that promote developer transparency, strengthen independent evaluation ecosystems, and create shared infrastructure to aggregate and compare third-party evaluations in a consistent and accessible way."
2511.05625,"Educational dialogue -the collaborative exchange of ideas through talk- is widely recognized as a catalyst for deeper learning and critical thinking in and across contexts. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a powerful force in education, with the potential to address major challenges, personalize learning, and innovate teaching practices. However, these advances come with significant risks: rapid AI development can undermine human agency, exacerbate inequities, and outpace our capacity to guide its use with sound policy. Human learning presupposes cognitive efforts and social interaction (dialogues). In response to this evolving landscape, an international workshop titled ""Educational Dialogue: Moving Thinking Forward"" convened 19 leading researchers from 11 countries in Cambridge (September 1-3, 2025) to examine the intersection of AI and educational dialogue. This AI-focused strand of the workshop centered on three critical questions: (1) When is AI truly useful in education, and when might it merely replace human effort at the expense of learning? (2) Under what conditions can AI use lead to better dialogic teaching and learning? (3) Does the AI-human partnership risk outpacing and displacing human educational work, and what are the implications? These questions framed two days of presentations and structured dialogue among participants."
2511.05627,"Accessing legal help in Bangladesh is hard. People face high fees, complex legal language, a shortage of lawyers, and millions of unresolved court cases. Generative AI models like OpenAI GPT-4.1 Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Meta Llama 3 70B, and DeepSeek R1 could potentially democratize legal assistance by providing quick and affordable legal advice. In this study, we collected 250 authentic legal questions from the Facebook group ""Know Your Rights,"" where verified legal experts regularly provide authoritative answers. These questions were subsequently submitted to four four advanced AI models and responses were generated using a consistent, standardized prompt. A comprehensive dual evaluation framework was employed, in which a state-of-the-art LLM model served as a judge, assessing each AI-generated response across four critical dimensions: factual accuracy, legal appropriateness, completeness, and clarity. Following this, the same set of questions was evaluated by three licensed Bangladeshi legal professionals according to the same criteria. In addition, automated evaluation metrics, including BLEU scores, were applied to assess response similarity. Our findings reveal a complex landscape where AI models frequently generate high-quality, well-structured legal responses but also produce dangerous misinformation, including fabricated case citations, incorrect legal procedures, and potentially harmful advice. These results underscore the critical need for rigorous expert validation and comprehensive safeguards before AI systems can be safely deployed for legal consultation in Bangladesh."
2511.05713,"This paper identifies the primary topics of interest of organizations participating in the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the leading standards body for the Web. Using publicly available data from the W3C website, we analyze the participation of member organizations in W3C groups, treating the number of representatives allocated to each group as a proxy for their interests. By applying topic modeling and similarity analysis to these participation patterns, we uncover clusters of related groups and shared priorities among organizations. The results reveal five prominent areas of focus -- Web, Ads & Privacy; High Performance; Credentials & Web of Things; Accessibility; and Payments -- and show that large enterprises, particularly those based in the United States, dominate participation in core Web development and advertising-related topics, while Japanese organizations are more active in the Web of Things. These findings offer insights into how various stakeholders influence the standardization process and how the Web may evolve in the coming years."
2511.05714,"Advances in AI threaten to invalidate assumptions underpinning today's defense architecture. We argue that the current U.S. defense program of record, designed in an era before capable machine intelligence, cannot by itself preserve national security against rapidly emerging AI enabled threats. Instead, shoring up legacy systems must be coupled with entirely new elements of a defense architecture. We outline immediate steps to adapt the Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration National Laboratories to ensure agility and resilience in an era of powerful AI."
2511.05764,"Problem decomposition--the ability to break down a large task into smaller, well-defined components--is a critical skill for effectively designing and creating large programs, but it is often not included in introductory computer science curricula. With the rise of generative AI (GenAI), students even at the introductory level are able to generate large quantities of code, and it is becoming increasingly important to equip them with the ability to decompose problems. There is not yet a consensus among educators on how to best teach and assess the skill of decomposition, particularly in introductory computing. This practitioner paper details the development of questions to assess the skill of problem decomposition, and impressions about how these questions were received by students. A challenge unique to problem decomposition questions is their necessarily lengthy context, and we detail our approach to addressing this problem using Question Suites: scaffolded sequences of questions that help students understand a question's context before attempting to decompose it. We then describe the use of open-ended drawing of decomposition diagrams as another form of assessment. We outline the learning objectives used to design our questions and describe how we addressed challenges encountered in early iterations. We present our decomposition assessment materials and reflections on them for educators who wish to teach problem decomposition to beginner programmers."
2511.05819,"Previous work has found a lack of research in HCI on religion, partly driven by misunderstandings of values and practices between religious and technical communities. To bridge this divide in an empirically rigorous way, we conducted an interview study with 48 religious people and/or experts from 11 faiths, and we document how religious people experience, understand, and imagine technologies. We show that religious stakeholders find non-neutral secular embeddings in technologies and the firms and people that design them, and how these manifest in unintended harms for religious and nonreligious users. Our findings reveal how users navigate technoreligious practices with religiously informed mental models and what they desire from technologies. Informed by this, we distill six design values -- wonder, humility, space, embodiedness, community, and eternity -- to guide technologists in considering and leveraging religion as an additional, valid sociocultural resource when designing for a holistic user. We further spell out directions for future research."
2511.05903,"User simulation is important for developing and evaluating human-centered AI, yet current student simulation in educational applications has significant limitations. Existing approaches focus on single learning experiences and do not account for students' gradual knowledge construction and evolving skill sets. Moreover, large language models are optimized to produce direct and accurate responses, making it challenging to represent the incomplete understanding and developmental constraints that characterize real learners. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics. In practice, we implement a curriculum-aligned simulator grounded on the Next Generation Science Standards. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively reflect the gradual nature of knowledge development and the characteristic difficulties students face, providing a more accurate representation of learning processes."
2511.05914,"We introduce a conceptual framework and provide considerations for the institutional design of AI incident reporting systems, i.e., processes for collecting information about safety- and rights-related events caused by general-purpose AI. As general-purpose AI systems are increasingly adopted, they are causing more real-world harms and displaying the potential to cause significantly more dangerous incidents - events that did or could have caused harm to individuals, property, or the environment. Through a literature review, we develop a framework for understanding the institutional design of AI incident reporting systems, which includes seven dimensions: policy goal, actors submitting and receiving reports, type of incidents reported, level of risk materialization, enforcement of reporting, anonymity of reporters, and post-reporting actions. We then examine nine case studies of incident reporting in safety-critical industries to extract design considerations for AI incident reporting in the United States. We discuss, among other factors, differences in systems operated by regulatory vs. non-regulatory government agencies, near miss reporting, the roles of mandatory reporting thresholds and voluntary reporting channels, how to enable safety learning after reporting, sharing incident information, and clarifying legal frameworks for reporting. Our aim is to inform researchers and policymakers about when particular design choices might be more or less appropriate for AI incident reporting."
2511.05927,"The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) raises a central question: are investments in compute infrastructure matched by an equally robust build-out of skills, incentives, and governance? Grounded in socio-technical systems (STS) theory, this mixed-methods study audits workforce preparedness across Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman. We combine term frequency--inverse document frequency (TF--IDF) analysis of six national AI strategies (NASs), an inventory of 47 publicly disclosed AI initiatives (January 2017--April 2025), paired case studies, the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and the Saudi Data & Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) Academy, and a scenario matrix linking oil-revenue slack (technical capacity) to regulatory coherence (social alignment). Across the corpus, 34/47 initiatives (0.72; 95% Wilson CI 0.58--0.83) exhibit joint social--technical design; country-level indices span 0.57--0.90 (small n; intervals overlap). Scenario results suggest that, under our modeled conditions, regulatory convergence plausibly binds outcomes more than fiscal capacity: fragmented rules can offset high oil revenues, while harmonized standards help preserve progress under austerity. We also identify an emerging two-track talent system, research elites versus rapidly trained practitioners, that risks labor-market bifurcation without bridging mechanisms. By extending STS inquiry to oil-rich, state-led economies, the study refines theory and sets a research agenda focused on longitudinal coupling metrics, ethnographies of coordination, and outcome-based performance indicators."
2511.05932,"Comparative evidence on how Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states turn artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions into post--New Public Management (post-NPM) outcomes is scarce because most studies examine Western democracies. We analyze constitutional, collective-choice, and operational rules shaping AI uptake in two contrasting GCC members, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait, and whether they foster citizen centricity, collaborative governance, and public value creation. Anchored in Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development framework, the study combines a most similar/most different systems design with multiple sources: 62 public documents from 2018--2025, embedded UAE cases (Smart Dubai and MBZUAI), and 39 interviews with officials conducted Aug 2024--May 2025. Dual coding and process tracing connect rule configurations to AI performance. Cross-case analysis identifies four reinforcing mechanisms behind divergent trajectories. In the UAE, concentrated authority, credible sanctions, pro-innovation narratives, and flexible reinvestment rules scale pilots into hundreds of services and sizable recycled savings. In Kuwait, dispersed veto points, exhortative sanctions, cautious discourse, and lapsed AI budgets confine initiatives to pilot mode despite equivalent fiscal resources. The findings refine institutional theory by showing that vertical rule coherence, not wealth, determines AI's public-value yield, and temper post-NPM optimism by revealing that efficiency metrics serve societal goals only when backed by enforceable safeguards. To curb ethics washing and test transferability beyond the GCC, future work should track rule diffusion over time, develop blended legitimacy--efficiency scorecards, and examine how narrative framing shapes citizen consent for data sharing."
2511.05953,"In recent years, the music research community has examined risks of AI models for music, with generative AI models in particular, raised concerns about copyright, deepfakes, and transparency. In our work, we raise concerns about cultural and genre biases in AI for music systems (music-AI systems) which affect stakeholders including creators, distributors, and listeners shaping representation in AI for music. These biases can misrepresent marginalized traditions, especially from the Global South, producing inauthentic outputs (e.g., distorted ragas) that reduces creators' trust on these systems. Such harms risk reinforcing biases, limiting creativity, and contributing to cultural erasure. To address this, we offer recommendations at dataset, model and interface level in music-AI systems."
2511.06078,"Simulated Students offer a valuable methodological framework for evaluating pedagogical approaches and modelling diverse learner profiles, tasks which are otherwise challenging to undertake systematically in real-world settings. Recent research has increasingly focused on developing such simulated agents to capture a range of learning styles, cognitive development pathways, and social behaviours. Among contemporary simulation techniques, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational research has emerged as a particularly versatile and scalable paradigm. LLMs afford a high degree of linguistic realism and behavioural adaptability, enabling agents to approximate cognitive processes and engage in contextually appropriate pedagogical dialogues. This paper presents a thematic review of empirical and methodological studies utilising LLMs to simulate student behaviour across educational environments. We synthesise current evidence on the capacity of LLM-based agents to emulate learner archetypes, respond to instructional inputs, and interact within multi-agent classroom scenarios. Furthermore, we examine the implications of such systems for curriculum development, instructional evaluation, and teacher training. While LLMs surpass rule-based systems in natural language generation and situational flexibility, ongoing concerns persist regarding algorithmic bias, evaluation reliability, and alignment with educational objectives. The review identifies existing technological and methodological gaps and proposes future research directions for integrating generative AI into adaptive learning systems and instructional design."
2511.06148,"As large language models (LLMs) are adopted into frameworks that grant them the capacity to make real decisions, it is increasingly important to ensure that they are unbiased. In this paper, we argue that the predominant approach of simply removing existing biases from models is not enough. Using a paradigm from the psychology literature, we demonstrate that LLMs can spontaneously develop novel social biases about artificial demographic groups even when no inherent differences exist. These biases result in highly stratified task allocations, which are less fair than assignments by human participants and are exacerbated by newer and larger models. In social science, emergent biases like these have been shown to result from exploration-exploitation trade-offs, where the decision-maker explores too little, allowing early observations to strongly influence impressions about entire demographic groups. To alleviate this effect, we examine a series of interventions targeting model inputs, problem structure, and explicit steering. We find that explicitly incentivizing exploration most robustly reduces stratification, highlighting the need for better multifaceted objectives to mitigate bias. These results reveal that LLMs are not merely passive mirrors of human social biases, but can actively create new ones from experience, raising urgent questions about how these systems will shape societies over time."
2511.06191,"Defensive organization is critical in soccer, particularly during negative transitions when teams are most vulnerable. The back-four defensive line plays a decisive role in preventing goal-scoring opportunities, yet its collective coordination remains difficult to quantify. This study introduces interpretable spatio-temporal indicators namely, space control, stretch index, pressure index, and defensive line height (absolute and relative) to evaluate the effectiveness of the back-four during defensive transitions. Using synchronized tracking and event data from the 2023-24 LaLiga season, 2,413 defensive sequences were analyzed following possession losses by FC Barcelona and Real Madrid CF. Two-way ANOVA revealed significant effects of team, outcome, and their interaction for key indicators, with relative line height showing the strongest association with defensive success. Predictive modeling using XGBoost achieved the highest discriminative performance (ROC AUC: 0.724 for Barcelona, 0.698 for Real Madrid), identifying space score and relative line height as dominant predictors. Comparative analysis revealed distinct team-specific defensive behaviors: Barcelona's success was characterized by higher spatial control and compact line coordination, whereas Real Madrid exhibited more adaptive but less consistent defensive structures. These findings demonstrate the tactical and predictive value of interpretable spatial indicators for quantifying collective defensive performance."
2511.06472,"In this paper, we argue that anthropomorphized technology, designed to simulate emotional realism, are not neutral tools but cognitive infrastructures that manipulate user trust and behaviour. This reinforces the logic of surveillance capitalism, an under-regulated economic system that profits from behavioural manipulation and monitoring. Drawing on Nicholas Carr's theory of the intellectual ethic, we identify how technologies such as chatbots, virtual assistants, or generative models reshape not only what we think about ourselves and our world, but how we think at the cognitive level. We identify how the emerging intellectual ethic of AI benefits a system of surveillance capitalism, and discuss the potential ways of addressing this."
2511.06525,"Effective governance of artificial intelligence (AI) requires public engagement, yet communication strategies centered on existential risk have not produced sustained mobilization. In this paper, we examine the psychological and opinion barriers that limit engagement with extinction narratives, such as mortality avoidance, exponential growth bias, and the absence of self-referential anchors. We contrast them with evidence that public concern over AI rises when framed in terms of proximate harms such as employment disruption, relational instability, and mental health issues. We validate these findings through actual message testing with 1063 respondents, with the evidence showing that AI risks to Jobs and Children have the highest potential to mobilize people, while Existential Risk is the lowest-performing theme across all demographics. Using survey data from five countries, we identify two segments (Tech-Positive Urbanites and World Guardians) as particularly receptive to such framing and more likely to participate in civic action. Finally, we argue that mobilization around these everyday concerns can raise the political salience of AI, creating ""policy demand"" for structural measures to mitigate AI risks. We conclude that this strategy creates the conditions for successful regulatory change."
2511.067,"How do we make a meaningful comparison of a large language model's knowledge of the law in one place compared to another? Quantifying these differences is critical to understanding if the quality of the legal information obtained by users of LLM-based chatbots varies depending on their location. However, obtaining meaningful comparative metrics is challenging because legal institutions in different places are not themselves easily comparable. In this work we propose a methodology to obtain place-to-place metrics based on the comparative law concept of functionalism. We construct a dataset of factual scenarios drawn from Reddit posts by users seeking legal advice for family, housing, employment, crime and traffic issues. We use these to elicit a summary of a law from the LLM relevant to each scenario in Los Angeles, London and Sydney. These summaries, typically of a legislative provision, are manually evaluated for hallucinations. We show that the rate of hallucination of legal information by leading closed-source LLMs is significantly associated with place. This suggests that the quality of legal solutions provided by these models is not evenly distributed across geography. Additionally, we show a strong negative correlation between hallucination rate and the frequency of the majority response when the LLM is sampled multiple times, suggesting a measure of uncertainty of model predictions of legal facts."
