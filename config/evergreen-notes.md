# First prompt
Create the evergreen note from these rows. Read first every single abstract. Don't summarize the abstracts but connect the dots, understand how this massive collective effort can be conveyed in one comprehensive outcome.

# Second one:
After that, add a section where you challenge all what makes no sense from the input I sent you.

# Last one:
Do you think that you missed something when you were creating the evergreen notes of all of these papers? any blind spot or topic that you think that we should be considering or asking ourselves, or also what are some open questions that we haven't noticed, identified?
